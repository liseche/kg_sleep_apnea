The rules for PSG testing and scoring are divided over seven chapters (II-VIII) of the manual. Chapter II specifies all of the parameters ( that should be reported in a routine PSG test. Chapter Ill details the digital and filter settings that are recommended for routine PSG recording. Chapters IV-VIII provide add itional technical specifications as well as scoring rules for the major categories of testing: sleep staging, arousal, cardiac, movement, and respiratory. Chapter IX provides technical specifications and scoring 0 rules for home sleep apnea testing including those utilizi ng respiratory flow and/or effort and those utilizi ng peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT). Chapter X (Development Process) details the process by which the rules were developed. An outline of the evidence level and decision-making process for each rule may be found in chapter XI (Procedural Notes).

Note 2. Note 3. Note 4. Note 5. Note 6. In the absence of clear preferences, use similar settings among leads to simplify technical implementation. This applies to measured EEG and EOG electrode impedance. Electrode impedances should be rechecked during a recording when any pattern that might be artifact ual appears. For EEG, 500 Hz sampling rate could improve resolution of spikes in the EEG and better maintain details of the waveform. For more detailed EEG analysis, sampling rate and high-frequency filter settings may be increased. I n these circumstances, the sampling rate should be at least 3 times the highest frequency of interest. For EOG, using the 500 Hz desirable EEG sampling rate also allows the reflection of the EEG in th is lead as an EEG backup and may better define some artifacts in these leads. This applies to submental and leg EMG. Higher sampling rates better define waveforms; while the waveform itself is not an issue, a better-defi ned waveform can help avoid amplitude attenuation as the envelope of the rapidly oscillating signal is interpreted. Note 7. For ECG, 500 Hz sampling rate can better define pacemaker spikes and ECG waveforms, however, pacemaker spikes can be seen at 200 Hz, and the evaluation of card iac\n",

      "Transcription: ischemia by ECG waveform is not a common PSG issue. Higher frequencies may be required for complex waveform analysis and research appl ications. Note 8. For oximetry, 25 Hz sampling is desirable to assist with artifact evaluation. Note 9. For nasal pressure transducer technology (especially with settings which identify snoring occurring on top of the airflow waveform), this higher frequency may be of benefit for better definition of vibration and snoring. Note 10. The body position channel is exempt from the digital resolution standard. However, the recommended sampling rate of I Hz remains i n effect. Note 11. For snoring sound, 500 Hz sampling rate can better define amplitude variation by clearer waveforms with more accurate amplitude determination as the envelope of the rapid ly oscillating signal is interpreted, (as for EMG). If a preprocessing of snoring results i n a continuous sound loudness level or i n a sound intensity level, then a much lower sampling rate is acceptable. That sampling rate is not specified because it depends on the preprocessing of the sound i n order to produce loudness. 0 Note 12. For rib cage and abdominal movements using inductance plethysmography, cardiogenic oscillations can be 0 better seen and may result i n better artifact assessment at a higher sampling rate. Note 13. To accommodate older equipment, filter settings in the range of 30-35 Hz may be used to comply with the recommendations of 35 Hz. This applies most specifically in the context of EEG and EOG h igh filter settings. Note 14. For ECG, low-frequency settings and wide bandwidth mini mizes distortion i n a 12 lead ECG; however in 0 PSG recording with single-channel modified lead II used for identifying basic heart rates and dysrhythmias, it may not be as necessary. Advanced cardiac assessment may be more optimal using a [ow-frequency filter of 0.3 Hz for slower parts of the cardiac cycle. The channel is susceptible to artifacts at this setting due to patient movement, perspiration, muscle activity and electrode displacement. Artifact is less l ikely at these settings when standard ECG leads are used for cardiac monitoring.

Conceptional age (CA) is gestational age (GA) at birth plus the number of weeks postpartum. GA is the I time elapsed between the first day of the mother's last menstrual period and the day of delivery expressed i n \\ completed weeks. If the pregnancy was achieved usi ng assisted reproductive technology, GA is calculated by adding 2 weeks to the CA. Chronological age (or postnatal or legal age) is the time elapsed since birth (can be expressed in days, months, or years). Note 2. At birth, an i nfant is classified as one of the following: premature ( 37 weeks gestation); full-term (37-42 weeks); or post-term (born after 42 weeks). A neonate is a child during the first 28 days after birth;an infant is a child age Ito 12 months.• Note 3. Knowing an infant's CA is crucial for interpreting the normalcy, immaturity or abnormality of an EEG or PSG because the brain and the EEG continue to develop and mature at a similar rate independent of whether the infant is in utero or post-deliver y.

Periodic breathing is common during stage R sleep and may rarely occu r during stage N sleep i n normal infants. Note 7. The EEG patterns of transitional sleep may contain any of the EEG characteristics outl ined in Table 3. Note 8. Pathological EEG waveforms, such as those from spike and slow wave, projected rhythms or those generated due to underlyi ng pathology, shou ld not be included in defi ning stage or state as noted in Table 3. Note 9. It is permissible to look at preceding and following epochs to identify the trace alternant (TA) pattern. Note 10. Trace alternant (TA) fi rst appears at 37 weeks conceptional age (CA), is the predominant EEG pattern in stage N sleep at 40 weeks CA and unl i kely to be seen after 44 weeks CA. After 42 weeks CA, interburst intervals (IBls) of TA last on ly 1-2 seconds and the IBI is of higher ampl itude. TA after 44 weeks CA is replaced by high voltage slow (HVS) activity. Note 11. H igh voltage slow (HVS) activity is the more mature EEG pattern of stage N sleep at term. It is characterized by continuous synchronous symmetrical 100-150 µV 1-3 Hz delta activity which often has an occipital or central predom inance. Note 12. Since rudimentary sleep spind les first appear at 43 to 48 weeks CA at the midl ine central (Cz, vertex) region and are often asynchronous, simultaneous d isplay ofleft, right and midline central EEG channels may be considered (eg, C3-Cz, Cz-C4). I n infants this age, sleep spindles are often low voltage 12-14 Hz, not the wider range of 1 1-16 Hz seen at later ages. Note 13. Since sleep spindles are often asynchronous in children until 2 years of age, simu ltaneous display of the recom mended and back up electrodes may be considered (eg, montage to consider: F3-M2, F4-M I, C3-M2, C4-M l, Oi-M2, 02-M l , C3-Cz, Cz-C4).

If the apnea or hypopnea event begins or ends during an epoch that is scored as sleep, then the correspond ing respi ratory event can be scored and included in the computation of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHi).

More information on the methods used and the evidence examined by the SAD task force may be found in the 2012 review paper publ ished i n the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medici11e.1 The content of the chapters on parameters to be reported, technical and digital specifications, visual rules (now sleep staging rules), arousal rules, card iac rules and movement rules remains largely unchanged from the first edition of the AASM Scoring Manual published in 2007. The 2007 manual shou ld be consu lted for the development process of these chapters.3 The Scoring Manual Com mittee, two members of which also served on the SAD Task Force, drafted ru les for a new respiratory chapter based on the recommendations i n the SAD Task Force review paper.2 Headings and formatting throughout the manual were edited for clarity and consistency. Critical termi nology was made up-to-date and consistent. The use of certain defi nitions in the manual were made into rules to emphasize their importance. Scoring Manual FAQs from the AASM website were incorporated as notes i n the appropriate sections of the manual. Al ready existing notes i n the manual were examined for relevance and clarity. New figures were designed for the sleep staging rules chapter that better illustrate the ru les for scoring sleep stages. Upon completion of the edits, all rules, figures and notes were re-edited and re-voted on until there was consensus agreement among the commit­ tee. The AASM Board of Directors approved Version 2.0 of the A ASM Scoring Manual i n July 2012. - - - - - - -- - - - Future Versions According to the tenets of evidence-based medici ne, clinical decision-making should be guided by the best evidence from the research field, the expertise of the clin ician, and the expectations and values of the patient. The AASM is comm itted to util izing evidence-based med icine in the updating of the A ASM Scoring Manual. Systematic literature searches are conducted to collect all available evidence.

Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT): A technique allowi ng noninvasive moment-to-moment measurement of sympathetic tone using finger plethysmography (measurement of pu lsatile volume changes in the finger tip that reflects changes i n sympathetic tone). Increases in sympathetic tone resu lt in peripheral arterial constriction and reduced blood flow to the digit. The reduced volu me at the finger is detected by the probe. The combination of a decrease in PAT signal (sympathetic tone increase following respiratory events), a fa[[ in Sa02 (oximetry), and an increase i n heart rate is used to detect respiratory events.
