Introduction	
Classification	
of	
disorders	
plays	
several	
key	
roles	
in	
medicine	
.	

The	
most	
familiar	
of	
these	
is	
that	
is	
serves	
as	
a	
guide	
to	
clinicians	
in	
the	
identification	
of	
specific	
disease	
states	
.	

In	
doing	
so	
,	
classification	
systems	
provide	
clinicians	
with	
important	
informa-	
tion	
regarding	
numerous	
related	
factors	
including	
pathogenesis	
,	
prognosis	
,	
course	
,	
and	
heritability	
.	

Moreover	
,	
therapeutic	
interventions	
are	
largely	
guided	
by	
the	
nosologi-	
cal	
decisions	
made	
by	
clinicians	
.	

In	
turn	
,	
information	
accrued	
regarding	
therapeutic	
response	
of	
these	
disease	
states	
is	
utilized	
to	
further	
refine	
the	
nosology	
.	

Classification	
systems	
also	
serve	
to	
define	
the	
domain	
of	
a	
given	
discipline	
,	
a	
factor	
of	
particular	
importance	
for	
fields	
such	
as	
sleep	
medicine	
which	
cut	
across	
many	
related	
special-	
ties	
.	

Finally	
,	
by	
identifying	
areas	
of	
uncertainty	
and	
overlap	
among	
related	
patholo-	
gies	
,	
these	
systems	
play	
a	
critical	
role	
in	
guiding	
future	
research	
agendas	
which	
will	
enhance	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
clinical	
features	
,	
pathophysiology	
and	
treatment	
response	
specific	
to	
each	
disorder	
.	

Since	
its	
infancy	
35	
years	
ago	
,	
the	
field	
of	
sleep	
medicine	
has	
paid	
particular	
atten-	
tion	
to	
the	
issue	
of	
classification	
,	
beginning	
with	
the	
1979	
American	
Sleep	
Disorders	
Association	
’s	
Diagnostic	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Arousal	
Disorders	
.	

Since	
that	
time	
,	
as	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
sleep	
disorders	
has	
grown	
,	
several	
differ-	
ent	
structural	
approaches	
have	
been	
utilized	
in	
revisions	
of	
the	
classification	
system	
,	
culminating	
in	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
.	

The	
organization	
of	
that	
edition	
,	
although	
not	
without	
its	
limitations	
,	
has	
proven	
effective	
and	
user	
-	
friendly	
and	
has	
been	
maintained	
in	
the	
current	
revision	
.	

Ideally	
,	
classification	
systems	
are	
based	
largely	
on	
pathophysiology	
.	

However	
,	
such	
an	
approach	
is	
dependent	
on	
adequate	
knowledge	
concerning	
the	
various	
pathophysiol-	
ogies	
of	
disease	
or	
disorder	
within	
a	
given	
discipline	
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
with	
many	
diag-	
nostic	
systems	
,	
our	
current	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
many	
sleep	
disorders	
is	
inadequate	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
,	
not	
unlike	
its	
predecessors	
,	
employs	
a	
hybrid	
approach	
which	
utilizes	
pathophysiology	
,	
where	
known	
,	
but	
also	
relies	
heavily	
on	
phenomenology	
and	
organ	ORGAN
system	
approaches	
.	

Despite	
these	
shortcomings	
,	
this	
approach	
is	
one	
that	
has	
proven	
familiar	
and	
workable	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
clinicians	
.	

Recognizing	
the	
need	
for	
currency	
and	
relevance	
in	
a	
rapidly	
evolving	
field	
,	
the	
American	
Academy	
of	
Sleep	
Medicine	
Board	
of	
Directors	
approved	
a	
revision	
of	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
in	
2011	
.	

Following	
appoint-	
ment	
of	
a	
chair	
/	
editor	
,	
a	
task	
force	
,	
consisting	
of	
individual	
work	
group	
chairs	
for	
each	
Introduction	
major	
division	
of	
the	
manual	
,	
was	
selected	
,	
along	
with	
two	
pediatric	
consultants	
.	

A	
focus	
group	
of	
experts	
was	
convened	
in	
June	
2011	
to	
obtain	
input	
on	
major	
structural	
and	
content	
issues	
.	

Based	
on	
this	
feedback	
,	
individual	
work	
groups	
then	
set	
about	
to	
define	
the	
list	
of	
disorders	
to	
be	
included	
within	
their	
sections	
as	
well	
as	
proposed	
cri-	CANCER
teria	
for	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

This	
process	
included	
comprehensive	
literature	
searches	
for	
every	
potential	
diagnosis	
as	
well	
as	
for	
their	
major	
features	
.	

The	
draft	
diagnostic	
crite-	
ria	
which	
emanated	
from	
this	
work	
were	
then	
reviewed	
and	
modified	
by	
the	
task	
force	
(	
consisting	
of	
the	
work	
group	
chairs	
and	
pediatric	
advisors	
)	
,	
as	
well	
as	
by	
the	
board	
of	
the	
AASM	
.	

The	
edited	
criteria	
were	
then	
distributed	
to	
external	
peer	
reviewers	
with	
expertise	
in	
the	
respective	
areas	
,	
as	
well	
as	
to	
international	
societies	
and	
membership	
sections	
of	
the	
AASM	
for	
comment	
.	

These	
reviews	
were	
carefully	
considered	
and	
revi-	
sions	
made	
based	
on	
this	
input	
.	

Subsequent	
to	
this	
,	
text	
revisions	
were	
begun	
and	
the	
same	
review	
process	
and	
modifications	
were	
undertaken	
once	
text	
drafts	
were	
com-	
pleted	
.	

Further	
modifications	
were	
made	
based	
on	
recommendations	
from	
the	
AASM	
board	
before	
finalization	
of	
the	
edition	
.	

At	
all	
points	
in	
this	
process	
,	
efforts	
were	
made	
to	
rely	
as	
heavily	
as	
possible	
on	
available	
and	
current	
scientific	
evidence	
.	

However	
,	
due	
to	
the	
paucity	
of	
available	
evidence	
in	
many	
areas	
,	
decisions	
regarding	
the	
nosol-	
ogy	
were	
often	
made	
by	
consensus	
of	
the	
work	
groups	
,	
task	
force	
,	
and	
reviewers	
.	

Using	
ICSD-3	
As	
noted	
above	
,	
the	
general	
structure	
of	
the	
current	
edition	
closely	
parallels	
that	
of	
the	
second	
edition	
.	

The	
major	
clinical	
divisions	
remain	
unchanged	
.	

As	
with	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
,	
pediatric	
diagnoses	
are	
fully	
integrated	
into	
the	
major	
clinical	
diagnoses	
,	
with	
the	
exception	
of	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
,	
pediatric	
.	

Where	
pediatric	
presentations	
call	
for	
variation	
in	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
,	
those	
variations	
are	
noted	
within	
the	
criteria	
section	
.	

In	
an	
effort	
to	
better	
identify	
those	
clinical	
features	
of	
a	
disorder	
which	
are	
developmentally	
-	
specific	
,	
a	
text	
heading	
for	
Developmental	
Issues	
has	
been	
added	
for	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

Specific	
ICD	
codes	
(	
9	
-	
CM	
and	
10	
-	
CM	
)	
are	
listed	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

Because	
of	
the	
complexities	
and	
differences	
between	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
diagnoses	
and	
the	
ICD	
system	
,	
assign-	
ment	
of	
codes	
is	
challenging	
.	

These	
issues	
are	
discussed	
further	
under	
Coding	
below	
.	

Although	
classification	
systems	
are	
,	
by	
their	
nature	
,	
intended	
to	
define	
disorders	
in	
the	
most	
specific	
terms	
possible	
,	
clinicians	
must	
recognize	
that	
there	
is	
inevitably	
some	
degree	
of	
variability	
in	
presentation	
which	
may	
result	
in	
clinically	
significant	
conditions	
which	
do	
not	
meet	
all	
specific	
criteria	
for	
a	
given	
diagnosis	
.	

Therefore	
,	
some	
degree	
of	
judgment	
is	
necessary	
in	
the	
application	
of	
these	
criteria	
.	

Bearing	
this	
exception	
in	
mind	
,	
all	
listed	
criteria	
should	
generally	
be	
met	
for	
establishment	
of	
a	
given	
diagnosis	
,	
unless	
otherwise	
specified	
.	

Clinicians	
should	
note	
that	
most	
diagnoses	
within	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
include	
a	
criterion	
,	
or	
cri-	CANCER
teria	
,	
that	
connote	
clinical	
significance	
(	
i.e.	
,	
disturbing	
symptoms	
,	
significant	
conse-	
quences	
,	
distress	
or	
impairment	
in	
one	
or	
more	
functional	
realms	
)	
.	

These	
criteria	
are	
particularly	
important	
because	
,	
without	
them	
,	
many	
phenomena	
related	
to	
sleep	
-	
wake	
do	
not	
rise	
to	
a	
level	
that	
requires	
clinical	
attention	
and	
treatment	
.	

Users	
should	
also	
pay	
particular	
attention	
to	
the	
Notes	
section	
(	
where	
included	
)	
,	
as	
these	
notes	
provide	
essential	
definitions	
and	
details	
concerning	
application	
of	
the	
criteria	
.	

Clinicians	
will	
note	
a	
number	
of	
significant	
content	
changes	
from	
the	
former	
edition	
.	

The	
most	
apparent	
of	
these	
is	
the	
collapse	
of	
all	
previous	
chronic	
insomnia	
diagnoses	
into	
a	
single	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
diagnosis	
.	

The	
rationale	
for	
this	
is	
described	
in	
the	
introductory	
section	
of	
Insomnia	
disorders	
.	

A	
separate	
diagnosis	
is	
retained	
for	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
.	

Within	
the	
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	
section	
,	
the	
nomenclature	
for	
narcolepsy	
has	
been	
changed	
to	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
and	
type	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
2	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

This	
modification	
is	
discussed	
in	
the	
introduction	
to	
that	
section	
.	

Users	
will	
also	
find	
several	
new	
diagnoses	
within	
the	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
.	

Within	
the	
Central	
Sleep	
Apnea	
Syndromes	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
central	
sleep	
apnea	
now	
appears	
.	

This	
term	
is	
preferred	
to	
the	
widely	
used	
term	
complex	
sleep	
apnea	
because	
it	
describes	
a	
more	
specific	
and	
well	
-	
defined	
disorder	
in	
which	
the	
central	
apnea	
arises	
in	
the	
context	
of	
positive	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
pressure	
treatment	
for	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
and	
is	
not	
attributable	
to	
another	
cause	
.	

Central	
sleep	
apnea	
associated	
with	
other	
identi-	
fiable	
etiologies	
such	
as	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
breathing	
or	
substance	
-	
induced	
central	
sleep	
apnea	
are	
not	
classified	
as	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
.	

Assigning	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
a	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
disorder	
requires	
demonstration	
of	
elevated	
PaCO2	
(	
by	
direct	
measure	
of	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
blood	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
gas	
or	
,	
more	
commonly	
,	
by	
proxy	
measures	
such	
as	
end	
-	
tidal	
or	
trans-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
cutaneous	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
determination	
)	
.	

The	
new	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
disor-	
der	
should	
be	
employed	
when	
there	
is	
sustained	
drop	
in	
SaO2	
but	
PaCO2	
has	
not	
been	
measured	
.	

Within	
the	
parasomnia	
section	
,	
a	
single	
set	
of	
general	
criteria	
and	
a	
unified	
text	
now	
describe	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
from	
non	
-	
rapid	
eye	ORGAN
movement	
sleep	
,	
although	
additional	
,	
specific	
criteria	
and	
separate	
coding	
are	
maintained	
for	
the	
diagnoses	
within	
this	
section	
(	
i.e.	
,	
confusional	
arousal	
,	
sleepwalking	
and	
sleep	
terror	
)	
.	

Other	
,	
somewhat	
less	
consequential	
additions	
,	
deletions	
and

Relationship	
to	
Other	
Classification	
Systems	
Historically	
,	
there	
have	
been	
three	
major	
classifications	
systems	
for	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

Although	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
system	
has	
,	
for	
many	
years	
,	
been	
the	
primary	
nosology	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
specialists	
,	
both	
the	
Diagnostic	
and	
Statistical	
Manual	
of	
Mental	
Disorders	
(	
DSM	
)	
of	
the	
American	
Psychiatric	
Association	
and	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Diseases	
(	
ICD	
)	
nosology	
of	
the	
World	
Health	
Organization	
have	
also	
classified	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

Unfortunately	
,	
these	
competing	
systems	
have	
differed	
significantly	
in	
structure	
and	
content	
over	
the	
years	
.	

Development	
of	
DSM-5	
was	
ongoing	
during	
the	
development	
of	
this	
manual	
and	
an	
effort	
was	
undertaken	
to	
achieve	
the	
greatest	
degree	
of	
concordance	
possible	
between	
these	
two	
systems	
,	
recognizing	
that	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
will	
inevitably	
contain	
a	
greater	
level	
of	
detail	
than	
DSM	
due	
to	
differences	
in	
their	
target	
users	
.	

This	
goal	
was	
largely	
achieved	
although	
some	
differences	
will	
still	
exist	
.	

The	
major	
change	
to	
the	
Insomnia	
section	
(	
i.e.	
establishment	
of	
a	
single	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
diagnosis	
)	
within	
this	
new	
system	
is	
paralleled	
in	
DSM-5	
.	

Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	
diagnoses	
are	
organized	
somewhat	
differently	
in	
the	
DSM	
clas-	
sification	
than	
in	
this	
manual	
and	
narcolepsy	
criteria	
differ	
slightly	
.	

Circadian	
Rhythm	
Sleep	
-	
Wake	
Disorder	
diagnoses	
are	
identical	
within	
the	
two	
systems	
with	
the	
exception	
that	
DSM	
does	
not	
include	
a	
jet	
lag	
disorder	
.	

Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
are	
significantly	
more	
detailed	
within	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
than	
DSM-5	
,	
although	
the	
organizational	
structures	
in	
this	
section	
are	
quite	
similar	
.	

Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
and	
Parasomnias	
are	
likewise	
similar	
but	
with	
fewer	
overall	
diagnoses	
within	
DSM-5	
.	

With	
the	
publication	
of	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
,	
a	
major	
effort	
to	
expand	
and	
reorganize	
sleep	
related	
diagnoses	
within	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	
was	
undertaken	
.	

This	
effort	
resulted	
in	
the	
inclusion	
of	
many	
additional	
sleep	
related	
diag-	
noses	
in	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	
(	
primarily	
within	
the	
Diseases	
of	
the	
Nervous	
System	
section	
)	
.	

The	
archaic	
distinction	
between	
“	
organic	
”	
and	
“	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
non	
-	
organic	
”	
disorders	
has	
histori-	
cally	
been	
a	
guiding	
principle	
of	
ICD	
,	
resulting	
in	
dissemination	
of	
sleep	
diagnoses	
to	
both	
the	
neurological	
and	
mental	
disorder	
categories	
.	

Clinicians	
familiar	
with	
the	
ICD-	
9	
-	
CM	
categories	
which	
have	
been	
employed	
since	
the	
most	
recent	
changes	
will	
find	
general	
concordance	
between	
the	
assigned	
diagnostic	
codes	
found	
herein	
and	
the	
most	
current	
version	
of	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	
.	

These	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	
codes	
for	
sleep	
disorders	
are	
essen-	
tially	
carried	
over	
to	
ICD-10	
-	
CM	
.	

However	
,	
certain	
content	
revisions	
in	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
(	
e.g.	
,	
chronic	
insomnia	
)	
necessitates	
a	
significant	
departure	
from	
the	
coding	
approach	
utilized	
in	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	
and	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
.	

This	
is	
discussed	
further	
below	
.

diagnoses	
can	
be	
found	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
each	
diagnosis	
section	
of	
the	
book	
.	

In	
the	
United	
States	
,	
the	
former	
codes	
(	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	
)	
should	
be	
employed	
until	
the	
implementation	
date	
for	
ICD-10	
-	
CM	
which	
,	
at	
the	
time	
of	
this	
writing	
,	
is	
to	
be	
no	
sooner	
than	
October	
1	
,	
2015	
.	

Following	
that	
date	
,	
only	
the	
ICD-10	
-	
CM	
codes	
should	
be	
used	
.	

As	
already	
stated	
,	
clinicians	
should	
recognize	
that	
there	
is	
not	
precise	
concordance	
between	
the	
assigned	
codes	
for	
International	
Classification

Sleep

,	
3rd

diagnoses	
and	
the	
diagno-	
ses	
listed	
within	
ICD	
.	

Changes	
to	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
classification	
system	
are	
not	
reflected	
in	
the	
ICD	
system	
for	
many	
years	
.	

Moreover	
,	
the	
ICD	
classification	
of	
sleep	
disorders	
has	
historically	
been	
significantly	
less	
detailed	
than	
ICSD	
(	
particularly	
for	
international	
users	
not	
employing	
the	
Clinical	
Modification	
(	
CM	
)	
version	
used	
in	
the	
United	
States	
)	
.	

Hence	
,	
clinicians	
will	
find	
many	
areas	
in	
which	
assigned	
codes	
found	
in	
this	
manual	
do	
not	
correspond	
as	
closely	
as	
one	
would	
like	
to	
ICD	
codes	
.	

Most	
notably	
,	
with	
the	
collapse	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
diagnoses	
into	
a	
single	
disorder	
in	
International	
Classification	
of

the	
assigned

for	
this

”	

A	
variety	
of	
other	
insomnia	
diagnoses	
will	
continue	
to	
appear	
in	
the	
ICD

but	
,	
with	
the

recommended	
herein

these	
become	
essentially	
defunct	
for

clinicians	
.	

In	
summary	
,	
the

in	
this

represent	
“

to	
the

some

This	
section	
includes	
sleep	
disorders	
chiefly	
characterized	
by	
the	
complaint	
of	
insom-	
nia	
.	

For	
the	
purpose	
of	
this	
manual	
,	
insomnia	
is	
defined	
as	
a	
persistent	
difficulty	
with	
sleep	
initiation	
,	
duration	
,	
consolidation	
,	
or	
quality	
that	
occurs	
despite	
adequate	
opportunity	
and	
circumstances	
for	
sleep	
,	
and	
results	
in	
some	
form	
of	
daytime	
impair-	
ment	
.	

These	
three	
components	
of	
insomnia	
—	
persistent	
sleep	
difficulty	
,	
adequate	
sleep	
opportunity	
,	
and	
associated	
daytime	
dysfunction	
—	
are	
collectively	
implied	
by	
text	
references	
to	
the	
term	
insomnia	
.	

Among	
adults	
with	
insomnia	
,	
sleep	
complaints	
most	
typically	
include	
difficulties	
initiating	
or	
maintaining	
sleep	
.	

Concerns	
about	
lengthy	
periods	
of	
nocturnal	
wakefulness	
,	
insufficient	
amounts	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
or	
poor	
sleep	
quality	
often	
accompany	
these	
complaints	
.	

Individuals	
who	
report	
these	
sleep	
related	
symptoms	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
daytime	
impairment	
are	
not	
regarded	
as	
having	
an	
insomnia	
disorder	
that	
warrants	
clinical	
attention	
other	
than	
education	
and	
reassurance	
.	

Insomnia	
among	
children	ORGANISM
is	
often	
reported	
by	
their	
caretakers	
and	
char-	
acterized	
by	
bedtime	
resistance	
,	
frequent	
nighttime	
awakenings	
and/or	
an	
inability	
to	
sleep	
independently	
.	

Regardless	
of	
the	
exact	
nature	
of	
the	
nocturnal	
sleep	
concerns	
,	
daytime	
impairments	
are	
reported	
,	
presumably	
caused	
by	
the	
nighttime	
sleep	
diffi-	
culties	
or	
by	
some	
common	
but	
unidentified	
mechanism	
during	
sleep	
and	
wakeful-	
ness	
.	

Daytime	
symptoms	
typically	
include	
fatigue	
,	
decreased	
mood	
or	
irritability	
,	
general	
malaise	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
and	
cognitive	
impairment	
.	

Among	
adults	
,	
chronic	
insomnia	
may	
impair	
social	
or	
vocational	
functioning	
and	
reduce	
quality	
of	
life	
,	
whereas	
in	
chil-	
dren	
it	
may	
lead	
to	
poor	
school	
performance	
,	
impaired	
attention	
,	
and	
behavioral	
disturbance	
.	

In	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
physical	
symptoms	
such	
as	
muscle	ORGAN
tension	
,	
palpita-	
tions	
,	
or	
headache	
may	
also	
be	
attributed	
to	
the	
insomnia	
.	

Others	
with	
more	
severe	
forms	
of	
insomnia	
may	
be	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
motor	
vehicle	
and	
work	
-	
site	
acci-	
dents	
as	
well	
as	
psychiatric	
and	
cardiovascular	
disorders	
.	

Insomnia	
often	
accompa-	
nies	
comorbid	
medical	
illnesses	
,	
mental	
disorders	
,	
and	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

It	
may	
also	
arise	
in	
association	
with	
the	
use	
,	
abuse	
,	
or	
exposure	
to	
certain	
substances	
.	

When	
insomnia	
occurs	
comorbid	
to	
these	
conditions	
and	
is	
persistent	
and	
prominent	
,	
a	
sep-	
arate	
insomnia	
diagnosis	
is	
warranted	
.	

Insomnia	
The	
insomnia	
nosology	
presented	
in	
this	
text	
represents	
a	
marked	
departure	
from	
the	
previous	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
insomnia	
classification	
system	
in	
terms	
of	
its	
conceptual	
framework	
and	
relative	
simplicity	
.	

The	
previous	
insomnia	
nosology	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
promoted	
the	
concept	
that	
insomnia	
can	
exist	
as	
a	
primary	
sleep	
disorder	
or	
arise	
as	
a	
secondary	
form	
of	
sleep	
disturbance	
related	
to	
an	
underlying	
primary	
psychiatric	
,	
medical	
,	
or	
substance	
abuse	
disorder	
.	

However	
,	
many	
symptoms	
and	
associated	
fea-	
tures	
of	
so	
-	
called	
primary	
and	
secondary	
insomnias	
are	
overlapping	
,	
thus	
making	
differentiation	
among	
such	
subtypes	
difficult	
,	
if	
not	
impossible	
.	

There	
is	
increas-	
ing	
recognition	
that	
even	
when	
insomnia	
arises	
“	
secondary	
”	
to	
another	
condition	
,	
it	
often	
develops	
an	
independent	
course	
over	
time	
and	
may	
remain	
as	
a	
clinically	
significant	
condition	
,	
even	
if	
the	
so	
-	
called	
primary	
condition	
is	
adequately	
treated	
.	

Evidence	
suggests	
that	
insomnia	
,	
if	
left	
untreated	
,	
may	
adversely	
affect	
the	
outcome	
of	
these	
comorbid	
conditions	
.	

Moreover	
,	
it	
appears	
that	
treatment	
of	
the	
insomnia	
may	
improve	
outcome	
of	
both	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
and	
the	
comorbid	
conditions	
.	

Given	
these	
observations	
,	
insomnia	
seems	
best	
viewed	
as	
a	
comorbid	
disorder	
that	
warrants	
separate	
treatment	
attention	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
primary	
vs.	
secondary	
insomnia	
distinction	
,	
prior	
editions	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
delineated	
multiple	
putative	
“	
primary	
insomnia	
”	
diagnostic	
subtypes	
.	

Specifically	
,	
both	
the	
original	
1990	
version	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
and	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
described	
primary	
insomnia	
subtypes	
such	
as	
psycho-	
physiological	
insomnia	
,	
idiopathic	
insomnia	
,	
inadequate	
sleep	
hygiene	
,	
and	
paradox-	
ical	
insomnia	
,	
as	
discrete	
diagnostic	
entities	
.	

Experience	
suggests	
that	
,	
in	
practice	
,	
it	
is	
rare	
to	
encounter	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
meet	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
exclusively	
one	
of	
these	
subtypes	
.	

In	
fact	
,	
many	
of	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
delineated	
for	
these	
subtypes	
represent	
generic	
characteristics	
(	
e.g.	
,	
engaging	
in	
sleep	
-	
disruptive	
habits	
;	
underesti-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
mation

,	
evidence	
of

arousal	
)	
of	
insomnia	
,	
per	
se	
,	
and	
do	
not	
facilitate	
discrimination	
among	
these	
subtypes	
or	
between	
these	
subtypes	
and	
those	
presumed	
to	
have	
“	
secondary	
”	
forms	
of	
insomnia	
.	

Both	
clinical	
experience	
and	
a	
growing	
body	
of	
empirical	
findings	
have	
shown	
that	
the	
diagnostic	
distinctions	
advocated	
by	
previous	
versions	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
are	
difficult	
to	
reliably	
ascertain	
and	
are	
of	
question-	
able	
validity	
.	

In	
view	
of	
such	
considerations	
,	
the	
current	
manual	
abandons	
the	
previ-	
ously	
employed	
complex	
and	
highly	
specific	
insomnia	
classification	
scheme	
described	
by	
the	
original	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
and	
the	
2nd	
Edition	
in	
favor	
of	
a	
more	
global	
and	
defensible	
nosology	
.	

The	
manual	
includes	
three	
diagnostic	
categories	
for	
insomnia	
:	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
and	
other	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

These	
diag-	
noses	
apply	
to	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
and	
without	
comorbidities	
regardless	
of	
whether	
those	
comorbidities	
are	
viewed	
as	
potentially	
sleep	
disruptive	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
by	
chronic	
sleep	
onset	
and/or	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
with	
asso-	
ciated	
daytime	
impairment	
,	
and	
is	
reserved	
for	
individuals	
whose	
sleep	
difficulties	
exceed	
minimal	
frequency	
and	
duration	
thresholds	
shown	
to	
be	
associated	
with	
clin-	
ically	
significant	
morbidity	
outcomes	
.	

Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
by	
sleep	
/	
wake	
difficulties	
that	
fail	
to	
meet	
the	
minimal	
frequency	
and	
duration	
criteria	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
associated	
with	
clinically	
significant	
sleep	
dissatisfaction	
or	
waking	
impairment	
.	

Other	
insomnia	
disorders	
should	
be	
assigned	
to	
those	
rare	
cases	
that	
fail	
to	
meet	
criteria	
for	
short-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
yet	
are	
thought	
to	
have	
sufficient	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	
to	
warrant	
clinical	
attention	
.

The	
reported

can	
not	
be	
explained	
purely	
by	
inadequate	
opportunity	
(	
i.e.	
,	
enough	
time	
is	
allotted	
for	
sleep	
)	
or	
inadequate	
circumstances

Notes	
.	

Reports	
of	
difficulties	
initiating	
sleep	
,	
difficulties	
maintaining	
sleep	
,	
or	
waking	
up	
too	
early	
can	
be	
seen	
in	
all	
age	
groups	
.	

Resistance	
going	
to	
bed	
on	
an	
appropriate	
schedule	
and	
difficulty	
sleeping	
without	
parent	
or	
caregiver	
intervention	
is	
seen	
most	
commonly	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
older	
adults	
who	
require	
the	
supervision	
of	
a	
caretaker	
due	
to	
a	
significant	
level	
of	
functional	
impairment	
(	
e.g.	
,	
those	
with	
dementia	
)	
.	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
may	
show	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
sleep	
/	
wake	
difficulties	
lasting	
several	
weeks	
at	
a	
time	
over	
several	
years	
,	
yet	
not	
meet	
the	
three	
-	
month	
duration	
criterion	
for	
any	
single	
such	
episode	
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
should	
be	
assigned	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
given	
the	
persistence	
of	
their	
intermittent	
sleep	
difficulties	
over	
time	
.	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
use	
hypnotic	
medications	
regularly	
may	
sleep	
well	
and	
not	
meet	
the	
criteria	
for	
an	
insomnia	
disorder	
when	
they	
take	
such	
medications	
.	

However	
,	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
such	
medications	
these	
same	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
meet	
the	
above	
criteria	
.	

This	
diagnosis	
would	
apply	
to	
those	
patients	ORGANISM
particularly	
if	
they	
present	
clinically	
and	
voice	
concerns	
about	
their	
inability	
to	
sleep	
without	
their	
sleep	
medications	
.	
.	

Many	
comorbid	
conditions	
such	
as	
chronic	
pain	
disorders	
or	
gast-	
roesophageal	
reflux	
disease	
(	
GERD	
)	
may	
cause	
the	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaints	
delineated	
here	
.	

When	
such	
conditions	
are	
the	
sole	
cause	
of	
the	
sleep	
difficulty	
,	
a	
separate	
insomnia	
diagnosis	
may	
not	
apply	
.	

However	
,	
in	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
such	
conditions	
are	
chronic	
and	
are	
not	
the	
sole	
cause	
of	
sleep	
difficulty	
.	

Key	
determining	
factors	
in	
the	
decision	
to	
invoke	
a	
separate	
insomnia	
diagnosis	
include	
:	
“	
How	
much	
of	
the	
time	
does	
the	
sleep	
difficulty	
arise	
as	
a	
result	
of	
factors	
directly	
attributable	
to	
the	
comorbid	
condition	
(	
e.g.	
,	
pain	
or	
GERD	
)	
?	
”	

or	
“	
Are	
there	
times	
that	
the	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaints	
occur	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
these	
factors	
?	
”	

“	
Have	
perpetuating	
cognitive	
or	
behavioral	
factors	
(	
e.g.	
,	
negative	
expectations	
,	
conditioned	
arousal	
,	
sleep	
-	
disruptive	
habits	
)	
arisen	
,	
suggesting	
an	
autonomous	
aspect	
to	
the	
ongoing	
insomnia	
?	
”	

If	
there	
is	
evidence	
that	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
sleep/	
wake	
complaints	
are	
not	
solely	
caused	
by	
the	
medical	
condition	
,	
and	
those	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaints	
seem	
to	
merit	
separate	
treatment	
attention	
,	
then	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
should	
be	
made	
.	

Essential	
Features	
The	
essential	
feature	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
a	
frequent	
and	
persistent	
difficulty	
initiating	
or	
maintaining	
sleep	
that	
results	
in	
general	
sleep	
dissatisfaction	
.	

The	
sleep	
complaint	
is	
accompanied	
by	
distress	
about	
poor	
sleep	
and/or	
impairment	
in	
family	
,	
social	
,	
vocational	
,	
academic	
,	
or	
other	
important	
areas	
of	
functioning	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
and	
associated	
waking	
symptoms	
occur	
despite	
having	
adequate	
time	
and	
circumstances	
each	
night	
to	
obtain	
necessary	
sleep	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	
dis-	
order	
can	
occur	
in	
isolation	
or	
comorbidly	
with	
a	
mental	
disorder	
,	
medical	
condition	
,	
or	
substance	
use	
.	

The	
sleep	
complaints	
that	
comprise	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
may	
include	
difficul-	
ties	
initiating	
sleep	
or	
difficulties	
maintaining	
sleep	
.	

The	
latter	
complaint	
may	
include	
waking	
up	
during	
the	
night	
with	
difficulty	
returning	
to	
sleep	
or	
having	
a	
final	
awaken-	
ing	
occurring	
too	
early	
,	
well	
before	
the	
desired	
rising	
time	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
may	
be	
characterized	
solely	
by	
sleep	
onset	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
or	
,	
more	
commonly	
,	
by	
both	
types	
of	
complaints	
occurring	
together	
.	

Individuals	
’	
sleep	
com-	
plaints	
may	
also	
change	
over	
time	
such	
that	
those	
with	
solely	
sleep	
onset	
complaints	
may	
subsequently	
develop	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
and	
vice	
versa	
.	

Also	
,	
those	
who	
present	
initially	
with	
mixed	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sleep	
maintenance	
difficulties	
may	
later	
evidence	
one	
or	
the	
other	
of	
these	
difficulties	
but	
not	
both	
.	

Complaints	
about	
poor	
-	
quality	
,	
unrefreshing	
,	
or	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
often	
accompany	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
,	
but	
do	
not	
suffice	
to	
define	
insomnia	
disorder	
when	
occurring	
as	
the	
sole	
sleep	
complaint	
.	

The	
degree	
of	
sleep	
disturbance	
required	
to	
assign	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
diag-	

nosis	
is	
somewhat	
arbitrary	
in	
that	
it	
relies	
primarily	
on	
individuals	
’	
subjective	
sleep	
Insomnia	
Insomnia	
complaints	
.	

Moreover	
,	
the	
degree	
of	
sleep	
disturbance	
required	
to	
connote	
clinical	
significance	
varies	
across	
age	
groups	
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
sleep	
onset	
latencies	
and	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
after	
sleep	
onset	
>	
20	
minutes	
generally	
connote	
clinically	
significant	
sleep	
disturbances	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
young	
adults	
.	

In	
middle	
and	
older	
aged	
adults	
,	
onset	
latencies	
and	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
during	
sleep	
>	
30	
minutes	
typically	
connote	
clin-	
ical	
significance	
.	

Complaints	
of	
early	
morning	
awakening	
are	
less	
well	
defined	
,	
but	
typically	
entail	
the	
termination	
of	
sleep	
at	
least	
30	
minutes	
before	
the	
desired	
rising	
time	
and	
a	
concomitant	
reduced	
total	
sleep	
time	
compared	
with	
the	
usual	
premorbid	
sleep	
pattern	
.	

The	
exact	
time	
at	
which	
early	
morning	
awakenings	
occur	
may	
vary	
con-	
siderably	
as	
a	
function	
of	
usual	
bedtimes	
.	

For	
example	
,	
a	
final	
awakening	
at	
4:00	
a.m.	
is	
likely	
to	
connote	
clinical	
significance	
when	
the	
usual	
bedtime	
is	
11:00	
p.m.	

but	
not	
when	
the	
usual	
bedtime	
occurs	
at	
9:00	
p.m.	

Symptoms	
during	
wakefulness	
accompany	
the	
sleep	
difficulties	
and	
result	
in	
the	
impairment	
of	
normal	
functioning	
.	

Common	
waking	
symptoms	
include	
fatigue	
;	
reduced	
motivation	
;	
reduced	
concentration	
,	
attention	
,	
and	
memory	
functioning	
;	
and	
irritability	
or	
reduced	
mood	
.	

Complaints	
of	
subjective	
daytime	
sleepiness	
are	
also	
common	
,	
although	
,	
in	
contrast	
to	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
hypersomnolence	
conditions	
,	
many	
with	
this	
complaint	
are	
not	
able	
to	
nap	
in	
the	
daytime	
and	
few	
show	
unintentional	
sleep	
episodes	
.	

Reports	
of	
reduced	
performance	
at	
work	
or	
school	
or	
impaired	
social	
functioning	
also	
are	
common	
.	

Some	
affected	
individuals	
attribute	
errors	
or	
accidents	
at	
work	
to	
their	
sleep	
difficulties	
.	

Somatic	
symptoms	
such	
as	
headaches	
or	
gastrointes-	
tinal	
dysfunction	
are	
occasionally	
attributed	
to	
the	
ongoing	
sleep	
difficulties	
as	
well	
.	

The	
fatigue	
of	
insomnia	
sufferers	
is	
manifest	
mainly	
as	
a	
lack	
of	
energy	
and	
desire	
to	
reduce	
or	
limit	
activity	
levels	
.	

This	
symptom	
should	
be	
differentiated	
from	
reports	
of	
subjective	
sleepiness	
as	
well	
as	
from	
unintended	
sleep	
episodes	
.	

Insomnia	
sufferers	
commonly	
report	
subjective	
sleepiness	
characterized	
by	
a	
sense	
of	
reduced	
alertness	
and	
enhanced	
need	
or	
desire	
to	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
they	
seldom	
fall	
asleep	
spontaneously	
without	
intending	
to	
do	
so	
.	

Despite	
a	
desire	
to	
nap	
,	
many	
individuals	
with	
insomnia	
are	
unable	
to	
do	
so	
.	

Frequent	
,	
unintentional	
daytime	
sleep	
episodes	
are	
more	
characteristic	
of	
other	
types	
of	
sleep	
disorders	
such	
as	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
,	
narcolepsy	
,	
idio-	
pathic	
hypersomnia	
,	
and	
the	
like	
.	

In	
young	
children	ORGANISM
,	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
,	
staying	
asleep	
,	
or	
both	
are	
often	
the	
result	
of	
inappropriate	
sleep	
associations	
or	
inadequate	
limit	
setting	
.	

Inappropriate	
sleep	
associ-	

ations	
result	
from	
a	
child	
’s	
dependency	
on	
specific	
stimulation	
,	
objects	
,	
or	
settings	
for	
initiating	
sleep	
or	
returning	
to	
sleep	
following	
an	
awakening	
;	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
these	
conditions	
,	
sleep	
onset	
is	
significantly	
delayed	
.	

This	
manifestation	
usually	
presents	
as	
frequent	
nighttime	
awakenings	
and/or	
nighttime	
fears	
or	
anxiety	
about	
sleeping	
alone	
.	

The	
process	
of	
falling	
asleep	
is	
associated	
with	
a	
specific	
form	
of	
stimulation	
(	
e.g.	
,	
rocking	
,	
watching	
television	
)	
,	
object	
(	
e.g.	
,	
bottle	
,	
excessive	
feedings	
)	
,	
or	
setting	
(	
e.g.	
,	
lighted	
room	
,	
parents	
remaining	
in	
the	
room	
,	
or	
child	
taken	
to	
parents	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
’	
bed	
)	
.	

When	
such	
conditions	
are	
absent	
,	
children	ORGANISM
with	
this	
disorder	
experience	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
bedtime	
and	
following	
normal	
nighttime	
arousals	
.	

If	
the	
conditions	
associ-	
ated	
with	
falling	
asleep	
are	
reestablished	
,	
the	
child	
usually	
resumes	
sleep	
relatively	
quickly	
.	

Because	
sleep	
-	
onset	
associations	
are	
highly	
prevalent	
in	
young	
children	ORGANISM
,	
the	
phenomenon	
is	
defined	
as	
a	
disorder	
only	
if	
(	
1	
)	
the	
associations	
are	
highly	
problem-	
atic	
or	
demanding	
(	
e.g.	
,	
extended	
rocking	
,	
car	
rides	
)	
;	
(	
2	
)	
sleep	
onset	
is	
significantly	
delayed	
or	
sleep	
is	
otherwise	
disrupted	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
the	
associated	
conditions	
;	
and	
(

)	
caregiver	
intervention	
is	
frequently	
required	
to	
aid	
the	
onset	
or	
resumption	
of	
sleep	
.	

Limit

issues	
are	
characterized	
by	
bedtime	
stalling	
or	
bedtime	
refusal	
that	
is	
met	
with	
and	
reinforced	
by	
inadequate	
limit	
setting	
by	
a	
caregiver	
.	

Sleep	
problems	
occur	
when	
caregivers	
institute	
no	
or	
few	
limits	
or	
when	
limits	
are	
instituted	
inconsistently

awakenings	
,	
depending	
on	
caregiver	
response	
during	
the	
night	
.	

It	
also	
should	
be	
noted	
that	
some	
children	ORGANISM
’s	
needs	
for	
specific	
conditions	
for	
sleeping	
or	
their	
resistance	
to	
go	
to	
bed	
may	
reflect	
underlying	
anxiety	
or	
fears	
.	

Fear	
of	
sleep-	
ing	
alone	
,	
being	
in	
the	
dark	
,	
or	
having	
nightmares	
may	
lead	
some	
children	ORGANISM
to	
demand	
certain	
sleep	
promoting	
conditions	
(	
presence	
of	
parent	
in	
bedroom	
)	
or	
to	
repeatedly	
delay	
their	
bedtimes	
.	

Although	
transient	
and	
episodic	
forms	
of	
insomnia	
occur	
,	
the	
clinically	
significant	
daytime	
consequences	
of	
insomnia	
and	
the	
longer	
term	
,	
more	
serious	
morbidity	
out-	
comes	
most	
typically	
develop	
when	
the	
sleep	
difficulties	
occur	
at	
least	
three	
times	
per	
week	
and	
persist	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
.	

For	
this	
reason	
,	
these	
frequency	
and	
dura-	
tion	
criteria	
must	
be	
met	
for	
the	
assignment	
of	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
diagnosis	
.	

However	
,	
it	
is	
recognized	
that	
more	
acute	
and	
episodic	
forms	
of	
insomnia	
may	
cause	
significant	
distress	
and	
functional	
impairment	
and	
require	
clinical	
attention	
.	

Cases	
that	
meet	
all	
criteria	
except	
the	
frequency	
or	
duration	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
should	
be	
assigned	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
short

Associated	
Features	
Individuals	
with	
chronic

typically	
note	
feelings

In

excessive	
focus

about

and	
their	
associated	
daytime	
consequences	
are	
common	
.	

Thoughts

Frank

anxiety	
about	
sleep	
is	
common	
.	

Although	
many	
with	
insomnia	
may	
appear	
anxious	
and	
worry	
-	
prone	
,	
their	
anxiety	
and	
worry	
are	
often	
focused	
mainly	
on	
their	
sleep	
difficulties	
.	

When	
anxiety	
and	
worry	
are	
more	
pervasive	
and	
not	
solely	
focused	
on	
sleep	
problems	
,	
a	
comorbid	
anxiety	
disorder	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Many	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
show	
a	
pattern	
of	
conditioned	
arousal	
in	
response	
to	
envi-	
ronmental	
cues	
in	
their	
bedrooms	
or	
conscious	
efforts	
to	
initiate	
sleep	
.	

Such	
individuals	
may	
fall	
asleep	
easily	
in	
settings	
outside	
of	
their	
bedrooms	
when	
not	
trying	
to	
sleep	
,	
but	
show	
a	
pattern	
of	
cognitive	
and	
physiological	
arousal	
when	
lying	
down	
in	
their	
beds	
with	
the	
intention	
to	
fall	
asleep	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
this	
pattern	
may	
report	
sleeping	
better	
when	
away	
from	
home	
than	
when	
at	
home	
.	

Unlike	
noncomplaining	
normal	
sleepers	
,	
indi-	
viduals	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
often	
express	
conscious	
intentions	
and	
excessive	
effort	
to	
sleep	
,	
only	
to	
find	
sleep	
difficult	
to	
initiate	
under	
such	
circumstances	
.	

In	
children	ORGANISM
,	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
may	
be	
accompanied	
by	
daytime	
behavioral	
prob-	
lems	
and	
limit

setting	
difficulties	
during	
the	
day	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
nighttime	
sleep	
distur-	
bance	
often	
results	
in	
poor	
parental	
sleep	
and	
associated	
daytime	
impairment	
.	

Marital	
conflicts	
regarding	
how	
to	
respond	
to	
or	
intervene	
with	
the	
ongoing	
sleep	
problem	
may	
arise

Parents	
also	
may	
develop	
negative	
feelings	
toward	
the

disrupts	
their

subtypes	
are

The	
specific	
primary	
insomnia	
subtypes	
listed	
in	
the	
previous	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
include	
the	
following	
:	
Psychophysiological	
insomnia	
is	
characterized	
primarily	
by	
heightened	
arousal	
and	
learned	
sleep	
-	
preventing	
associations	
that	
result	
in	
a	
complaint	
of	
insomnia	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
presumed	
to	
have	
this	
type	
of	
insomnia	
often	
have	
sleep	
difficulty	
when	
trying	
to	
sleep	
in	
their	
usual	
sleep	
setting	
at	
home	
but	
may	
fall	
asleep	
easily	
in	
a	
novel	
sleep	
setting	
or	
when	
not	
trying	
to	
sleep	
.	

They	
also	
demonstrate	
excessive	
focus	
on	
and	
worry	
about	
sleep	
and	
suffer	
from	
elevated	
levels	
of	
cognitive	
and	
somatic	
arousal	
,	
particularly	
at	
bedtime	
.	

Idiopathic	
insomnia	
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
longstanding	
complaint	
of	
sleep	
difficulties	
with	
insidious	
onset	
occurring	
during	
infancy	
or	
early	
childhood	
.	

It	
is	
presumed	
to	
arise	
in	
infancy	
or	
early	
childhood	
without	
discernible	
cause	
and	
to	
persist	
over	
time	
without	
sustained	
periods	
of	
remission	
.	

Given	
its	
early	
onset	
,	
stability	
over	
time	
,	
and	
lifelong	
course	
,	
this	
disorder	
is	
thought	
to	
arise	
from	
either	
genetically	
determined	
or	
congenital	
aberrations	
in	
the	
sleep	
-	
inducing	
or	
arousal	
systems	
in	
the	
brain	ORGAN
,	
or	
both	
.	

No	
consistent	
genetic	
markers	
or	
neural	
pathology	
have	
been	
identified	
among	
those	
presumed	
to	
suffer	
from	
this	
condition	
.	

Paradoxical	
insomnia	
,	
which	
has	
previously	
been	
called	
sleep	
state	
misperception	
,	
is	
described	
as	
a	
complaint	
of	
severe	
sleep	
disturbance	
without	
corroborative	
objective	
evidence	
of	
the	
degree	
of	
sleep	
disturbance	
claimed	
.	

Those	
presumed	
to	
have	
this	
form	
of	
sleep	
difficulty	
have	
a	
marked	
propensity	
to	
underestimate	
the	
amount	
of	
sleep	
they	
actually	
are	
obtaining	
.	

In	
essence	
,	
they	
are	
thought	
to	
perceive	
much	
of	
the	
time	
they	
actually	
sleep	
as	
wakefulness	
.	

Although	
many	
such	
patients	ORGANISM
routinely	
obtain	
norma-	
tive	
amounts	
of	
sleep	
,	
as	
documented	
by	
standard	
polysomnographic	
measures	
,	
they	
complain	
of	
the	
common	
sleep	
/	
wake	
symptoms	
of	
other	
insomnia	
disorders	
.	

Some	
studies	
using	
neuroimaging	
or	
sleep	
electroencephalograph	
(	
EEG	
)	
spectral	
analysis	
techniques	
have	
suggested	
that	
an	
altered	
sleep	
/	
wake	
arousal	
system	
in	
such	
individ-	
uals	
may	
explain	
the	
apparent	
mismatch	
between	
their	
conventional	
objective	
sleep	
measures	
and	
subjective	
sleep	
reports	
.	

Inadequate	
sleep	
hygiene	
is	
presumed	
to	
result	
from	
or	
be	
sustained	
by	
daily	
living	
activities	
that	
are	
inconsistent	
with	
the	
maintenance	
of	
good	
-	
quality	
sleep	
and	
normal	
daytime	
alertness	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
this	
form	
of	
insomnia	
have	
ongoing	
sleep/	
wake	
difficulties	
as	
a	
function	
of	
practices	
such	
as	
daytime	
napping	
,	
maintaining	
a	
highly	
variable	
sleep	
/	
wake	
schedule	
,	
routinely	
using	
sleep	
-	
disruptive	
products	
(	
caf-	
feine	
,	
tobacco	ORGANISM
,	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
)	
too	
close	
to	
bedtime	
,	
engaging	
in	
mentally	
or	
physically	
acti-	
vating	
or	
emotionally	
upsetting	
activities	
too	
close	
to	
bedtime	
,	
routinely	
using	
the	
bed	
and	
bedroom	
for	
activities	
other	
than	
sleep	
,	
or	
failing	
to	
maintain	
a	
comfortable	
environment	
for	
sleep	
.	

Behavioral	
insomnia	
of	
childhood	
is	
presumed	
to	
result	
from	
improper	
sleep	
train-	
ing	
or	
limit	
setting	
by	
parents	
or	
caretakers	
.	

Within	
this	
broader	
diagnosis	
,	
several	
subtypes	
have	
been	
described	
.	

Sleep	
-	
onset	
association	
type	
is	
characterized	
by	
the	
child	
’s	
dependency	
on	
specific	
stimulation	
,	
objects	
,	
or	
settings	
for	
initiating	
sleep	
or	
returning	
to	
sleep	
following	
an	
awakening	
;	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
these	
conditions	
,	
sleep	
onset	
is	
significantly	
delayed	
.	

Limit	
-	
setting	
type	
is	
characterized	
by	
bedtime	
stalling	
or	
bedtime	
refusal	
that	
is	
the	
result	
of	
inadequate	
limit	
setting	
by	
a	
caregiver	
.

Insomnia	
Insomnia	
characterized	
by	
features

subtype	
within	
this	
diagnostic	
category	
.	

The	
DSM	
-	
IV	
-	
TR	
and	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
also	
describe	
several	
so	
-	
called	
secondary	
insomnias	
,	
arising	
from	
co	
-	
occurring	
primary	
or	
causative	
conditions	
.	

Among	
these	
are	
the	
following	
:	
Insomnia	
due	
to

another	
)	
mental	
disorder	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
caused	
by	
or	
secondary	
to	
a

psychiatric	
condition

Insomnia	
is	
a	
common	
complaint	
,	
particularly	
among	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
mood	
disorders	
and	
anxiety	
disorders	
.	

Likewise	
,	
sleep	
distur-	
bance	
is	
commonly	
seen	
in	
those	
with	
psychotic	
spectrum

and	
various

.	

Among	
those	
individuals	
presumed	
to	
have	
insomnia	
due	
to	
a	
mental	
disorder	
,	
insomnia	
has	
historically	
been	
regarded	
as	
a	
secondary	
symptom	
,	
caused	
by	
the	
mental	
disorder	
itself	
.	

Insomnia	
due	
to	
(	
a

medical	
condition	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
caused	
by	
or	
secondary	
to	
a	
co	
-	
occurring	
medical	
condition	
.	

Like	
the	
mental	
disorders	
,	
many	
medical	
condi-	
tions	
may	
have	
an	
ongoing	
insomnia	
complaint	
associated	
with	
them	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
those	
conditions	
that	
cause	
some	
form	
of	
ongoing	
pain	
or	
discomfort	
,	
mobility	
lim-	
itation	
,	
or	
breathing	
disturbance	
commonly	
have	
insomnia	
complaints	
accompanying	
them	
.	

Among	
those	
individuals	
presumed	
to	
have	
insomnia	
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disor-	
der	
,	
insomnia	
has	
historically	
been	
regarded	
as	
a	
secondary	
symptom	
,	
caused	
by	
the	
medical	
disorder	
itself	
.	

Insomnia	
due	
to	
drug	
or	
substance	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
caused	
by	
or	
secondary	
to	
use	
of	
or	
withdrawal	
from	
a	
drug	
or	
substance	
.	

Many	
forms	
of	
prescription	
and	
nonprescrip-	
tion	
medications	
,	
street	
drugs	
,	
and	
other	
commonly	
used	
substances	
may	
produce	
sleep	
disturbances	
either	
during	
periods	
of	
use	
or	
upon	
withdrawal	
.	

Given	
these	
effects	
,	
insomnia	
complaints	
may	
arise	
either	
during	
periods	
when	
these	
substances	
are	
used	
or	
following	
their	
discontinuance	
.	

Among	
those	
individuals	
presumed	
to	
have	
insom-	
nia	
due	
to	
drug	
or	
substance	
,	
insomnia	
has	
historically	
been	
regarded	
as	
a	
secondary	
symptom	
,	
caused	
by	
the	
drug	
or	
substance	
itself	
.	

Despite	
the	
heuristic	
appeal	
of	
these	
various	
subtypes	
,	
it	
is	
often	
difficult	
to	
discrim-	
inate	
among	
them	
in	
clinical	
practice	
.	

Many	
of	
the	
defining	
features	
of	
the	
so	
-	
called	
primary	
insomnia	
subtypes	
such	
as	
conditioned	
arousal	
,	
poor	
sleep	
hygiene	
prac-	
tices	
,	
and	
underestimation	
of	
sleep	
time	
are	
ubiquitous	
among	
insomnia	
sufferers	
,	
per	
se	
,	
and	
are	
not	
specific	
to	
one	
subgroup	
.	

This	
is	
true	
whether	
the	
so	
-	
called	
primary	
insomnia	
subtypes	
are	
considered	
in	
isolation	
or	
if	
all	
of	
the	
primary	
and	
secondary	
subtypes	
mentioned	
are	
considered	
.	

There	
is	
substantial	
symptom	
overlap	
both	
within	
the	
group	
of	
primary	
insomnias	
as	
well	
as	
among	
the	
primary	
and	
secondary	
insomnias	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
many	
individuals	
with	
insomnia	
have	
mul-	
tiple	
medical	
and	
psychiatric	
comorbidities	
,	
making	
it	
difficult	
to	
assign	
causation	
to	
any	
single	
factor	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
discrimination	
among	
these	
subtypes	
has	
proven	
difficult	
given	
their	
current	
definitions	
and	
available	
methods	
for	
their	
ascertain-	
ment	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
it	
is	
not	
clear	
that	
insomnia	
is	
always	
the	
result	
of	
co	
-	
occur-	ORGAN
ring	
medical	
,	
mental	
,	
or	
substance	
use	
disorders	
.	

Often	
insomnia	
may	
precede	
the	
onset	
of	
such	
conditions	
,	
and	
even	
when	
precipitated	
by	
such	
conditions	
,	
the	
insom-	
nia	
may	
evolve	
and	
develop	
partial	
or	
total	
independence	
over	
time	
.	

In	
such	
cir-	
cumstances	
,	
the	
term	
secondary	
insomnia	
seems	
inappropriate	
.	

Currently	
there	
is	
limited	
understanding	
of	
mechanistic	
pathways	
in	
chronic	
insomnia	
,	
so	
it	
is	
not	
possible	
to	
draw	
firm	
conclusions	
about	
the	
association	
or	
direction	
of	
causality	
between	
insomnia	
and	
such	
co	
-	
occurring	
conditions	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
other	
than	
the	
differing	
treatments	
required	
for	
distinctive	
comorbidities	
,	
efficacious	
treatments	
for	
insomnia	
generally	
are	
similar	
across	
the	
range	
of	
insomnia	
subtypes	
.	

Finally	
,	
research	
has	
provided	
very	
limited	
support	
for	
the	
reliability	
and	
validity	
of	
the	
various	
specific	
subtypes	
discussed	
.	

International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
additionally	
delineates	
the	
separate	
pediatric	
diagnosis	
,	
behavioral	
insomnia	
of	
childhood	
,	
characterized	
by	
sleep	
difficulties	
resulting	
from	
inappropriate	
sleep	
associations	
or	
inadequate	
limit	
setting	
by	
parents	
or	
caretakers	
.	

Although	
perhaps	
more	
common	
in	
young	
children	ORGANISM
,	
inappropriate	
sleep	
associations	
can	
occur	
in	
older	
age	
groups	
.	

For	
example	
,	
adults	
with	
insomnia	
may	
report	
intolerance	
for	
quiet

dark

and	
may	
not	
be	
able	
to	
fall

unless	
the

is

Similarly	
,	
it	
is	
not	
clear	
that	
limit

are	
involved	
in	
the

difficulties	
of	
only	
young	
children	ORGANISM
.	

Such	
difficulties	
also	
can	
manifest	
during	
adolescence	
as	
a	
function	
of	
volitionally	
delaying	
bedtimes	
.	

Similarly	
,	
they	
may	
occur	
in	
older	
,	
cognitively	
impaired	
adults	
when	
their	
caretak-	
ers	
allow	
liberal	
daytime	
napping	
that	
in	
turn	
results	
in	
disruptive	
awakenings	
and	
night	
wandering	
.	

It	
is	
also	
clear	
that	
many	
of	
the	
features	
of	
sleep	
/	
wake	
dysfunc-	
tion	
assigned	
to	
this	
childhood	
insomnia	
subtype	
overlap	
substantially	
with	
the	
global	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Given	
these	
considerations	
,	
a	
separate	
childhood	
insomnia	
diagno-	
sis	
is	
of	
questionable	
merit	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
these	
various	
subtypes	
,	
a	
distinctive	
subtype	
of	
insomnia	
with	
objectively	
short	
sleep	
duration	
has	
been	
recently	
described	
.	

This	
group	
is	
characterized	
by	
insom-	
nia	
complaints	
,	
along	
with	
an	
objectively	
documented	
average	
sleep	
time	
less	
than	
six	
hours	
per

and	
elevated	
morbidity

Because	
evidence

Insomnia	
Insomnia	
insomnia	
is	
currently	
limited	
,	
it	
is	
premature	
to	
delineate	
a	
separate	
insomnia	
category	
for	
this	
presentation	
at	
this	
juncture	
.	

Given	
all	
of	
these	
considerations	
,	
a	
more	
global	
and	
defensible	
approach	
has	
been	
chosen	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
those	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
complaints	
.	

Specifically	
,	
the	
single	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
provided	
for	
all	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
have	
per-	
sistent	
and	
frequent	
insomnia	
complaints	
whether	
they	
occur	
in	
the	
presence	
or	
absence	
of

Demographics	
The	
full	
clinical	
syndrome	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
occurs	
in	
about	
10	
%	
of	
the	
population	
,	
but	
the	
prevalence	
of	
transient	
insomnia	
symptoms	
is	
much	
higher	
(	
30	
%	
to	
35	
%	
of	
the	
population	
)	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
more	
common	
in	
women	ORGANISM
,	
those	
with	
medical	
/	
psychiatric	
/	
substance	
disorders	
,	
and	
in	
people	ORGANISM
in	
lower	
socioeco-	
nomic	
strata	
.	

It	
may	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
but	
is	
more	
commonly	
diagnosed	
in	
older	
adults	
,	
most	
likely	
due	
to	
age	
-	
related	
deterioration	
in	
sleep	
continuity	
and	
increase	
in	
medical	
comorbidities	
and	
medication	
use	
that	
increase	
insomnia	
risk	
.	

Insomnia	
associated	
with	
requirements	
of	
parental	
/	
caregiver	
presence	
at	
bedtime	
and/or	
during	
the	
night	
,	
along	
with	
insomnia	
due	
to	
limit

difficulties	
,	
are	
estimated	
to	
occur	
in	
10	
%	
to	
30	
%	
of	
children	ORGANISM
,	
depending	
on	
the	
exact	
definitions	
used	
.	

Certain	
subgroups	
of	
children	ORGANISM
,	
such	
as	
those	
suffering	
from	
chronic	
illnesses	
or	
neurodevelopmental	
disorders	
,	
have	
a	
somewhat	
higher	
prevalence	
of	
insomnia	
symptoms	
.	

Because	
children	ORGANISM
are	
not	
expected	
to	
sleep	
through	
the	
night	
with	
reg-	
ularity	
until	
they	
are	
three	
to	
six	
months	
of	
age	
,	
six	
months	
is	
a	
reasonable	
age	
to	
first	
consider	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
unless	
the	
sleeplessness	
is	
very	
marked	
at	
an	
earlier	
age	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
sleep

onset	
associations	
and	
limit

problems	
are	
strongly	
associated	
with	
caregivers	
’	
behaviors	
,	
bedtime	
interac-	
tions	
,	
and	
culture	
.	

Thus	
,	
the	
interpretation	
of	
the	
nighttime	
awakenings	
and	
demands	
for	
parental	
contact	
should	
be	
considered	
in	
the	
context	
of	
the	
family	
and	
culture	
.	

Identification	
of	
sleep	
problems	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adolescents	
are	
often	
based	
on	
spe-	
cific	
cultural	
definitions	
.	

Studies	
on	
adolescents	
indicate	
prevalence	
rates	
of	
3	
%	
to	
12	
%	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
utilized	
,	
with	
higher	
frequency	
in	
girls	
than	
boys	
after	
puberty

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Individuals	
who	
have	
difficulty	
sleeping	
during	
stressful	
times	
or	
who	
report	
being	
habitual	
light	
sleepers	
appear	
to	
have	
elevated	
propensity	
to	
develop	
chronic	
insomnia	
.	

Prior	
transient	
episodes	
of	
poor	
sleep	
elevate	
the	
risk	
for	
subsequent	
development	
of	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Job

stress	
and

in

are	
often	
precipitating

Personality

produce	
anxious

,	
general	
well	
-	
being	
,	
or	
daytime	
func-	
tioning	
may	
serve	
as	
predisposing	
characteristics	
because	
individuals	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
often	
display	
excessive	
preoccupation	
with	
daytime	
consequences	
of	
insomnia	
,	
and	
they	
devote	
particular	
effort	
to	
what	
they	
presume	
are

promot-	
ing	
practices	
.	

A	
psychological	
style	
characterized	
by	
the	
repression	
and	
internalization	
of	
disturbing	
affect	
is	
characteristic	
of	
those	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
and	
also	
may	
represent	
a	
predisposing	
trait	
.	

Parents	
who	
have	
unrealistic	
sleep	
expectations	
for	
their	
children	ORGANISM
may	
predispose	
them	
to	
insomnia	
by	
putting	
them	
in	
bed	
too	
early	
or	
assigning	
them	
too	
much	
time	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
.	

Comorbid	
psychiatric	
conditions	
,	
particularly	
mood	
and	
anxiety

are	
asso-

Insomnia	
in

often	
associated	
with	
difficult	
temperament

as	
well	
as

comorbid	
medical

Unstable

are	
likewise	
significant	
risk	
factors	
in	
both	
children	ORGANISM
and

Caregiver	
and	
relationship	
factors	
are	
also	
important	
to	
consider	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
parents	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
a	
current	
or	
past	
history	
of	
medical	
problems	
may	
have	
dif-	
ficulty

whether	
because	
of	
guilt

a	
sense	
that	
the	
child	
is	
“

”	
or	
concerns	
about	
doing	
psychological	
harm	
.	

Environmental	
factors	
such	
as	
the	
child	
sharing	
a

the	
presence	
of	
extended	
family

Complications	
Onset	
may	
be	
insidious	
or	
acute

In	
the	
former	
case	
,	
individuals	
often	
report	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	
in	
early	
life	
or	
young	
adulthood	
.	

Onset	
of	
insomnia	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
major	
life	
events	
(	
e.g.	
,	
separation	
,	
death	
of	
a	
loved	
one	
)	
,	
minor	
daily	
stressors	
,	
or	
changes	
in	
sleep	
schedule	
.	

The	
course	
of	
insomnia	
can	
be	
situational	
,	
recurrent	
,	
or	
persistent	
.	

The	
specific	
type	
of	
sleep	
complaint	
may	
also	
change	
over	
time	
.	

Individuals	
who	
complain	
of	
diffi-	
culty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
one	
time	
may	
later	
complain	
of	
difficulty	
maintaining	
sleep	
,	
and	
vice	
versa	
.	

Although	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
often	
remits	
when	
the	
precipitating	
event	
subsides	
or	
the	
individual	
adapts	
to	
it	
,	
sleep	
difficulties	
may	
also	
persist	
over	
time	
even	
after	
the	
initial	
triggering	
factor	
has	
disappeared	
.	

When	
left	
untreated	
,	
insomnia	
may	
persist	
and	
gradually	
lead	
to	
a	
vicious	
cycle	
of	
poor	
sleep	
,	
daytime	
impairments	
,	
apprehension	
of	
insomnia	
,	
and	
further	
sleep	
disturbances	
.	

Among	
predisposed	
individ-

,	
insomnia	
can	
also	
follow	
an	
intermittent	
course

with	
recurrent	
episodes	
of

associated	
with	
stressful	
life

Approximately	
70	
%	
of	
individuals	
with	
insomnia	
at	
a	
given	
time	
continue	
reporting	
insomnia	
a	
year	
later	
,	
and	
50	
%	
still	
have	
insomnia	
three	
years	
later	
.	

Complications	
of	
persistent	
insomnia	
include	
increased	
risks	
for	
depression

Among	
children	ORGANISM

chronic

may	
have	
its	
onset	
at	
any	
time	
during	
late	
infancy	
through	
the	
childhood	
years	
.	

The	
course	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
in	
young	
children	ORGANISM
varies	
and	
depends	
on	
the	
reasons	
for	
the	
sleeplessness	
.	

When	
limit

setting	
factors	
and	
negative	
sleep	
associations	
resolve	
,	
sleep	
often	
improves	
.	

With	
age	
,	
inde-	
pendence	
and	
privacy	
become	
more	
important	
,	
and	
sleep	
difficulties	
may	
decrease	
.	

Complications	
may	
result	
from	
the	
consequent	
sleep	
loss	
and	
include	
irritability	
and	
decreased	
attention	
and	
school	
performance	
.	

Increased	
family	
tensions	
and	
caregiver	
sleep	
loss	
may	
also	
result	
.	

Some	
who	
develop	
insomnia	
during	
childhood	
may	
con-

suffer	
from	
chronic

issues	
during	
childhood

such

Because	
children	ORGANISM
are	
not	
expected	
to	
sleep	
through	
the	
night	
with	
regularity	
until	
they	
are	
three	
to	
six	
months	
of	
age	
,	
six	
months	
is	
a	
reasonable	
age	
to	
first	
consider	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
unless	
the	
sleeplessness	
is	
very	
marked	
at	
an	
earlier	
age	
.	

However	
,	
when	
sleep	
difficulties	
are	
persistent	
and	
pronounced	
in	
infants	
,	
underlying	
medical	
causes	
should	
be	
considered	
(	
e.g.	
,	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
,	
GERD	ORGANISM
,	
pain	
)	
.	

The	
specific	
symptoms	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
as	
well	
as	
precipitating	
and	
per-	
petuating	
factors	
,	
may	
vary	
across	
the	
adult	
age	
range	
.	

These	
changes	
may	
in	
part	
reflect	
developmental	
changes	
across	
adulthood	
,	
such	
as	
the	
phase	
delay	
of	
endoge-	
nous	
circadian	
rhythms	
in	
adolescence	
and	
young	
adulthood	
,	
and	
the	
phase	
advance	
and	
increased	
number	
of	
awakenings	
often	
seen	
even	
among	
healthy	
older	
adults	
.	

Epidemiological	
studies	
confirm	
that	
sleep	
onset	
difficulties	
and	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
are	
most	
common	
among	
young	
adults	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
whereas	
sleep	
maintenance	
insomnia	
and	
early	
morning	
awakening	
are	
more	
common	
in	
middle

aged	
and	
older	
adults	
.	

Objective	
daytime	
sleepiness	
is	
uncommon	
in	
younger	
adults	
with	
insomnia	
,	
but	
more	
common	
in	
older	
adults	
.	

However	
,	
older	
adults	
may	
have	
less	
sleep	
dissatisfaction	
than	
their	
younger	
counterparts	
,	
despite	
objectively	
worse	
sleep	
continuity	
.	

Precipitating	
factors	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
may	
also	
change	
across	
the	
adult	
age	
range	
,	
with	
medical	
and	
medication	
factors	
assuming	
a	
larger	
role	
in	
older	
adults	
.	

Likewise	
,	
perpetuating	
factors	
may	
vary	
with	
the	
life	
circumstances	
of	
adults	
of	
different	
ages	
.	

One	
common	
example	
is	
the	
option	
of	
older	
adults	
to	
spend	
large	
amounts	
of	
time	
in	
bed	
after	
retirement	
,	
which	
may	
exacerbate	
the	
effects	
of	
age	
on	
sleep	
continuity	
.	

Finally	
,	
medical	
disorders	
and	
symptoms	
(	
e.g.	
,	
pain	
,	
dyspnea	
,	
and	
impaired	
mobility	
)	
and	
medications	
often	
play	
a	
larger

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Studies	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
chronic

have	
focused	
on	
one	
or	
more	
dimensions	
of	
physiological	
hyperarousal	
during	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

These	
studies	
contrast	
groups	
of	
insomnia	
sufferers	
,	
typically	
those	
without

nificant	
comorbidities	
,	
with	
healthy	
controls	
using	
a

Many	
of	
these	
studies	
are	
characterized	
by	
small

Collectively	
these

Objective	
Findings	

Although	
polysomnography	
is	
not	
indicated	
in	
the	
routine	
evaluation	
of	
insomnia	
,	
it	
may	
be	
useful	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
(	
e.g.	
,	
sleep	
-	
disordered	
breathing	
)	
among	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
appear	
to	
meet	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

In	
the	
absence	
of	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
results	
of	
polysomnographic	
sleep	
monitoring	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
chronic	
insomnia

may	
show	
increased	
sleep

and/or	
increased

coupled	
with	
reduced

Sleep

although	
one

hour	
to	
two

periods	
of	
wakefulness	
in

are	
not	
uncommon	
.	

A	
subset	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
shows	
reduced	
sleep	
duration	
of	
less	
than	
six	
hours	
per	
night	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
show	
altered	
sleep	
architecture	
with	
an	
increase	
in	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
and	
a	
decrease	
in	
slow

sleep	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
pronounced	
condi-	
tioned	
sleep	
difficulty	
in	
the	
home	
environment	
may	
show	
a	
reverse

effect	
in	
the

(	
i.e.	
,	
better	
sleep	
on	
the

the	
second

)	
.	

However	
,	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
show	
normal	
sleep	
times	
and	
an	
absence	
of	
sleep	
onset	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
difficulties	
on	
standard	
polysomnographic	
(	
PSG	
)	
measures	
.	

Some	
insomnia	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
alterations	
in	
power	
density	
measures	
of	
the	
sleep	
EEG	
when	
compared	
with	
individuals	
without	
sleep	
complaints	
.	

Specifically	
,	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
often	
show	
relatively	
greater	
power	
in	
the	
high	
frequency	
(	
beta	
and	
gamma

band-	
widths	
.	

Some	
reports	
have	
shown	
that

is	
characteris-

of

compared	
to

patients	ORGANISM
with	
more	
obvious	
objective	
sleep	
disturbances	
or	
individuals	
without

Serial	
monitoring	
with

typically	
shows	
marked	
night

vari-	
ability	
in	
all	
sleep	
measures	
as	
well	
as	
in	
recorded	
bed	
and	
rising	
times	
.	

This	
variability	
is	
typically	
greater	
than	
that	
of	
comparison	
groups	
of	
good	
sleepers	
.	

Many	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
insomnia	
underestimate	
the	
actual	
sleep	
time	
shown	
by	
polysom-	
nography	
,	
and	
some	
may	
provide	
sleep	
estimates	
that	
fall	
far	
short	
of	
actual	
PSG-	
recorded	
sleep	
time	
.	

This	
latter	
group	
has	
previously	
been	
categorized	
as	
having	
subjective	
insomnia	
,	
sleep	
state	
misperception	
,	
or	
paradoxical	
insomnia	
.	

In	
general	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
insomnia	
tend	
to	
underestimate	
sleep	
duration	
and	
overestimate	
sleep	
latency	
and	
awakenings	
,	
whereas	
good	
sleepers	
tend	
to	
overestimate	
sleep	
duration	
and	
underestimate	
sleep	
latency	
and	
awakenings	
relative	
to	
PSG	
.	

This	
subjective	
-	
ob-	
jective	
mismatch	
may	
be	
related	
to	
physiological	
hyperarousal	
,	
and	
may	
be	
one	
of	
the	
core	
features	
of	
insomnia	
.	

Results	
of	
the	
Multiple	
Sleep	
Latency	
Test	
(	
MSLT	
)	
usually	
show	
normal	
daytime	
alert-	
ness	
.	

In	
several	
studies	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
insomnia	
have	
longer	
mean	
MSLT	
values	
than	
control	
subjects	
,	
suggesting	
hyperalertness	
or	
hyperarousal	
.	

A	
minority	
of	
insomnia	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
particularly	
older	
adults	
with	
insomnia	
,	
have	
reduced	
mean	
MSLT	
values	
indicating	
increased	
sleepiness	
.	

Such	
a	
finding	
should	
prompt	
consideration	
of	
other	
concurrent	
sleep	
disorders	
such	
as	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
.	

Young	
children	ORGANISM
typically	
show	
essentially	
normal	
sleep	
during	
PSG	
monitoring	
when	
the	
caregiver	
is	
present	
and	
appropriate	
limits	
are	
set	
in	
the	
laboratory	
.	

Although	
PSG	
and	
MSLT	
testing	
usually	
are	
not	
helpful	
in	
the	
establishment	
of	
an	
insomnia	
disorder	
diagnosis	
,	
there	
are	
circumstances	
that	
may	
warrant	
such	
testing	
with	
selected	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

PSG	
should	
be	
considered	
when	
there	
are	
reported	
symptoms	
or	
bed	
partner	
observations	
of	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
or	
periodic

movements	
during	
sleep	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
who	
present	
insomnia	
symptoms	
accompanied	
by	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
may	
warrant	
PSG	
and	
MSLT	
testing	
,	
particularly	
if	
narcolepsy	
is	
suspected	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
who	
show	
acceptable	
adherence	
to	
trials	
of	
well	
-	
established	
insom-	
nia	
therapies	
but	
fail	
to	
show	
adequate	
treatment	
response	
may	
benefit	
by	
PSG	
to	
rule	
out	
a	
comorbid	
sleep	
disorder	
.	

Finally	
,	
a	
small	
number	
of	
functional	
imaging	
studies	
have	
been	
conducted	
during	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
in

compared	
to

Specifically

Differential	
Diagnosis	
A	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
that	
presents	
as	
difficulty	
initiating	
sleep	
should	
be	
differen-	
tiated	
from	
delayed	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
.	

In	
the	
latter	
condition	
,	
sleep	
initiation	
is	
consistently	
later	
than	
desired	
because	
the	
individual	
’s	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
is	
delayed	
relative	
to	
the	
desired	
sleep	
schedule	
.	

Sleep	
-	
onset	
difficulties	
persist	
,	
and	
sleep	
time	
is	
reduced	
whenever	
the	
individual	
chooses	
bedtimes	
and	
rising	
times	
that	
are	
too	
early	
and	
out	
of	
phase	
with	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
.	

However	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
delayed	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
are	
able	
to	
fall	
asleep	
with	
less	
difficulty	
,	
and	
sleep	
a	
normal	
amount	
of	
time	
,	
when	
sleeping	
in	
phase	
with	
their	
delayed	
endogenous	
rhythm	
by	
selecting	
late	
bed	
and	
rising	
times	
.	

By	
comparison	
,	
those	
with	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
often	
feel	
sleepy	
at	
the	
desired	
bedtime	
but	
are	
unable	
to	
sleep	
regardless	
of	
the	
timing	
of	
their	
bed	
and	
rise	
times	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
sleep	
problems	
tend	
to	
be	
more	
variable	
on	
a	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
basis	
in	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Given	
the	
prevalence	
of	
delayed	
sleep-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
in	
teenagers	
and	
young	
adults	
,	
it	
is	
particularly	
important	
to	
con-	
sider	
the	
possibility	
of	
this	
alternate	
or	
comorbid	
diagnosis	
when	
evaluating	
individuals	
from	
these	
age	
groups	
presenting	
with	
sleep	
onset	
insomnia	
complaints	
.	

A	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
that	
presents	
as	
a	
difficulty	
maintaining	
sleep	
with	
pre-	
mature	
morning	
rise	
times	
also	
should	
be	
differentiated	
from	
advanced	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
.	

The	
latter	
tends	
to	
be	
more	
common	
in	
older	
adults	
than	
it	
is	
in	
younger	
adults	
and	
children	ORGANISM
.	

Among	
those	
with	
an	
advanced	
sleep	
phase	
pattern	
,	
sleep	
initia-	
tion	
is	
consistently	
earlier	
than	
desired	
because	
the	
individual	
’s	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
is	
advanced	
relative	
to	
the	
desired	
sleep	
schedule	
.	

However	
,	
total	
sleep	
time	
is	
adequate	
when	
the	
individual	
chooses	
early	
bed	
and	
rise	
times	
that	
coincide	
with	
the	
advanced	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
those	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
dis-	
order	
may	
display	
sleep	
maintenance	
difficulties	
and	
early	
morning	
rise	
time	
regard-	
less	
of	
the	
sleep	
schedule	
they	
select	
.	

There	
can	
be	
some	
overlap	
between	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
and	
both	
delayed	
and	
advanced	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorders	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
delayed	
sleep	
pattern	
may	
become	
chronically	
frustrated	
or	
anxious	
about	
their	
inability	
to	
initiate	
sleep	
at	
their	
desired	
times	
,	
and	
this	
frustration	
or	
anxiety	
may	
continue	
to	
disrupt	
sleep	
and	
delay	
sleep	
onset	
well	
beyond	
the	
sleep	
onset	
time	
promoted	
by	
the	
endogenous	
rhythm	
.	

Early	
morning	
awakenings	
may	
similarly	
have	
arousing	
sleep	
disruptive	
effects	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
an	
advanced	
sleep	
phase	
.	

In	
such	
circumstances	
both	
a	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep	
-	
wake	
disorder	
diagnosis	
and	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
diagnosis	
may	
apply	
and	
should	
be	
assigned	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
should	
also	
be	
discriminated	
from	
situational	
sleep	
dif-	
ficulties	
arising	
from	
sleep	
-	
disruptive	
environmental	
circumstances	
.	

A	
variety	
of	
environmental	
factors	
including	
excessive	
noise	
or	
light	
and	
extreme	
temperatures	
will	
disrupt	
the	
sleep	
of	
most	
individuals	
.	

Also	
,	
sleeping	
in	
an	
area	
where	
there	
is	
imminent	
threat	
or	
danger	
to	
one	
’s	
safety	
can	
also	
be	
disruptive	
to	
sleep	
.	

Bed	
part-	
ners	
who	
snore	
loudly	
,	
move	
excessively	
during	
sleep	
,	
or	
have	
parasomnias	
may	
also	
disrupt	
one	
’s	
sleep	
.	

When	
an	
individual	
reports	
environmental	
circumstances	
that	
would	
be	
regarded	
as	
disruptive	
to	
the	
sleep	
of	
most	
individuals	
,	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
should	
not	
be	
assigned	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
applies	
only	
when	
the	
individual	
reports	
sleep	
difficulty	
in	
the	
context	
of	
sleep	
-	
conducive	
envi-	
ronment	
circumstances	
or	
when	
the	
insomnia	
symptoms	
show	
some	
independence	
from	
the	
environmental	
factors	
.	

When	
environmental	
circumstances	
are	
a	
primary	
cause	
of	
sleep	
disturbance	
and	
associated	
consequences	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
other	
sleep	
disorder	
may	
be	
considered	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
should	
also	
be	
differentiated	
from	
patterns	
of	
chronic	
voli-	
tional	
sleep	
restriction	
(	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
)	
.	

Some	
individuals	
show	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
fatigue	
,	
and	
reduced	
sleep	
at	
night	
as	
a	
result	
of	
electing	
overly	
demanding	
daytime	
schedules	
or	
by	
volitionally	
delaying	
sleep	
in	
order	
to	
engage	
in	
desired	
recreational	
or	
social	
activities	
.	

However	
,	
when	
allowing	
themselves	
suffi-	
cient	
time	
to	
sleep	
,	
they	
are	
able	
to	
initiate	
and	
maintain	
sleep	
easily	
and	
for	
a	
normal	
duration	
.	

Those	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
tend	
to	
have	
excessive	
wake	
time	
and	
reduced	
sleep	
time	
despite	
routinely	
allotting	
sufficient	
time	
to	
sleep	
.	

Moreover	
,	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
not	
typically	
associated	
with	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepi-	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
ness	
and	
unintentional	
daytime	
sleep	
episodes	
,	
which	
are	
often	
observed	
in	
those	
with	
patterns	
of	
volitional	
sleep	
restriction	
.	

Insomnia	
symptoms	
may	
occur	
comorbid	
with	
another	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
such	
as	
sleep

or	
restless

persist	
despite	
adequate	
treatment	
reflected	
by	
marked	
symptom

in	
the

A	
chronic	
insomnia

diagnosis	
would	
not	
apply	
when	
effective	
treatment

the	
coincident	
sleep	
disorder	
resolves	
the

Among	
children	ORGANISM
,	
sleep	
difficulties	
may	
be	
present	
when	
the	
child	
has	
to	
sleep	
alone	
in	
a	
separate	
room	
,	
but	
absent	
when	
the	
child	
is	
allowed	
to	
sleep	
with	
parents	
or	
when	
a	
parent	
is	
present	
in	
the	
child	
’s	
bedroom	
.	

An	
absence	
of	
sleep	
difficulties	
under	
the	
latter	
circumstances	
does	
not	
indicate	
the	
insomnia	
is	
resolved	
.	

Only	
when	
the	
child	
is	
able	
to	
sleep	
consistently	
independently	
is	
there	
no	
longer	
an	
insomnia	
problem	
.	

In	
some	
children	ORGANISM
,	
the	
persistence	
of	
sleep	
difficulties	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
parents	
may	
reflect	
underlying	
conditions	
such	
as	
separation	
anxiety	
or	
an	
anxiety	
disorder	
.	

In	
young	
children	ORGANISM
,	
sleep	
difficulties	
can	
be	
the	
result	
of	
medical	
issues	
,	
including	
gas-	
troesophageal	
reflux	
,	
as	
well	
as	
developmental	
milestones	
,	
such	
as	
motoric	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
language	
,	
and	
cognitive	
development	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
,	
adolescents	
,	
and	
adults	
may	
develop	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
comorbid	
with	
a	
medical	
or	
psychiatric	
disorder	
.	

Insomnia	
symp-	
toms	ORGANISM
may	
arise	
as	
a	
result	
of	
either	
another	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
a	
medical	
condition	
,	
or	
a	
psychiatric	
disorder	
that	
has	
sleep	
-	
disruptive	
effects	
.	

A	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
diagnosis	
would	
apply	
when	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
insomnia	
symptoms	
show	
some	
independence	
in	
their	
onset	
or	
variation	
over	
time	
from	
the	
other	
symptoms	
of	
the	
co	
-	
occurring	
sleep	
,	
medical	
,	
or	
psychiatric	
disorder	
;	
or	
(

when	
insomnia	
symptoms	
persist	
despite	
ade-	CELL

reflected	
by	
marked	
symptom	
improvement	
in	
the	
coincident

,	
medical	
,	
or	
psychiatric	
disorder	
.	

Because	
insomnia	
symptoms	
often	
develop	
some	
independence	
over	
time	
,	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
diagnosis	
usually	
will	
be	
war-	
ranted	
when	
those	
symptoms	
are	
persistent	
in	
association	
with	
a	
chronic	
medical	
or	
psychiatric	
disorder	
.	

A	
chronic	
insomnia

diagnosis	
would	
not	
apply	
when	
effective	
treatment	
of

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Much	
remains	
to	
be	
learned	
about	
the	
underlying	
pathophysiological	
pathways	
leading	
to	
insomnia	
and	
whether	
insomnia	
should	
be	
classified	
as	
a	
unitary	
disorder	
or	
sub-	
divided	
into	
several	
subtypes	
.	

Clearly	
,	
these	
issues	
are	
closely	
linked	
.	

Further	
studies	
that	
clarify	
the	
pathophysiological	
pathways	
leading	
to	
insomnia	
ultimately	
will	
reveal	
whether	
those	
meeting	
current	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
suffer	
from	
a	
single	
disease	
or	
multiple	
separate	
diseases	
with	
similar	
outward	
presentations	
.	

A	
related	
unresolved	
issue	
is	
whether	
the	
current	
global	
classification	
promotes	
a	
generic	
approach	
to	
insomnia	
therapy	
that	
ultimately	
fails	
to	
benefit	
some	
insomnia	
subgroups	
.	

Perhaps	
this	
global	
classification	
scheme	
will	
overlook	
distinctive	
insomnia	
subtypes	
with	
specific	
treatment	
needs	
that	
vary	
from	
the	
generic	
treatments	
typically	
provided	
.	

Previous	
editions	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
allowed	
for	
the	
assignment	
of	
an	
insomnia	
diagnosis	
to	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
present	
exclusively	
with	
com-	TISSUE
plaints	
of	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
;	
that	
is	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
complain	
only	
of	
sleep	
that	
is	
poor	
in	
quality	
or	
unrefreshing	
,	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
sleep	
-	
onset	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
,	
could	
qualify	
for	
an	
insomnia	
diagnosis	
in	
previous	
versions	
of	
this	
nosol-	
ogy	
.	

The	
current	
version	
of	
this	
nosology	
excludes	
such	
patients	ORGANISM
from	
the	
insomnia	
diagnostic	
categories	
.	

This	
decision	
was	
based	
on	
several	
considerations	
.	

Most	
insom-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
nia	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
patients	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
present	
with	
complaints	
of	
sleep	
initiation	
or	
maintenance	
difficulties	
.	

Although	
a	
small	
subset	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
present	
with	
isolated	
complaints	
of	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
,	
this	
complaint	
more	
commonly	
arises	
in	
association	
with	
other	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	
,	
or	
in	
conjunction	
with	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
,	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
or	
certain	
chronic	
medical	
conditions	
(	
e.g.	
,	
fibromyalgia	
or	
chronic	
fatigue	
syndrome	
)	
.	

Although	
various	
epidemiological	
studies	
have	
identified	
subgroups	
who	
are	
presumed	
to	
have	
an	
insomnia	
disorder	
and	
present	
solely	
with	
a	
complaint	
that	
their	
sleep	
is	
non-	
restorative	
or	
unrefreshing	
,	
such	
studies	
typically	
lack	
polysomnography	
that	
would	
be	
needed	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
occult	
sleep	
disorders	
as	
a	
cause	
.	

Finally	
,	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
remains	
a	
poorly	
defined	
construct	
that	
may	
reflect	
not	
only	
a	
type	
of	
sleep	
disturbance	
,	
but	
also	
the	
daytime	
consequences	
of	
poor	
sleep	
such	
as	
fatigue	
and	
anergia	
.	

This	
con-	
struct	
would	
benefit	
from	
further	
definitional	
efforts	
and	
research	
to	
explore	
its	
clinical	
significance	
in	
the	
context	
of	
insomnia	
.	

Given	
these	
considerations	
,	
the	
isolated	
com-	
plaint	
of	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
was	
not	
retained	
as	
part	
of	
the	
diagnostic	
definition	
of	
the	
insomnia	
disorders	
delineated	
in	
this	
manual

Resistance	
going	
to

on	
an	
appropriate	
schedule	
and	
difficulty	
sleeping	
without	
parent	
or	
caregiver	
intervention	
is	
seen	
most	
commonly	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
older	
adults	
who	
require	
the	
supervision	
of	
a	
caretaker	
due	
to	
a	
significant	
level	
of	
functional	
impairment	
(	
e.g.	
,	
those	
with	
dementia	
)	
.	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
may	
complain	
of	
sleep/	
wake	
difficulties	
fewer	
than	
three	
times	
per	
week	
on	
average	
,	
yet	
have	
clinically	
significant	
concerns	
about	
their	
symptoms	
and	
warrant	
clinical	
attention	
.	
.	

Many	
conditions	
such	
as	
grief	
,	
acute	
pain	
,	
or	
other	
acute	
stressors	
are	
quite	
often	
associated	
with	
poor	
sleep	
.	

When	
such	
conditions	
are	
the	
sole	
cause	
of	
the	
sleep	
difficulty	
,	
a	
separate	
insomnia	
diagnosis	
may	
not	
apply	
.	

The	
primary	
factor	
in	
determining	
application	
of	
a	
short-	
term	
or	
adjustment	
insomnia	
diagnosis	
is	
the	
extent	
to	
which	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
becomes	
a	
significant	
focus	
for	
the	
individual	
and/or	
warrants	
independent	
clinical	
attention	
.	

Essential	
Features	
The	
essential	
feature	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
a	
short	
-	
term	
difficulty	
ini-	
tiating	
or	
maintaining	
sleep	
that	
results	
in	
general	
sleep	
dissatisfaction	
.	

The	
sleep	
complaint	
is	
accompanied	
by	
daytime	
distress	
about	
poor	
sleep	
or	
impairment	
in	
family	
,	
social	
,	
occupational	
,	
academic	
,	
or	
other	
important	
areas	
of	
functioning	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
and	
associated	
daytime	
symptoms	
occur	
despite	
having	
adequate	
time	
and	
circumstances	
each	
night	
to	
obtain	
necessary	
sleep	
.	

Short-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
can	
occur	
in	
isolation	
or	
comorbid	
with	
a	
mental	
disorder	
,	
medical	
condition	
,	
or	
substance	
use	
.	

In	
many	
cases	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
lasting	
less	
than	
three	
months	
,	
there	
is	
an	
identifiable	
cause	
that	
serves	
as	
the	
precipitant	
.	

In	
other	
cases	
,	
insomnia	
occurs	
episodically	
,	
often	
coincident	
to	
daytime	
stressors	
that	
account	
for	
the	
insomnia	
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
sleep	
complaints	
that	
compose	
short-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
may	
include	
difficulties	
initiating	
sleep	
or	
difficulties	
main-	
taining	
sleep	
.	

The	
latter	
complaint	
may	
include	
waking	
up	
during	
the	
night	
with	
difficulty	
returning	
to	
sleep	
or	
having	
a	
final	
awakening	
occurring	
too	
early	
,	
well	
before	
the	
desired	
rising	
time	
.	

Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
may	
be	
character-	
ized	
solely	
by	
sleep	
onset	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
or	
,	
more	
commonly	
,	
by	
both	
types	
of	
complaints	
occurring	
together	
.	

Individuals	
’	
sleep	
complaints	
may	
vary	
such	
that	
sleep	
onset	
difficulties	
are	
apparent	
on	
some	
nights	
,	
whereas	
sleep	
maintenance	
difficulties	
are	
present	
on	
other	
nights	
.	

Complaints	
about	
poor	
-	
quality	
,	
unrefreshing	
,	
or	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
may	
accompany	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sleep	
mainte-	ORGANISM
nance	ORGANISM
complaints	
,	
but	
do	
not	
meet	
the	
definition	
of	
this	
condition	
when	
they	
occur	
in	
isolation	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Sleep	
disturbance	
is	
the	
primary	
feature	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
but	
it	
is	
com-	ORGAN
monly	
accompanied	
by	
waking	
symptoms	
similar	
to	
those	
seen	
in	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Specific	
symptoms	
such	
as	
fatigue	
,	
impaired	
attention	
and	
concentration	
,	
poor	
memory	
,	
irritability	
,	
and	
distress	
about	
poor	
sleep	
are	
common	
.	

When	
the	
insomnia	
arises	
in	
reaction	
to	
a	
stressful	
life	
event	
,	
such	
as	
the	
loss	
of	
a	
loved	
one	
,	
major	
illness	
,	
or	
divorce	
,	
the	
associated	
features	
may	
include	
anxiety	
,	
worry	
,	
ruminative	
thoughts	
,	
sadness	
,	
or	
depression	
in	
relation	
to	
the	
specific	
stressor	
.	

If	
the	
individual	
uses	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
illicit	
drugs	
,	
or	
medications	
for	
self

,	
additional	
symptoms	
related	
to	
these	
substances	
may	
be	
seen

Demographics	
Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
can	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
.	

However	
,	
a	
short	
-	
term	
form	
of	
insomnia	
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
establish	
in	
infants	
because	
it	
is	
often	
difficult	
to	
link	
stressors	
to	
sleep	
disturbances	
in	
this	
age	
group	
.	

The	
exact	
prevalence	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
unknown	
.	

The	
one	
-	
year	
prevalence	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
dis-	
order	
among	
adults	
appears	
to	
be	
in	
the	
range	
of	
15	
%	
to	
20	
%	
.	

Like	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
more	
prevalent	
in	
women	ORGANISM
than	
in	
men	ORGANISM
,	
and	
in	
older	
age	
groups	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Affected	
individuals	
may	
note	
a	
lifelong	
tendency	
toward	
light	
sleep	
or	
diffi-	
culty	
sleeping	
during	
times	
of	
stress	
.	

A	
previous	
history	
of	
anxiety	
or	
depressive	
Insomnia	
Insomnia	
symptoms	
and	
disorders	
also	
may	
predispose	
an	
individual	
to	
develop	
a	
short-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

In	
children	ORGANISM
,	
having	
a	
parent	
with	
insomnia	
or	
living	
in	
a	
household	
lacking	
parental	
reinforcement	
of	
a	
consistent	
sleep	
/	
wake	
schedule	
may	
be	
predisposing	
factors	
.	

An	
acute	
,	
identifiable	
event	
or	
stressor	
usually	
precipitates	
this	
form	
of	
insomnia	
.	

Common	
precipitating	
events	
include	
changes	
or	
disputes	
in	
interpersonal	
relation-	
ships	
,	
occupational	
stress	
,	
personal	
losses	
,	
bereavement	
,	
diagnosis	
or	
onset	
of	
a	
new	
medical	
condition	
,	
visiting	
or	
moving	
to	
a	
new	
location	
,	
or	
physical	
changes	
to	
the	
usual	
sleep	
environment	
or	
schedule	
.	

Changes	
or	
stresses	
with	
a	
positive	
emotional	
tone	
also	
may	
serve	
as	
precipitating	
events	
.	

In	
children	ORGANISM
or	
dependent	
adults	
,	
such	
insomnia	
can	
arise	
when	
the	
caretaker	
makes	
abrupt	
changes	
in	
the	
child	
’s	
or	
adult	
’s	
sleep	
routines	
or	
schedule	
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
environ-	
mental	
factors	
such	
as	
the	
child	
sharing	
a	
room	
with	
a	
parent	
or	
with	
other	
sib-	
lings	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
extended	
family	
or	
others	
in	
the	
home	
,	
and	
cramped	
living	
accommodations	
may	
contribute	
to	
negative	
sleep	
-	
onset	
associations	
or	
poor	
limit	
setting	
in	
children	ORGANISM
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Familial	
patterns	
are	
less	
well	
documented	
for	
cases	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disor-	
der	
than	
they	
are	
for	
individuals	
meeting	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
the	
familial	
aggregation	
found	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorders	
is	
expected	
to	
also	
occur	
among	
individuals	
with	
more	
transient	
forms	
of	
insomnia	
.	

Data	
support	
a	
greater	
genetic	
diathesis	
to	
psychophysiologic	
arousal	
among	
certain	
individuals	
in	
response	
to	
stressors	
.	

This	
may	
,	
in	
turn	
,	
suggest	
a	
constitutional	
predisposition	
to	
short-	
term	
or	
adjustment	
insomnia	
in	
such	
individuals	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Many	
individuals	ORGANISM
who	
develop	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
experience	
remission	
of	
their	
insomnia	
symptoms	
over	
time	
.	

This	
occurs	
as	
distress	
over	
the	
precipitating	
event	
diminishes	
over	
time	
or	
in	
response	
to	
withdrawal	
of	
the	
stressor	
.	

However	
,	
a	
portion	
of	
those	
who	
initially	
experience	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
may	
develop	
a	
more	
chronic	
form	
of	
insomnia	
and	
subsequently	
meet	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
dis-	
order	
.	

These	
individuals	
will	
then	
have	
the	
course	
and	
complications	
described	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
is	
the	
case	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
would	
not	
be	
considered	
until	
after	
a	
child	
reaches	
at	
least	
six	
months	
of	
age	
.	

The	
propensity	
to	
experience	
sleep	
disturbance	
in	
response	
to	
stress	
may	
dispose	
young	
and	
older	
individuals	
toward	
acute	
forms	
of	
insomnia	
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
sleep	
onset	
difficulties	
are	
most	
common	
among	
young	
adults	
with	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
,	
whereas	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
and	
early	
morning	
awakening	
are	
more	
common	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
and	
older	
adults	
.	

Objective	
daytime	
sleepiness	
is	
uncommon	
in	
younger	
adults	
with	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
but	
is	
more	
common	
in	
older	
adults	
.	

Balancing	
job	
and	
family	
stressors	
may	
contribute	
to	
intermittent	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
problems	
in	
younger	
and	
middle	
-	
aged	
adults	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
older	
,	
retired	
adults	
may	
have	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
related	
to	
exacerbations	
in	
comorbid	
chronic	
medical	
con-	
ditions	
or	
due	
to	
loss	
of	
loved	
ones	
that	
commonly	
occurs	
with	
advancing	
age	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Research	
on	
the	
pathology	
and	
pathophysiology	
of	
short	
-	
term	
variants	
of	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
generally	
lacking	
because	
the	
majority	
of	
studies	
addressing	
this	
issue	
have	
focused	
on	
samples	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorders	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
shares	
many	
features	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

The	
primary	
difference	
between	
the	
two	
conditions	
is	
that	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disor-	
der	
does	
not	
meet	
the	
duration	
and	
frequency	
criteria	
required	
for	
the	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
diagnosis	
.	

Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
also	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep	
-	
wake	
disorders	
resulting	
from	
rotating	
shift	
work	
or	
jet	
lag	
.	

In	
the	
latter	
case	
,	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
arises	
from	
a	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedule	
alteration	
that	
results	
in	
a	
mismatch	
between	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
and	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedule	
chosen	
—	
for	
example	
,	
having	
to	
sleep	
in	
the	
daytime	
rather	
than	
during	
the	
nighttime	
.	

In	
the	
case	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
no	
such	
mismatch	
exists	
;	
yet	
,	
the	
individual	
demonstrates	
sleep	
onset	
or	
maintenance	
difficulties	
nonetheless

This	
diagnosis	
is	
reserved	
for	
individuals	
who	
complain	
of	
difficulty	
initiating	
and	
maintaining	
sleep	
and	
yet	
do	
not	
meet	
the	
full	
criteria	
for	
either	
chronic	
insomnia	
dis-	
order	
or	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
this	
diagnosis	
may	
be	
assigned	
on	
a	
provisional	
basis	
when	
more	
information	
is	
needed	
to	
establish	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
or	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

It	
is	
expected	
that	
this	
diag-	
nosis	
will	
be	
used	
sparingly	
,	
given	
its	
nonspecific	
nature

Isolated	
Symptoms	
and	
Normal	
Variants	
Excessive	
Time	
in	
Bed	

Some	
individuals	
may	
present	
with	
isolated	
insomnia	
symptoms	
such	
as	
prolonged	
sleep	
latencies	
or	
long	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
during	
the	
night	
,	
yet	
not	
complain	
of	
insomnia	
nor	
show	
daytime	
impairments	
.	

In	
children	ORGANISM
,	
this	
pattern	
may	
emerge	
when	
parents	
or	
caregivers	
have	
unrealistic	
expectations	
for	
the	
child	
’s	
sleep	
needs	
and	
rou-	
tinely	
allot	
too	
much	
time	
for	
the	
child	
to	
be	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
this	
pattern	
is	
perhaps	
most	
common	
in	
noncomplaining	
groups	
who	
routinely	
allot	
significantly	
more	
time	
in	
bed	
than	
needed	
for	
sleep	
.	

For	
example	
,	
some	
individuals	
who	
are	
retired	
from	
work	
or	
not	
currently	
employed	
may	
routinely	
spend	
excessive	
time	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
and	
are	
not	
bothered	
by	
the	
expanded	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
they	
routinely	
experience	
.	

At	
present	
,	
epidemiological	
and	
laboratory	
studies	
are	
unable	
to	
ascertain	
whether	
adverse	
health	
outcomes	
are	
more	
strongly	
associated	
with	
perceived	
sleep	
difficulties	
/	
dissatisfaction	
or	
with	
particular	
objective	
indices	
of	
sleep	
duration	
,	
sleep	
latency	
,	
and	
sleep	
continuity	
.	

Short	
Sleeper	
Some	
individuals	
routinely	
obtain	
less	
than	
six	
hours	
of	
sleep	
per	
night	
on	
average	
yet	
have	
no	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaints	
.	

Such	
individuals	
are	
considered	
to	
be	
normal	
short	
sleepers	
if	
they	
have	
no	
complaints	
of	
sleep	
difficulties	
and	
show	
no	
obvious	
daytime	
dysfunction	
.	

Among	
these	
individuals	
,	
the	
observed	
relatively	
low	
average	
sleep	
time	
does	
not	
result	
from	
chronic	
volitional	
sleep	
restriction	
,	
as	
in	
the	
case	
of	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
,	
but	
rather	
indicates	
a	
constitutional	
disposition	
for	
reduced	
sleep	
requirement	
.	

The	
clinical	
significance	
of	
chronic	
short	
sleep	
duration	
,	
and	
the	
identifi-	
cation	
of	
possible	
subtypes	
,	
remain	
open	
questions	
.	

Various	
studies	
have	
linked	
short	
sleep	
duration	
with	
metabolic	
,	
cardiovascular	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
,	
and	
other	
forms	
of	
medical	
morbidity	
.	

However	
,	
these	
studies	
are	
typically	
unable	
to	
distinguish	
between	
individuals	
who	
have	
short	
sleep	
in	
the	
context	
of	
insomnia	
or	
another	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
those	
who	
are	
voluntarily	
restricting	
their	
sleep	
,	
and	
those	
who	
may	
have	
naturally	
short	
sleep	
.	

Short	
sleep	
resulting	
from	
different	
causes	
may	
have	
different	
pathophysiological	
signifi-	
cance	
.	

At	
present	
,	
those	
who	
demonstrate	
less	
than	
six	
hours	
of	
sleep	
per	
night	
should	
not	
be	
assigned	
an	
insomnia	
diagnosis	
unless	
they	
also	
meet	
the	
criteria	
for	
one	
of	
the	
insomnia	
disorder	
subtypes	
described	
herein

The	
sleep	
related	
breathing	
disorders	
are	
characterized	
by	
abnormalities	
of	
respi-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
ration	
during	
sleep	
.	

In	
some	
of	
these	
disorders	
,	
respiration	
is	
also	
abnormal	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

The	
disorders	
are	
grouped	
into	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
(	
OSA	
)	
disorders	
,	
central	
sleep	
apnea	
disorders	
,	
sleep

and

However	
,	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
will	
meet	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
more	
than	
one	
of	
these	
groups	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
a	
combination	
of	
obstruc-	
tive	
and	
central	
sleep	
apnea	
.	

Although	
a	
diagnosis	
is	
often	
based	
on	
which	
disorder	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
predominates	
,	
this	
may	
vary	
from	
night	
to	
night	
as	
well	
as	
over	
time	
in	
individual	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

There	
is	
also	
overlap	
in	
pathophysiology	
,	
as	
some	
central	
apneas	
are	
associ-	
ated	
with	
a	
closed	
upper	
airway	
and	
many	
obstructive	
apneas	
begin	
during	
a	
time	
of	
falling	
ventilatory	
drive	
.	

In	
the

that	
follow	
,	
individual	
respiratory	
events	
(	
e.g.	
,	
apneas	
,	
hypopneas

and	
hypoventilation	
)	
are	
not	
defined	
;	
rather	
,	
reference	
is	
made	
to	
the	
most

The

disorders	
are

as	
the	
presenta-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
tion

,	
and	
complications	
differ	
significantly	
.	

These	
disorders	
are	
characterized	
by	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
narrowing	
or	
closure	
during	
sleep	
while	
respiratory	
effort	
continues	
(	
at

of	
the	
event	
)

recorded	
)	
is	
now	
included	
in	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
adult

.	

The	
central

syndromes	
are	
characterized	
by	
reduction

cessation	
of	
airflow	
due	
to	
absent

reduced	
respiratory	
effort

Central

may	
occur	
in	
a	
cyclical	
or	
intermittent	
fashion	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
central

of	
various	
etiologies	
may	
also	
exhibit

In	
primary

the	
cause	
of	
the

In	
central

there	
is	
a

respiration	
separated	
by	
central

Most

other	
neurological

In	
high

peri-	
odic	
breathing	
,	
the	
disorder	
is	
associated	
with	
acute	
ascent

Symptoms	
must	
be	
present	
to	
establish	
the	
diagnosis

,	
as	
this	
breathing

is	
an	
expected

Central

due	
to	
medical	
or	
neurological	
condition

These

In	
central	
sleep	
apnea	
due	
to

,	
the

In	
this	
edition	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of

,	
there	
are	
a	
number	
of	
changes	
in	
the	
classification	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
disorders	
.	

The	
obesity	
hypoventilation	
syndrome	
is	
listed	
as	
a	
separate	
disorder	
given	
that	
it	
is	
both	
prevalent	
and	
has	
distinct	
clinical	
characteristics	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
other	
sleep	
related	
hypoventila-	
tion	
disorders	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
obesity	
hypoventilation	
syndrome	
requires	
documenta-	
tion	
of	
awake	
(	
daytime	
)	
hypoventilation	
(	
PaCO2	
>	
45	
mm	
Hg	
)	
.	

For	
the	
other	
disorders	
in	
this	
category	
,	
awake	
hypoventilation	
may	
or	
may	
not	
be	
present	
.	

In	
the	
previous	
version	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
a	
group	
of	
disorders	
were	
listed	
under	
the	
category	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
/	
hypoxemia	
disorders	
.	

In	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
,	
disorders	
manifesting	
hypoventilation	
are	
separated	
from	
disorders	
in	
which	
only	
a	
finding	
of	
hypoxemia	
(	
arterial	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

)	
during	
sleep	
is	
documented

The	
term	
upper

resistance	
syndrome	
(	
UARS	
)	
is	
subsumed	
under	
this

from	
that	
of

Use	
of	
the

is	
discouraged	
because	
not	
only	
has	
it	
been	
applied	
to	
those	
with	
OSA

also	
indiscriminately	
used	
to

OCST	
commonly	
underestimates	
the	
number	
of	
obstructive	
respiratory	
events	
per	
hour	
as	
compared	
to	
PSG	
because	
actual	
sleep	
time	
,	
as	
determined	
primarily	
by	
EEG	
,	
is	
often	
not	
recorded	
.	

The	
term	
respiratory	
event	
index	
(	
REI	
)	
may	
be	
used	
to	
denote	
event	
frequency	
based	
on	
monitoring	
time	
rather	
than	
total	
sleep	
time	
.	
.	

Respiratory

RERAs	
and	
hypopnea	
events	
based	
on	
arousals	
from	
sleep	
can	
not	
be	
scored	
using	
OCST	
because	
arousals

criteria	
can	
not	
be

.	

Essential	
Features	
OSA	
is	
characterized	
by	
repetitive	
episodes	
of	
complete	
(	
apnea	
)	
or	
partial	
(	
hypopnea	
)	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
obstruction	
occurring	
during	
sleep	
.	

These	
events	
often	
result	
in	
reduc-	
tions	
in	
blood	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
oxygen	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
saturation	
and	
are	
usually	
terminated	
by	
brief	
arousals	
from	
sleep	
.	

By	
definition	
,	
apneic	
and	
hypopneic	
events	
last	
a	
minimum	
of	
10	
seconds	
.	

Most	
events	
are	
10	
to	
30	
seconds	
in	
duration	
but	
occasionally	
persist	
for	
one	
minute	
or	
longer	
.	

Events	
can	
occur	
in	
any	
stage	
of	
sleep	
but	
more	
frequently	
occur	
in	
stages	
N1	
,	
N2	
,	
and	
R	
sleep	
than	
in	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

Events	
are	
usually	
longer	
and	
associated	
with	
more	
severe	
decreases	
in	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
saturation	
when	
they	
occur	
in	
stage	
R	
sleep	
and	
when	
the	
individual	
is	
sleeping	
supine	
.	

Oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
saturation	
usually	
returns	
to	
baseline	
values	
following	
resumption	
of	
normal	
breathing	
but	
may	
remain	
low	
if	
the	
apneic	
or	
hypopneic	
events	
are	
very	
frequent	
and	
prolonged	
,	
or	
if	
there	
is	
underlying	
pulmonary	ORGAN
pathology	
.	

Snoring	
between	
apneas	
is	
typically	
reported	
by	
bed	
partners	
,	
as	
are	
wit-	ORGANISM
nessed	
episodes	
of	
gasping	
or	
choking	
and	
body	
movements	
that	
disrupt	
sleep	
.	

Most	
patients	ORGANISM
awaken	
in	
the	
morning	
feeling	
tired	
and	
unrefreshed	
regardless	
of	
the	
duration	
of	
their	
time	
in	
bed	
.	

Apneas	
,	
hypopneas	
,	
and	
snoring	
may	
be	
exacerbated	
following	
the	
ingestion	
of	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
use	
of	
sedating	
medications	
prior	
to	
sleep	
,	
or	
following	
an	
increase	
in	
body	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
weight	
.	

Excessive	
sleepiness	
is	
a	
major	
presenting	
complaint	
in	
many	
but	
not	
all	
cases	
.	

The	
sleepiness	
is	
most	
evident	
during	
relaxing	
or	
inactive	
situations	
.	

With	
extreme	
sleepi-	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
ness	
,	
sleep	
may	
occur	
while	
actively	
conversing	
,	
eating	
,	
walking	
,	
or	
driving	
.	

In	
women	ORGANISM
,	
excessive	
sleepiness	
is	
a	
less	
prominent	
complaint	
.	

Additionally	
,	
reports	
of	
insomnia	
,	
poor	
sleep	
quality	
,	
and	
fatigue	
are	
common	
,	
particularly	
among	
women	ORGANISM
.	

Quality	
of	
life	
generally	
is	
adversely	
affected	
by	
unrefreshing	
sleep	
,	
sleepiness	
,	
and	
fatigue	
.	

Bed	
part-	
ners	
may	
also	
report	
sleep	
disruption	
and	
associated	
consequences	
.	

The	
frequency	
of	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
during	
sleep	
correlates	
poorly	
with	
daytime	
symptom	
severity	
and	
impact	
on	
quality	
of	
life	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
affected	
individuals	
will	
not	
endorse	
any	
symptoms	
or	
confirm	
any	
bed	
partner	
observations	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Systemic	
hypertension	
is	
a	
common	
finding	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
.	

There	
is	
substan-	
tial	
clinical	
and	
epidemiologic	
evidence	
implicating	
OSA	
as	
a	
significant	
risk	
factor	
for	
development	
of	
systemic	
hypertension	
independent	
of	
other	
conditions	
such	
as	
obesity	
and	
smoking	
.	

Additionally	
,	
OSA	
is	
frequently	
observed	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
cor-	
onary	
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
,	
atrial	
fibrillation	
,	
and	
stroke	
,	
and	
it	
may	
be	
an	
independent	
risk	
factor	
for	
these	
conditions	
.	

OSA	
is	
also	
associated	
with	
type	
2	
diabetes	
,	
and	
there	
are	
accumulating	
data	
to	
suggest	
that	
it	
is	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
type	
2	
diabetes	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
severe	
disease	CANCER
may	
be	
at	
risk	
for	
developing	
pulmo-	
nary	
hypertension	
and	
cor	
pulmonale	
,	
although	
this	
is	
usually	
seen	
only	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
daytime	
hypercapnia	
due	
to	
comorbid	
conditions	
such	
as	
morbid	
obesity	
or	
chronic	
obstructive	
pulmonary	ORGAN
disease	
(	
COPD	CANCER
)	
.	

When	
OSA	
coexists	
with	
dilated	
cardiomyopathy	
or	
ischemic	
heart	ORGAN
disease	
,	
there	
may	
be	
worsening	
of	
the	
underly-	
ing	
heart	ORGAN
disease	
and	
predisposition	
to	
congestive	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
.	

Gastroesophageal	
reflux	
symptoms	
,	
nocturia	
,	
mood	
disturbance	
,	
and	
erectile	ORGAN
dysfunction	
are	
some-	
times	
reported	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
.	

The	
disorder	
can	
also	
be	
associated	
with	
the	
following	
motor	
parasomnias	
:	
OSA	
-	
induced	
arousals	
from	
non	
-	
rapid	
eye	ORGAN
movement	
(	
NREM	CANCER
)	
sleep	
mimicking	
a	
primary	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
(	
confusional	
arousal	
,	
sleep-	
walking	
,	
or	
sleep	
terrors	
)	
;	
OSA	
-	
induced	
arousals	
from	
REM	
sleep	
mimicking	
REM	
sleep	
behavior	
disorder	
;	
disorders	
of

from	
NREM	
associated	
with

during	
initiation	
of	
nasal	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
continuous

therapy	
of

;	
OSA	
-

arousals	
linked	
with

;	
and	
OSA	
-	
induced	
nocturnal	
seizures	
or	
cerebral	ORGAN
anoxic	
attacks	
with	
prominent	
motor	
activity	
.	

Severity	
of	
OSA	
as	
determined	
by	
the	
frequency	
of	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
and/or	
degree	
of	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
correlates	
poorly	
with	
symptomatic	
sleepiness	
.	

Different	
measures	
of	
sleepiness	
,	
including	
self	
-	
reported	
severity	
of	
sleepiness	
,	
commonly	
used	
indices	
such	
as	
the	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
,	
and	
objective	
measures	
such	
as	
the	
Multiple	
Sleep	
Latency	
Test	
(	
MSLT	
)	
,	
are	
not	
strongly	
correlated	
and	
,	
thus	
,	
assessment	
of	
sleepiness	
can	
be	
difficult	
and	
relatively	
unreliable	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
adapt	
to	
any	
level	
of	
sleepiness	
over	
time	
and	
fail	
to	
view	
it	
as	
a	
reportable	
problem	
.	

Bed

and	
disruptive	
snoring	
may	
not	
always	
be	
accompa-	
nied	
by	
patient	ORGANISM
complaints	
of	
sleepiness	
.	

Finally	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
note	
that	
sleepiness	
is	
a	
condition	
with	
a	
number	
of	
possible	
etiologies	
and	
a	
range	
of	
manifestations	
(

Differential	
Diagnosis	
)

Sleep	
Related

Disorders	
Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
are	
believed	
to	
have	
similar	
pathophysiology	
and	
consequences	
.	

Therefore	
,	
from	
a	
clinical	
perspective	
,	
there	
is	
little	
importance	
in	
distinguishing	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
have	
predominantly	
apnea	
from	
those	
who	
have	
predominantly	
hypopnea	
.	

Occasionally	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
demonstrate	
only	
REM	
-	
related	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	
,	
but	
there	
is	
no	
consensus	
to	
suggest	
that	
this	
is	
a	
distinct	
clinical	
or	
pathophysiological	
subtype	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
relatively	
few	
arterial	AMINO_ACID
oxygen	AMINO_ACID
desaturations	AMINO_ACID
but	
a	
significant	
number	
of	
respiratory	
events	
characterized	
by	
narrowing	
of	
the	
upper	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
airway	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
result-	
ing	
in	
brief	
arousals	
from	
sleep	
.	

Depending	
on	
the	
definition	
of	
hypopnea	
employed	
,	
these	
events	
typically	
meet	
criteria	
for	
either	
hypopneas	
associated	
with	
arousal	
but	
no	
desaturation	
,	
or	
for	
RERAs	
.	

When	
initially	
described	
,	
this	
latter	
group	
was	
said	
to	
have	
UARS	
.	

Current	
data	
suggest	
that	
this	
condition	
represents	
simply	
a	
variant	
of	
OSA	
in	
which	
obstructive	
events	
result	
in	
arousal	
but	
minimal	
arterial	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
oxygen	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
this	
condition	
commonly	
snore	
and	
report	
daytime	
sleepiness	
or	
fatigue	
.	

However	
,	
there	
are	
some	
reports	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
frequent	
respiratory	
arousals	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
snoring	
.	

They	
tend	
to	
be	
less	
obese	
than	
individuals	
who	
have	
respiratory

.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
this	
group	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
is	
unknown	
.	

When	
advanced	
technology	
is	
used	
to	
detect	
changes	
in	
airflow	
(	
as	
described	
in	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated

)	
,	
most	
of	
these

will	
be	
diagnosed	
as	
having	
OSA	
,	
as

by	
the	
criteria

but	
there	
is	
no

Nevertheless	
,	
individuals	
with	
both	
disorders	
have	
greater	
nocturnal	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
and	
daytime	
hypercapnia	
for	
the	
same	
degree	
of

obstruc-	
tion	
,	
and	
greater	
risk	
of	
developing	
pulmonary	ORGAN

and	
right	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
.	

The	
prevalence	
rate	
for	
having	
both	
conditions	
has	
been	
estimated	
to	
be	
1	
%	
.	

Demographics	
OSA	
can	
occur	
in	
any	
age	
group	
.	

Estimates	
of	
prevalence	
are	
very	
dependent	
on	
how	
sleep	
related	
respiratory	
events	
are	
defined	
,	
as	
well	
as	
their	
frequency	
and	
other	
criteria	
used	
to	
define	
disease	CANCER
.	

Nevertheless	
,	
general	
population	
-	
based	
studies	
from	
a	
number	
of	
countries	
indicate	
that	
OSA	
associated	
with	
daytime	
sleepiness	
occurs	
in	
3	
%	
to	
7	
%	
of	
adult	
men	ORGANISM
and	
2	
%	
to	
5	
%	
of	
adult	
women	ORGANISM
.	

However	
,	
because	
many	
individuals	
with	
OSA	
do	
not	
endorse	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
the	
prevalence	
of	
the	
disease	
is	
likely	
much	
higher	
.	

A	
major	
study	
yielded	
prevalence	
rates	
as	
high	
as	
24	
%	
in	
men	ORGANISM
and	
9	
%	
in	
women	ORGANISM
using	
only	
an	
apnea	
-	
hypopnea	
index	
(	
AHI	
)	
criterion	
of	
≥	
5	
/	
hour	
,	
although	
addition	
of	
a	
daytime	
sleepiness	
criterion	
reduced	
these	
estimates	
to	
4	
%	
in	
males	
and	
2	
%	
in	
females	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
OSA	
increases	
with	
age	
,	
although	
it	
appears	
to	
plateau	
in	
the	
elderly	
.	

The	
ratio	
of	
OSA	
in	
men	ORGANISM
compared	
to	
women	ORGANISM
is	
approximately	
two	
to	
one	
.	

This	
dispar-	
ity	
may	
decline	
in	
middle	
to	
older	
age	
as	
a	
result	
of	
a	
greater	
risk	
for	
OSA	
in	
women	ORGANISM
after	
menopause	
.	

OSA	
occurs	
in	
all	
racial	
and	
ethnic	
groups	
.	

In	
younger	
and	
elderly	
groups	
,	
but	
not	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
groups	
,	
OSA	
has	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
more	
prevalent	
in	
blacks	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
than	
whites	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
OSA	
in	
Asian	
patients	ORGANISM
is	
comparable	
to	
that	
of	
whites	
,	
despite	
having	
a	
generally	
lower	
body	
mass	
index	
(	
BMI	
)	
.	

Differences	
in	
craniofacial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
features	
that	
predispose	
Asians	
to	
developing	
OSA	
are	
the	
likely	
explanation	
.	

Data	
comparing	
OSA	
prevalence	
rates	
among	
Hispanics	
and	
Native	
Americans	
to	
other	
racial	
/	
ethnic	
groups	
are	
sparse	
,	
although	
it	
is	
clear	
that	
OSA	
occurs	
commonly	
in	
these	
groups	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	

The	
major	
predisposing	
factor	
for	
OSA	
is	
excess	
body	
weight	
.	

It	
has	
been	
estimated	
that	
~60	
%	
of	
moderate	
to	
severe	
OSA	
is	
attributable	
to	
obesity	
.	

The	
risk	
of	
OSA	
increases	
as	
the	
degree	
of	
additional	
weight	
increases	
,	
with	
an	
extremely	
high	
preva-	
lence	
of	
OSA	
in	
people	ORGANISM
with	
morbid	
obesity	
.	

OSA	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
normal	
or	
below

nor-	
mal	
body	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
weight	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
have	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
obstruction	
due	
to	
a	
localized	
structural	
abnormality	
such	
as	
a	
maxillomandibular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
malformation	
or	
adenotonsillar	
enlargement	
.	

Increasing	
neck	
circumference	
predicts	
higher	
AHIs	
;	
it	
is	
not	
,	
however	
,	
independent	
of	
BMI	
.	

Instability	
in	
ventilatory	
control	
appears	
to	
increase	
risk	
of	
OSA	
.	

Those	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
an	
exaggerated	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
a	
respiratory	
disturbance	
have	
a	
greater	
propensity	
for	
obstructive	
events	
.	

Menopause	
is	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
this	
disorder	
in	
women	ORGANISM
,	
even	
after	
adjustment	
for	
age	
and	
BMI	
.	

However	
,	
use	
of	
hormone	
replacement	
therapy	
may	
be	
protective	
.	

There	
are	
conflicting	
data	
concerning	
smoking	
as	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
OSA	
.	

Various	
abnormalities	
of	
the	
bony	
and	
soft	TISSUE
tissue	TISSUE
structures	TISSUE
of	
the	
head	CANCER
and	CANCER
neck	CANCER
may	
predispose	
the	
individual	
to	
having	
OSA	
.	

These	
may	
be	
hereditary	
(	
e.g.	
,	
mandibular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
size	
,	
mandibular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
position	
,

)	
or	
acquired	
(	
e.g.

and

)	
.	

Endocrine	
disorders	
such	
as	
acromegaly	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
and	
hypothy-

are	
risk	
factors	
for	
OSA	
.	

Adults	
and	
children	ORGANISM
with	
Down	
syndrome	
also	
have	
a	
high	
prevalence	
of	
OSA

OSA	
is	
common	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
some	
neurologic	
disorders	
that	
affect	
peripheral	
muscles	
,	
such	
as	
myotonic	
dystrophy	
.	

OSA	
is	
likely	
made	
worse	
following	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
consumption	
or	
use	
of	
sedating	
medications	
before	
sleep	
and	
by

due	
to

Patterns	
OSA	
is	
a	
heritable	
condition	
as	
demonstrated	
by

of	
OSA	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

First

with	
OSA	
such	
as	
snoring

daytime

,

snorting

also	
occurs	
.	

Heritability	
explains	
approximately	
one	
third	
of	
the	
variation	
in	
the	
AHI	
,	
with	
a	
substantial	
proportion	
of	
the	
heritability	
explained	
by	
obesity	
.	

Other	
inherited	
traits	
that	
might	
predispose	
an	
indi-	
vidual	
to	
developing	
OSA	
include	
craniofacial	
morphology	
and	
ventilatory

.	

Familial	
environmental	
factors	
such	
as	
physical	
activity	
and	
eating	
habits	
may	
play	
a	
role	
as	
well	
.	

Nevertheless	
,	
genetic

to	
date	
have	
not	
identified	
a	
unique	
gene	
or

responsible	
for	
OSA

.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
As	
documented	
in	
longitudinal	
population	
studies	
,	
the	
severity	
of	
untreated	
OSA	
mea-	
sured	
by	
the	
AHI	
tends	
to	
slowly	
progress	
over	
time	
.	

OSA	
becomes	
more	
severe	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
whose	
BMI	
increases	
,	
but	
may	
improve	
with	
weight	
reduction	
.	

However	
,	
the	
effect	
of	
weight	
gain	
on	
increasing	
OSA	
severity	
is	
greater	
than	
the	
impact	
of	
weight	
loss	
on	
decreasing	
OSA	
severity	
.	

Moreover	
,	
the	
consequences	
of	
weight	
change	
are	
more	
evident	
in	
men	ORGANISM
than	
women	ORGANISM
.	

Substantial	
evidence	
implicates	
OSA	
as	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
incident	
systemic	
hyper-	
tension	
,	
coronary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
,	
congestive	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
,	
stroke	
,	
and	
premature

.	

Data	
suggest	
that	
these	
effects	
are	
more	
evident	
in	
men	ORGANISM
and	
middle	
-	
aged	
individuals	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
there	
is	
accumulating	
evidence	
to	
suggest	
that	
OSA	
is	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
type	
2	
diabetes	
mellitus	
independent	
of	
obesity	
.	

Various	
arrhythmias	
are	
commonly	
observed	
in	
association	
with	
OSA	
.	

Evidence	
suggests	
that	
OSA	
is	
particularly	
related	
to	
the	
onset	
and	
recurrence	
of	
atrial	
fibrillation	
.	

OSA	
may	
increase	
the	
severity	
of	
depression	
.	

Because	
of	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
func-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
tional	
impairment	
occurs	
commonly	
as	
manifested	
by	
poor	
job	
performance	
,	
loss	
of	
employment	
,	
impaired	
family	
relationships	
,	
and	
reduction	
in	
overall	
quality	
of	
life	
.	

The	
risk	
of	
motor	
vehicle	
accidents	
is	
significantly	
increased	
among	
those	
with	
OSA	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
OSA	
can	
occur	
in	
any	
age	
group	
,	
but	
in	
adults	
,	
prevalence	
accelerates	
between	
young	
adulthood	
and	
middle	
age	
,	
with	
a	
plateau	
reached	
after	
approximately	
age	
65	
years	
.	

Although	
OSA	
occurs	
in	
the	
elderly	
,	
it	
is	
commonly	
observed	
with	
few	
symptoms	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
some	
evidence	
suggests	
that	
risk	
of	
cardiovascular	
disease	
related	
to	
OSA	
may	
be	
less	
important	
in	
the	
elderly	
.	

This	
has	
raised	
the	
possibility	
that	
its	
presence	
in	
this	
age	
group	
represents	
a	
distinct	
clinical	
variant	
.	

Pediatric	
OSA	
is	
discussed	
in	
a	
separate

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
underlying	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
narrowing	
during	
sleep	
is	
multifactorial	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
commonly	
have	
reduced	
cross	
-	
sectional	
area	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
lumen	
due	
to	
either	
excessive	
bulk	
of	
soft	TISSUE
tissues	TISSUE
(	
tongue	ORGAN

and

or	
craniofacial

,	
or	
both	
.	

During	
inspiration	
,	
negative	
pressure	
is	
generated	
in	
the	
lumen	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
of	
the	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
,	
promoting	
closure	
.	

However	
,	
pharyngeal	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
dilating	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
muscles	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
act	
to	
maintain	
patency	
.	

The	
activity	
of	
these	
muscles	ORGAN
decreases	
with	
sleep	
onset	
,	
but	
is	
normally	
adequate	
to	
maintain	
an	
open	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
.	

In	
persons	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
,	
the	
activity	
of	
the	
pharyngeal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
dilating	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
muscles	ORGAN
becomes	
insufficient	
to	
prevent	
narrow-	
ing	
and/or	
closure	
of	
the	
upper	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
airway	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
.	

This	
state	
-	
dependent	
change	
is	
the	
major	
con-	
tributing	
factor	
leading	
to	
an	
obstructed	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
.	

There	
is	
a	
further	
reduction	
in	
tone	
and	
phasic	
activity	
of	
pharyngeal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
dilating	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
muscles	ORGAN
during	
REM

particularly	
in

which	
likely	
contributes	
to

Some

have	
unstable	
ventilatory	
control	
(	
high

)	
with	
resulting	
periods	
of	
hypocapnia	
that	
may	
also	
contribute	
to	
upper

narrowing	
.	

The	
mechanisms	
of	
apnea	
/	
hypopnea	
termination	
are	
controversial	
.	

Event	
termination	
may	
occur	
with	
or	
without	
an	
associated	
arousal	
.	

Some	
events	
may	
resolve	
with	
aug-	
mentation	
of	
upper	
airway	TISSUE
muscle	TISSUE
tone	
from	
chemical	
(	
low

,	
high

)	
and	
mechanical	
(

mechanoreceptors	CANCER
)	
stimuli	
,	
whereas	
others	
may	
depend	
on	
a	
change	
of	
sleep	
state	
(	
arousal	
)	
at	
either	
a	
cortical	CELL
or	
subcortical	CANCER
level	
.	

Cortical	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
arous-	
als	
are	
associated	
with	
changes	
detectable	
by	
EEG	
,	
whereas	
other	
changes	
of	
state	
may	
be	
detectable	
only	
by	
direct	
or	
indirect	
measures	
of	
sympathetic	
tone	
.	

Even	
if	
arousals	
are	
not	
required	
for	
termination	
of	
all	
obstructive	
events	
,	
sleep	
fragmentation	
from	
arousals	
is	
nevertheless	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
significant	
cause	
of	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

Apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
typically	
last	
considerably	
longer	
in	
REM	
and	
,	
in	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
are	
only	
present	
in	
this	
sleep	
stage	
.	

The	
explanation	
for	
this	
finding	
is	
unknown	
.	

As	
an	
apnea	
or	
hypopnea	
event	
progresses	
,	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
gradually	
becomes	
more	
hypox-	
emic	
;	
the	
degree	
of	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
is	
dependent	
not	
only	
on	
the	
duration	
of	
the

,	
but	
also	
on	
the	
patient	ORGANISM

oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

and	
lung	ORGAN
volume	
and	
the	
presence	
of

Slight

also	
occurs	
during

and	
is	
worse	
during	
REM

Objective	
Findings	
Obstructive	
apneas	
are	
documented	
by	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
with	
ongoing	
respiratory	
efforts	
during	
PSG	
or	
an	
OCST	
.	

When	
breathing	
effort	
is	
recorded	
with	
respiratory	
inductance	
plethysmography	
,	
it	
typically	
shows	
paradoxical	
movement	
of	
the	
rib	ORGAN
cage	
and	
abdomen	ORGAN
.	

If	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
manometry	
is	
used	
,	
increasingly	
large	
swings	
between	
inspiratory	
and	
expiratory	
efforts	
are	
observed	
.	

Obstructive	
hypopneas	
are	
a	
reduction	
rather	
than	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
with	
ongoing	
respiratory	
effort	
.	

Increasing	
respira-	
tory	
effort	
with	
constant	
or	
reduced	
flow	
is	
indicative	
of	
increased

This	
state	
is	
most	
accurately	
identified	
with	
a	
quantitative	
measurement	
of

and	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
manometry	
,	
although	
it	
can	
be	
inferred	
when

Although

,	
they	
may	
also	
have	
variable

period	
of

or

,	
with	
the

usually	
occurring	
after

The

As	
a	
result

some

meet	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for

These

These

are	
presumed	
to	
have	
the	
same	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
as	
obstructive	
apneas

hypopneas	
(

indicating

immediately	
preceding	
the

Microphones	
may	
record	
a	
sudden

Obstructive	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
may	
be	
accompanied	
by	
bradyarrhythmias	
,	
tachyarrhythmias	
,	
or	
both	
;	
however	
,	
the	
prevalence	
of

varies	
widely	
.	

At	
the	
time	
of

.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

In	
contrast	
to	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
,	
those	
with	
isolated	
snoring	
will	
not	
exhibit	
obstruc-	
tive	
apneas	
,	
hypopneas	
,	
or	
RERAs	
on	
PSG	
or	
OCST	
and	
do	
not	
have	
other	
sleep	
symp-	
toms	ORGANISM
attributable	
to	
breathing	
disturbance	
.	

However	
,	
because	
arousal	
-	
based	
hypopneas	
and	
RERAs	
can	
not	
be	
identified	
with	
OCST	CANCER
,	
OSA	
can	
not	
be	
excluded	
if	
the	
OCST	
is	
negative	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
central	
sleep	
apnea	
have	
predominantly	
central	
rather	
than	
obstruc-	
tive	
apneas	
,	
hypopneas	
,	
or	
RERAs	
as	
the	
primary	
finding	
on	
PSG	
or	
OCST	
.	

If	
mixed	
apneas	
are	
predominant	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	
should	
be	
made	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
obesity	
hypoventilation	
syndrome	
will	
demonstrate	
daytime	
hypercap-	
nia	
.	

Snoring	
may	
not	
be	
a	
prominent	
feature	
,	
although	
daytime	
sleepiness	
can	
occur	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
disorders	
may	
show	
episodes	
of	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
without	
evidence	
of	
airflow	
obstruction	
on	
PSG	
or	
OCST	
.	

Confirmation	
of	
nocturnal	
hypercapnia	
will	
be	
diagnostic	
.	

However	
,	
if	
obstructive	
apneas	
or	
hypo-	
pneas	
are	
evident	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	
should	
be	
made	
instead	
of	
,	
or	
in	
addition	
to	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
.	

OSA	
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
sleepiness	
such	
as	
narcolepsy	
,	
idio-	
pathic	
hypersomnia	
,	
and	
insufficient	
sleep	
.	

These	
conditions	
often	
can	
be	
identified	
on	
the	
basis	
of	
history	
,	
but	
PSG	
and/or	
MSLT	
may	
be	
required	
to	
confirm	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

OSA	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
nocturnal	
dyspnea	
,	
such	
as	
noc-	
turnal	
panic	
attacks	
,	
nocturnal	
gastroesophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
reflux	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
asthma	
,	
paroxysmal	
nocturnal	
dyspnea	
from	
congestive	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
,	
and	
nocturnal	
angina	
pectoris	
.	

In	
many	
cases	
,	
absence	
of	
snoring	
and	
daytime	
sleepiness	
will	
be	
highly	
suggestive	
of	
etiologies	
other	
than	
OSA	
.	

However	
,	
the	
absence	
of	
obstructive	
apneas	
,	
hypopneas	
,	
or	
RERAs	
on	
PSG	
will	
definitively	
exclude	
OSA	
as	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Although	
substantial	
evidence	
implicates	
OSA	
as	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
coronary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
and	
stroke	
,	
it	
has	
not	
been	
clearly	
demonstrated	
that	
treatment	
mitigates	
this	
risk	
.	

This	
is	
especially	
a	
concern	
for	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
mild	
OSA	
who	
are	
not	
hypersom-	
nolent	
.	

The	
pathophysiologic	
mechanisms	
linking	
OSA	
to	
increased	
risk	
of	
coronary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
,	
stroke	
,	
and	
hypertension	
require	
further	
investigation	
.	

Although	
there	
Sleep

Sleep	
Related

is	
a	
clear	
association	
between	
OSA	
and

,	
further	
studies	
are	
needed	
to	
determine	
whether	
OSA	
is	
an	
independent	
risk	
factor	
and	
what	
mechanisms	
are	
involved

OSA	
is	
characterized

,

,	
or	
both	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
may	
demonstrate	
several	
breathing	
patterns	
during	
sleep	
.	

Some	
children	ORGANISM
have	
cyclic	
episodes	
of	
obstructive	
apnea	
,	
similar	
to	
that	
of	
adults	
with	
the	
syndrome	
.	

However	
,	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
particularly	
younger	
children	ORGANISM
,	
have	
a	
pattern	
of	
obstructive	
hypoventilation	
,	
which	
consists	
of	
long	
periods	
of	
persistent	
partial	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
obstruction	
associated	
with	
hypercapnia	
,	
arterial	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desatu-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
ration	
,	
or	
both	
.	

Some	
children	ORGANISM
may	
manifest	
a	
pattern	
of	
UARS	
similar	
to	
that	
seen	
in	
adults	
,	
including	
snoring	
without	
identifiable	
airflow	
obstruction	
and	
increasingly	
negative	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
pressure	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
swings	
and	
cyclic	
arousals	
.	

In	
children	ORGANISM
,	
upper	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
airway	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
obstruction	
occurs	
predominantly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
often	
do	
not	
have	
cor-	
tical	
arousals	
in	
response	
to	
the	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
obstruction	
,	
although	
they	
may	
have	
movement	
or	
autonomic	
arousals	
.	

Perhaps	
as	
a	
result	
of	
this	
higher	
arousal	
threshold	
,	
sleep	
architecture	
is	
usually	
normal	
,	
with	
normal	
amounts	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

Even	
short	
obstructive	
apneas	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
severe	
hypoxemia	
because	
children	ORGANISM
have	
a	
lower	
functional	
residual	
capacity	
and	
a	
higher	
metabolic	
rate	
than	
adults	
.	

Most	
children	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
present	
with	
a	
history	
of	
snoring	
and	
difficulty	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
.	

Snoring	
is	
usually	
loud	
and	
may	
be	
punctuated	
by	
pauses	
and	
gasps	
,	
with	
associated	
movements	
or	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
particu-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
larly	
infants	
and	
those	
with	
neuromuscular	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
weakness	
,	
may	
not	
snore	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
obstructive	
hypoventilation	
often	
have	
continuous	
snoring	
without	
pauses	
or	
arous-	
als	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
have	
a	
very	
compliant	
rib	
cage	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
paradoxical	
breathing	
is	
a	
prominent	
sign	
in	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
(	
note	
that	
paradoxical	
breathing	
during	
REM	
sleep	
is	
a	
normal	
phenomenon	
in	
young	
children	ORGANISM
up	
to	
at	
least	
age	
three	
years	
)	
.	

A	
pectus	
excavatum	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Thoracic	
retractions	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
may	
sleep	
in	
unusual	
positions	
,	
such	
as	
seated	
or	
with	
their	
neck	
hyperextended	
.	

Diaphoresis	
may	
be	
observed	
.	

Morning	
headaches	
may	
also	
occur	
.	

Many	
parents	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
are	
so	
concerned	
about	
their	
child	
’s	
breathing	
that	
they	
sleep	
with	
their	
child	
or	
stimu-	
late	
their	
child	
to

been	
estimated	
at	
1	
%	
to	
4	
%	
,	
but	
the	
prevalence	
may	
currently

In

Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
exact	
course	
of	
pediatric	
OSA	
has	
not	
been	
well	
studied	
.	

Symptoms	
typically	
begin	
within	
the	
first	
few	
years	
of	
life	
,	
although	
the	
disease	
may	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
until	
many	
years	
later

The	
natural	
course	
of	
untreated	
OSA	
is	
not	
known

A	
few	
short

studies	
suggest	
that	
some	
children	ORGANISM
with	
mild	
disease	
may	
improve

conversely	
,	
have	
worsening	
of	
the

Complications	
are	
frequent	
and	
may	
be

OSA	
can	
cause	
growth

,	
especially	
when	
associated	
with	
a	
comorbid

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
In	
children	ORGANISM
,	
as	
in	
adults	
,	
OSA	
results	
from	
a	
combination	
of	
abnormal	
neuromuscular	TISSUE
control	
and	
anatomical	
narrowing	
of	
the	
collapsible	
(	
supracartilaginous	
)	
portion	
of	
the	
upper	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
airway	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
.	

During	
wakefulness	
,	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
compensates	
by	
augmenting	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
to	
dilate	
the	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
;	
thus	
,	
obstructive	
apnea	
does	
not	
occur	
.	

During	
sleep	
,	
there	
is	
a	
decrease	
in	
ventilatory	
drive	
and	
in	
neuromuscular	
tone	
,	
facilitating	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
collapse	
.	

The	
resultant	
recurrent	
hypoxemia	
,	
hypercapnia	
,	
and	
sleep	
disruption	
may	
lead	
to	
neurobehavioral	
,	
cardiovascular	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
,	
and	
growth	
abnor-	
malities	
.	

Childhood	
OSA	
has	
also	
been	
associated	
with	
metabolic	
and	
inflammatory	
abnormalities	
.	

In	
most	
children	ORGANISM
who	
are	
otherwise	
healthy	
,	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
narrowing	
is	
primarily	
due	
to	
adenotonsillar	
hypertrophy	
.	

Pediatric	
OSA	
also	
occurs	
in	
association	
with	
obesity	
,	
which	
is	
becoming	
increasingly	
prevalent	
.	

Other	
causes	
for	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
narrowing	
include	
craniofacial	
anomalies	
,	
particularly	
those	
involving	
midface	
hypoplasia	
or	
micrognathia	
/	
retrognathia	
.	

In

,	
children	ORGANISM
with	
decreased	
upper

Possibly	
as	
a	
result	
of	
the	
higher

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Pediatric

,	
daytime	
behavioral

or	
other	
symptoms

require	
further	
laboratory	
investigation	
.	

However	
,	
children	ORGANISM
who	
have	
snoring	
and	
symptoms	
of	
OSA	
need	
evaluation	
to	
deter-	
mine	
whether	
they	
have	
isolated	
snoring	
or	
OSA	
(	
N.B.	
this	
distinction	
can	
not	
reliably	
be	
made	
clinically	
but	
should	
be	
based	
on	
PSG	
)	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
with	
primary	
snoring	
do	
not	
have	
apneas	
,	
gas	
exchange	
abnormalities	
,	
or	
frequent	
arousals	
on	
PSG	
.	

Central	
sleep	
apnea	
can	
be	
differentiated	
from	
OSA	
by	
the	
lack	
of	
chest	
or	
abdominal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
wall	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
move-	
ment	
associated	
with	
the	
central	
apneas	
.	

Mixed	
apneas	
may	
be	
seen	
and	
are	
included	
in	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
with	
fixed	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
obstruction	
due	
to	
struc-	
tural	
abnormalities	
tend	
to	
obstruct	
both	
awake	
and	
asleep	
,	
and	
have	
stridor	
rather	
than	
snoring	
.	

OSA	
in	
children	ORGANISM
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
nonobstructive	
alveolar	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
hypoventilation	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
with	
lung	ORGAN
or	
chest	
wall	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
may	
have	
desaturation	
and	
hypercapnia	
during	
sleep	
.	

It	
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
separate	
nonobstructive	
hypoventila-	
tion	
and	
desaturation	
from	
OSA	
,	
especially	
because	
the	
two	
conditions	
may	
coexist	
.	

In	
general	
,	
children	ORGANISM
with	
nonobstructive	
hypoventilation	
will	
not	
snore	
and	
will	
not	
have	
paradoxical	
inward	
rib	
cage	
motion	
during	
inspiration	
,	
although	
the	
latter	
may	
be	
present	
in	
children	ORGANISM

Sleep

Unresolved

Further	
Directions	

There	
is	
a	
need	
for	
further

aspects	
of

OSA	
.	

Although	
studies	
of	
prevalence	
have	
been	
performed	
in	
the	
past	
,	
the	
prevalence	
has	
probably	
increased	
in	
recent	
years	
due	
to	
the	
increasing

Some

have	
a

A	
diagnosis	
of	
CSA

requires	
that

be	
predom-

with	
an	
average	
frequency	
of

For	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
mixture	
of

CSA	
-	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
the	
central	
apneas	
may	
appear	
only	
after	
elimination	
of

.	

In	
patient	ORGANISM
with	
CSA

CSB	
,	
arousal	
from

tends	
to	
occur	
at	
the	
zenith	
of	
respiratory	
effort	
between	
contiguous	
central	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	
.	

This	
can	
result	
in	
sleep

.	

However	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
complain	
of	
disturbed	
nocturnal	
sleep	
or	
nocturnal

rather	
than	
daytime	
sleepiness

Associated	
Features	
Presenting

may	
include	
excessive

or	
nocturnal

.	

Because	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
CSA	
-	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
have	
known	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
,	
their	
complaints	
of

may	
be	
falsely	
assumed	
to	
be	
entirely	
secondary	
to	
heart	ORGAN

.	

Because	
studies	
have	
shown	
that	
approximately	
60	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
have	
some	
form	
of	
sleep	
apnea	
,	
a	
high	
index	
of	
suspicion	
is	
indicated	
.	

A	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
pattern	
can	
also	
occur	
during	
wakefulness	
and	
can	
be	
observed	
at	
bedside	
or	
in	
the	
clinic	
.	

Some	
studies	
suggest	
that	
the	
pres-	
ence	
of	
CSA	
-	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
during	
wakefulness	
is	
associated	
with	
a

Although	
heart	ORGAN

is	
the	
major	
cause	
of	
CSA	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
CSB	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
recent	
studies	
suggest	
that	
it	
can	
be	
noted	
after

CSA	
-	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
can	
rarely	
present	
in	
an	
idiopathic	
form	
or	
be	
associated	
with	
renal	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
failure	
.	

As	
in	
other	
forms	
of	
CSA	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
are	
associated	
with	
absent	
or	
reduced	
ventilatory	
effort	
,	
respectively	
,	
due	
to	
diminished	
central	
respiratory	
drive	
.	

Of	
inter-	
est	
,	
a	
longer	
respiratory	
phase	
between	
apneas	
is	
associated	
with	
a	
longer	
circulation	
time	
and	
delay	
in	
the	
saturation	
nadir	
.	

The	
CSB	
breathing	
pattern	
is	
characteristically	
observed	
during	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
and	
usually	
resolves	
or	
is	
attenuated	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

In	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
both	
OSA	
and	
CSA	
-	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
the	
relative	
amount	
of	
central	
and	
obstructive

can	
vary	
over	
time	
or	
even	
within	
the	
same	
night	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
combined	
OSA	
and	
CSA	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
and	
the	
CSA

These	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
considered	
to	
have	
both	
OSA	
and	
CSA	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
systolic	
or

may	
have

but	
the

is	
longer	
in	
those

.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with

Demographics	
CSA

generally	
is

in	
subjects	
older

The	
prevalence	
of	
this

in	
the	
setting	
of	
chronic	
congestive	
heart	ORGAN

has	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
25	
%	
to	
40

,	
depending	
on	
how	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
divided	
into	
those	
with

and	
those	
with

in	
the	
first

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
most	
important	
predisposing	
factors	
are	
the	
presence	
of	
congestive	
heart	ORGAN

,	
stroke	
,	
and	
possibly	
renal	ORGAN

.	

Within

,	
risk	
factors	
for

pattern	
during	
sleep	
include	
male	
sex	
,	
age	
older	
than	
60	
years	
,	
the	
presence	
of

hypocapnia	
(	
i.e.	
,	
awake	
PaCO2	
of

greater	
pulmonary	ORGAN
congestion	
(	
higher	
left	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE

)	
predicts

.	

Some	
studies	
suggest	
that	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
occurs	
more	
commonly	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
.	

Although

Developmental	
Issues	

Although	
there	
are	
reports	
of	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
in	
children	ORGANISM
,	
the	
condition	
is	
extremely	
rare	
in	
this	
age	
group	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
one	
study	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
congestive	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
across	
all	
age	
groups	
found	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
to	
be	
absent	
in	
children	ORGANISM
but	
present	
in	
40	
%	
of	
the	
adult	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
congestive	
heart	ORGAN

.	

A	
limitation	
of	
the	
study	
was	
that	
only	
ten

were

.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
CSA	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
generally	
arises	
because	
of	
instability	
in	
the	
respiratory	
control	
system	
.	

A	
high	
ventilatory	
drive	
and	
delay	
in	
chemoreceptor	CELL
response	
to	
changes	
of	
PaCO2	
and	
PaO2	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
(	
due	
to	
increased	
circulation	
time	
)	
are	
likely	
the	
major	
factors	
.	

This	
breathing	
disorder	
tends	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
chronically	
low	
PaCO2	
when	
awake	
and	
asleep	
.	

Hyperventilation	
occurs	
due	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
responsiveness	
of	
the	
periph-	
eral	
and	
central	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
chemoreceptors	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
.	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM

The	
increased	
responsiveness	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
to	
both	
increased	
sympathetic	
tone	
and	
stimulation	
of	
vagal	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
irritant	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
receptors	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
in	
the	
lungs	ORGAN
by	
pulmonary	ORGAN
congestion	
.	

The	
PaCO2	
in	
individuals	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
pattern	
and	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
is	
closer	
to	
their	
apneic	
threshold	
than	
in	
those	
without	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
pattern	
(	
primarily	
due	
to	
a	
smaller	
sleep	
related	
rise	
in	
PaCO2	
in	
those	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
)	
,	
so	
that	
even	
modest	
increases	
in	
ventilation	
can	
drive	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

The	
most	
common	
trigger	
factor	
for	
central	
apnea	
is	
an	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
,	
which	
abruptly	
augments	
ventilation	
and	
drives	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

The	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
tidal	TISSUE
volume	
results	
from	
prolonged	
lung	ORGAN
-	
to	
-	
che-	
moreceptor	
circulatory	
delay	
,	
such	
that	
changes	
in	
PaCO2	
in	
the	
lung	ORGAN
are	
trans-	
mitted	
only	
very	
slowly	
to	
the	
chemoreceptors	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
gradual	
buildup	
and	
falloff	
of	
ventilatory	
stimulation	
.	

The	
length	
of	
the	
cycle	
is	
directly	
proportional	
to	
lung	ORGAN
-	
to	
-	
chemoreceptor	
circulation	
time	
and	
inversely	
proportional	
to	
cardiac	ORGAN
output	
.	

Accordingly	
,	
whereas	
the	
length	
of	
the	
ventilatory	
-	
apneic	
cycle	
in	
primary	
CSA	
is	
typically	
shorter	
than	
40	
seconds	
,	
in	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
pattern	
it	
is	
almost	
invariably	
longer	
than	
40	
seconds	
(	
usually	
45	
-	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

One	
study	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
varying	
degrees	
of	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
found	
a	
considerably	
shorter	
cycle	
time	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
normal	
ejection	
frac-	
tion	
(	
e.g.

The	
pathophysiology	
of	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
pattern	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
stroke	
and	
renal	ORGAN
failure	
has	
not	
been	
examined	
in	
any	
detail	
.	

However	
,	
apneas	
in	
association	
with	
these	
medical	
disorders	
are	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
to	
a	
reduction	
in	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

In	
individuals	
with	
renal	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
failure	
,	
pulmonary	ORGAN
congestion	
(	
volume	
overload	
)	
may	
play	
a

Objective	
Findings

are	
recurrent

In

N3	
sleep	
the

PaCO2	
is	
higher	
(

During	
REM	
sleep	
the	
hypoxic	
and	
hypercapnic	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
ventila-	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
tory	
responses	
are	
lower	
,	
thereby	
reducing	
the	
tendency	
for	
an	
overshoot	
in	
ventilation	
which	
may	
drive	
PaCO2	
below	
the

As	
noted	
above	
,	
a	
longer	
respiratory	
phase	
(	
and	
cycle	
length	
)	
is	
associated	
with	
lower	
cardiac	ORGAN
output	
and	
longer	
circulation	
time	
.	

Central	
hypopnea	
,	
rather	
than	
apnea	
,	
can	
occur	
at	
the	
nadir	
in	
respiratory	
effort	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
and	
have	
been	
included	
in	
calculation	
of	
the	
central	
AHI	
in	
a	
sub-	
stantial	
number	
of	
investigations	
.	

Central	
hypopneas	
are	
characterized	
by	
the	
absence	
of	
snoring	
,	
flattening	
in	
the	
nasal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
pressure	
or	
PAP	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
device

,	
and	
thoracoab-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
dominal	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
paradox	
.	

Central	
apneas	
and	
central	
hypopneas	
are	
usually	
accompanied	
by	
modest	
oxyhemo-	
globin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
desaturation	
;	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
oxygen	
saturation	
seldom	
falls	
below	
80	
%	
to	
85	
%	
.	

The	
combination	
of	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
and	
arousals	
from	
sleep	
leads	
to	
sleep	
fragmenta-	
tion	
with	
reduced	
amounts	
of	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

Additionally	
,	
PaCO2	
less	
than	
40	

mm	
Hg	
is	
typically	
observed	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

In	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
both	
obstructive	
and	
central	
apneas	
,	
the	
proportion	
of	
central	
apneas	
tends	
to	
increase	
over	
the	
night	
,	
and	
this	
is

Disorders	
Sleep	
Related

Disorders	
associated	
with	
a	
fall	
in	
the	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
.	

The	
lower	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
due	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
pulmonary	ORGAN
congestion	
during	
the	
night	
with	
stimulation	
of	
juxta-	TISSUE

receptors	
in	
the	
lung	TISSUE
interstitium	TISSUE
and	
a	
subsequent	
increase	
in	
ventilatory

.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
more	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Primary	
CSA	
can	
usually	
be	
distinguished	
from	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
pattern	
by	
the	
absence	
of	
a	
history	
of	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
,	
stroke	
,	
or	
renal	ORGAN
failure	
and	
by	
the	
absence	
of	
a	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
breathing	
pattern	
between	
central	
apneas	
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
(	
apnea	
+	
ventilatory	
phase	
)	
in	
primary	
CSA	
is	
typically	
less	
than	
40	
seconds	
.	

High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
only	
occurs	
at	
high	
altitude	
and	
is	
not	
associated	
with	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
,	
stroke	
,	
or	
renal	ORGAN
failure	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
CSA	
due	
to	
drug	
or	
substance	
have	
a	
history	
of	
use	
of	
this	
type	
of	
medication	
,	
and	
an	
ataxic	
breathing	
pattern	
may	
be	
present	
.	

If	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
CSA	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
opioids	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
manifest	
periodic	
breathing	
,	
the	
respiratory	
phase	
does	
not	
have	
a	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
and	
the	
cycle	
length	
is	
shorter	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
CSA	
due	
to	
a	
medical	
or	
neurological	
disease	
without	
Cheyne

will	
have	
central

that	
does	
not	
have

as	
the	
name	
implies

Sleep	
related	
hypoven-	
tilation	
and	
hypoxemic	
syndromes	
can	
be	
readily	
distinguished	
from	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
by	
documentation	
of	
an	
awake	
PaCO2	
>	

45	
mm	

Hg	
and/or	
sleep

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
usually	
have	
an	
awake	
PaCO2	
<

In	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
disorders	
,	
some	
central

may	
be	
present	
,	
but	
these

do	
not	
have	
a	
Cheyne

morphology	
.	

Additionally	
,	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
in	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
syndromes	
is	
generally	
more	
pronounced	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

OSA	
is	
distinguished	
by	
the	
presence	
of	
respiratory	
efforts	
during	
apneas	
.	

A	
few	
central	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	
at	
sleep	
onset	
or	
during	
REM

are	
normal	
,

are	
listed

.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
and	
demographics	
of	
this	
disorder	
vary	
with	
the	
underlying	
etiology	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
Chiari	
malformation	
(	
CM	
)	
can	
present	
in	
infancy	
or	
childhood	
,	
but	
the	
most	
common	
age	
of	
presentation	
is	
20	
to	
40	
years	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
stroke	
tend	
to	
be	
older	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Because	
of	
the	
heterogeneity	
of	
etiologies	
in	
this	
type	
of	
CSA	
,	
predisposing	
and	
pre-	
cipitating	
factors	
are	
variable	
.	

In	
CM	
there	
is	
herniation	
of	
a

CSA	
in	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
is	
believed	
to	
occur	
due	
to	
impaired	
function	
of	
ventilatory	
control	
centers	
in	
the

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
These	
factors	
vary	
as	
well	
with	
the	
different	
etiologies	
.	

In	
CM	
the	
presentation	
is	
typi-	
cally	
age	
20	
to	
40	
years	
of	
age	
but	
can	
occur	
in	
infants	
and	
children	ORGANISM
.	

With	
the	
increased	
use	
of	
magnetic	
resonance	
imaging	
(	
MRI	
)	
,	
cases	
are	
often	
diagnosed	
before	
symptoms	
are	
severe	
.	

The	
CSA	
following	
a	
cerebrovascular	
accident	
(	
CVA	
)	
is	
abrupt	
in	
onset	
.	

In	
patients	ORGANISM
exhibiting	
both	
central	
and	
obstructive	
apnea	
,	
the	
central	
apneas	
tend	
to	
resolve	
with	
time	
.	

Some	
post	
-	
CVA	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
central	
apneas	
have	
central	
apnea	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
whereas	
in	
others	
the	
CSA	
does	
not	
have	
a	
pattern	
consistent	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

The	
central	
apneas	
can	
lead	
to	
sleep	
fragmentation	
,	
yielding	
either	
hypersomnolence	
or	
insomnia	
or	
both	
.	

There	
is	
little	
evidence	
that	
these	
apneas	
or	
their	
associated	
hypoxia	
and	
hypercapnia	
lead	
to	
pulmonary	ORGAN
hypertension	
,	
cor	
pulmonale	
,	
or	
other	
adverse	
car-	
diovascular	
consequences	
.	

Developmental

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
CSA	
is	
caused	
by	
failure	
of	
the

.	

The	
abnormality	
is	
due	
to	
dysfunction	
of

Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
Essential	
Features	
High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
characterized	
by	
alternating	
periods	
of	
central	
apnea	
and	
hyperpnea	
associated	
with	
recent	
ascent	
to	
high	
altitude	
.	

The	
pattern	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
an	
expected	
response	
to	
ascent	
to	
elevation	
.	

Only	
those	
individuals	
who	
manifest	
related	
symptoms	
,	
as	
described	
below	
,	
are	
diagnosed	
with	
this	
disorder	
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
of	
this	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
commonly	
less	
than	
40	
seconds	
and	
often	
as	
short	
as	
12	
to	
20	
seconds	
.	

The	
percentage	
of	
individuals	
exhibiting	
periodic	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
increases	
at	
higher	
altitudes	
.	

Approximately	
25	
%	
exhibit	
periodic	
breath-	
ing	
at	
2,500	
meters	
(	
8,202	
feet	
)	
,	
and	
virtually	
100	
%	
demonstrate	
periodic	
breathing	
at	
4,000	
m	
(	
13,123	
feet	
)	
.	

Periodic	
breathing	
has	
been	
described	
at	
altitudes	
as	
low	
as	
1,500	
meters	
(	
4,900	
feet	
)	
.	

Chronic	
exposure	
to	
altitude	
above	
2,500	
meters	
has	
also	
been	
associated	
with	
periodic	
breathing	
in	
some	
studies	
.	

Associated	
Features	
At	
altitude	
,	
individuals	
may	
complain	
of	
frequent	
awakenings	
,	
poor	
-	
quality	
sleep	
,	
and	
a	
sense	
of	
dyspnea	
.	

These	
symptoms	
will	
often	
improve	
with	
time	
at	
moderate	
altitude	
but	
may	
persist	
at	
extreme	
altitude	
.	

Alterations	
in	
sleep	
associated	
with	
ascent	
to	
alti-	
tude	
include	
a	
reduction	
in	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
and	
increased	
arousal	
frequency	
.	

Total	
sleep	
time	
and	
the	
amount	
of	
REM	
sleep	
are	
either	
unchanged	
or	
decreased	
.	

Of	
note	
,	
the	
degree	
of	
both	
subjective	
and	
objective	
impairment	
of	
sleep	
quality	
was	
not	
correlated	
with	
the	
severity	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
in	
a	
number	
of	
studies	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
None	
known	
.	

Demographics	
The	
demographics	
of	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
are	
not	
known	
.	

High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
tends	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
high	
hypoxic	
and	
probably	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
response	
.	

Because	
men	ORGANISM
generally	
have	
higher	
chemorespon-	
siveness	
than	
women	ORGANISM
,	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
may	
be	
more	
common	
in	
men	ORGANISM
than	
in	
women	ORGANISM
.	

As	
stated	
above	
,	
periodic	
breathing	
will	
occur	
in	
virtually	
anyone	
ascending	
to	
higher	
than	
4,000	
meters	
and	
in	
some	
individuals	
at	
lower	
altitudes	
.	

The	
latter	
group	
probably	
comprises	
individuals	
with	
increased	
hypoxic	
chemoresponsive-	

ness	
.	

In	
one	
study	
,	
individuals	
both	
with	
and	
without	
periodic	
breathing	
at	
altitude	
had	
alterations	
in	
sleep	
architecture	
.	

Those	
with	
periodic	
breathing	
had	
a	
greater	
arousal	
index	
,	
although	
their	
sleep	
architecture	
was	
otherwise	
not	
significantly	
different	
from	
individuals	ORGANISM
who	
did	
not	
develop	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
only	
known	
predisposing	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
increased	
ventilatory	
chemoresponsiveness	
,	
primarily	
hypoxic	
ventila-	
tory	
responsiveness	
.	

A	
high	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
will	
lead	
to	
increased	
hyper-	
ventilation	
on	
ascent	
to	
altitude	
.	

This	
hyperventilation	
leads	
to	
hypocapnic	
alkalosis	
that	
,	
during	
sleep	
,	
inhibits	
ventilation	
.	

Thus	
,	
repetitive	
cycles	
of	
apnea	
and	
hyperpnea	
develop	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

The	
obvious	
precipitating	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
this	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
ascent	
to	
altitude	
.	

The	
more	
rapid	
the	
ascent	
,	
the	
more	
likely	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
to	
develop	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

Some	
data	
suggest	
that	
ventilatory	
chemoresponsiveness	
is	
directly	
inherited	
.	

Because	
elevated	
hypoxic	
responsiveness	
is	
a	
predisposing	
variable	
in	
the	
development	
of	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
,	
it	
would	
seem	
likely	
that	
there	
would	
be	
a	
familial	
pattern	
in	
the	
development	
of	
this	
respiratory	
abnormality	
.	

However	
,	
there	
are	
no	
data	
addressing	
this	
issue	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
This	
respiratory	
pattern	
will	
generally	
be	
evident	
during	
sleep	
immediately	
after	
ascent	
to	
altitude	
.	

This	
depends	
to	
some	
extent	
on	
the	
rapidity	
of	
the	
ascent	
,	
the	
elevation	
,	
and	
individual	
predisposition	
.	

However	
,	
it	
will	
be	
present	
most	
often	
on	
the	
first	
night	
at	
altitude	
.	

At	
moderate	
altitude	
,	
the	
breathing	
pattern	
may	
become	
more	
regular	
over	
time	
,	
although	
at	
extreme	
altitude	
it	
is	
likely	
to	
persist	
.	

One	
recent	
study	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
continued	
to	
increase	
over	
three	
days	
to	
two	
weeks	
of	
acclimatization	
.	

Studies	
of	
adaptation	
to	
altitude	
suggest	
that	
sleep	
quality	
may	
improve	
despite	
further	
increases	
in	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
hypoxia	
itself	
may	
have	
an	
important	
role	
in	
disturbing	
sleep	
architecture	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
and	
symptoms	
may	
improve	
during	
acclimatization	
to	
altitude	
even	
if	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
actually	
increases	
.	

The	
complications	
of	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
,	
which	
are	
generally	
limited	
to	
disrupted	
sleep	
on	
the	
initial	
nights	
at	
altitude	
,	
include	
frequent	
awakenings	
,	
often	
with	
shortness	
of	
breath	
or	
a	
sensation	
of	
suffocation	
that	
may	
lead	
to	
fatigue	
or	
sleep-	
iness	
on	
the	
following	
day	
.	

There	
is	
no	
clear	
association	
between	
periodic	
breathing	
and	
other	
altitude	
syndromes	
(	
high	
-	
altitude	
pulmonary	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
edema	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
acute	
mountain	
sick-	

ness	
,	
and	
high	
-	
altitude	
cerebral	
edema	
)	
.	

In	
fact	
,	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
a	
marker	
of	
high	
hypoxic	
responsiveness	
,	
which	
generally	
yields	
improved	
oxygenation	
at	
altitude	
and	
a	
reduced	
frequency	
of	
the	
maladaptive	
syndromes	
.

Relatively	
little	
is	
known	
about	
differences	
between	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adults	
concerning	
periodic	
breathing	
at	
altitude	
.	

One	
study	
did	
compare	
breathing	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
their	
fathers	
.	

The	
children	ORGANISM
revealed	
reduced	
nocturnal	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
saturation	
and	
associated	
hyperventilation	
at	
high	
altitude	
similar	
to	
the	
adults	
,	
but	
their	
breathing	
pattern	
was	
more	
stable	
.	

The	
investigators	
hypothesized	
that	
children	ORGANISM
may	
have	
a	
lower

threshold	
for

than	
adults	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
product	
of	
the	
hyperventilation	
induced	
by	
the	
hypobaric	
hypoxia	
encountered	
at	
altitude	
.	

At	
2,500	
meters	
the	
atmo-	
spheric	
pressure	
is	
approximately	
570	
mm	
Hg	
and	
the	
ideal	
alveolar	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
PO2	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
around	
55	
mm	
Hg	
(	
depending	
on	
the	
level	
of	
PaCO2	
)	
.	

Actual	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
PO2	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
values	
will	
be	
lower	
,	
especially	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
shows	
a	
steep	
increase	
in	
ventilation	
when	
the	
arterial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
PO2	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
level	
drops	
below	
55	
mm	
Hg	
.	

The	
increases	
in	
venti-	
lation	
associated	
with	
hypoxemia	
result	
in	
hypocapnic	
alkalosis	
.	

Because	
PaCO2	
is	
the	
principal	
stimulus	
to	
respiration	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
,	
a	
low	
PaCO2	
can	
yield	
a	
loss	
or	
reduction	
in	
respiratory	
drive	
,	
resulting	
in	
central	
apnea	
or	
hypopnea	
.	

The	
greater	
the	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
hypoxia	
,	
the	
greater	
the	
fall	
in	
PaCO2	
.	

Thus	
,	
individuals	
with	
brisk	
hypoxic	
responses	
more	
commonly	
tend	
to	
demonstrate	
this	
respiratory	
pattern	
.	

Over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
apnea	
,	
the	
PaO2	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
falls	
and	
PaCO2	
rises	
,	
eventually	
stimulating	
a	
resumption	
of	
ventilation	
.	

However	
,	
after	
several	
large	
breaths	
,	
the	
PaCO2	
again	
falls	
below	
the	
apnea	
threshold	
,	
initiating	
another	
pause	
in	
breathing	
.	

This	
cycle	
is	
then	
repeated	
over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
night	
.	

Of	
note	
,	
the	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
often	
improved	
during	
REM	
sleep	
with	
reduced	
cycling	
.	

This	
is	
likely	
due	
to	
the	
decreased	
hypoxic	
and	
hypercapnic	
responsiveness	
characteristic	
of	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
in	
one	
study	
the	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
continued	
to	
increase	
up	
to	
seven	
days	
after	
ascent	
to	
altitude	
.	

This	
resulted	
in	
a	
lower	
PaCO2	
and	
higher	
PaO2	
.	

The	
reduction	
in	
peri-	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
odic	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
breathing	
in	
some	
individuals	
with	
adaptation	
to	
altitude	
despite	
a	
greater	
venti-	
latory	
response	
to	
hypoxemia	
may	
be	
due	
to	
a	
lowering	
of	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

Other	
studies	
have	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
continues	
to	
increase	
over	
three	
days	
to	
two	
weeks	
of	
acclimatization	
despite	
improvements	
in	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
saturation	
.	

The	
increase	
in	
both	
periodic	
breathing	
and	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
saturation	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
due	
to	
increased	
controller	
gain	
of	
the	
respiratory	
system	
.	

A	
number	
of	
studies	
have	
found	
that	
the	
impairment	
of	
sleep	
architecture	
does	
not	
correlate	
with	
the	
degree	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

One	
study	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
was	
greater	
on	
the	
third	
night	
at	
altitude	
compared	
to	
the	
first	
night	
.	

However	
,	
both	
the	
nocturnal	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
saturation	
and	
amount	
of	
stage	
N3	
also	
increased	
on	
the	
third	
night	
compared	
to	
the	
first	
night	
.	

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
hypoxia	
rather	
than	
periodic	
breathing	
might	
be	
the	
major	
factor	
disturbing	
sleep	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
The	
PSG	
of	
individuals	
with	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
demonstrates	
recur-	
rent	
central	
apneas	
with	
a	
cycle	
time	
of	
less	
than	
40	
seconds	
,	
and	
typically	
around	
20	
seconds	
.	

There	
is	
some	
degree	
of	
associated	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
oxygen	
desaturation	
.	

The	
apneas	
are	
short	
,	
generally	
8	
to	
10	
seconds	
in	
duration	
.	

In	
one	
study	
,	
the	
apnea	
duration	
was	
around	
8	
seconds	
(	
7	
to	
9	
seconds	
)	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
approximately	
12	
seconds	
(	
10	
-	
14	
seconds	
)	
in	
adults	
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
is	
commonly	
less	
than	
40	
seconds	
.	

This	
breathing	
pattern	
occurs	
only	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
with	
more	
rhythmic	
respiration	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Because	
this	
breathing	
pattern	
is	
a	
physiologic	
adaptation	
to	
altitude	
,	
there	
is	
no	
specific	
number	
of	
apneas	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
that	
is	
considered	
normal	
or	
abnormal	
.	

The	
apneas	
and	
associated	
hyperpnea	
can	
lead	
to	
recurrent	
arousals	
from	
sleep	
,	
which	
often	
increase	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
while	
reducing	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

REM	
sleep	
(	
stage	
R	
)	
duration	
is	
generally	
preserved	
,	
as	
is	
total	
sleep	
time	
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
some	
studies	
have	
found	
a	
reduction	
in	
total	
sleep	
time	
and	
stage	
R	
as	
well	
as	
stage	
N3	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
the	
arousal	
index	
was	
only	
around	
25	
%	
of	
the	
AHI	
in	
some	
investigations	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
SRBDs	
.	

The	
major	
distinguishing	
factor	
is	
,	
of	
course	
,	
recent	
ascent	
to	
high	
altitude	
.	

An	
individual	
with	
OSA	
will	
likely	
continue	
to	
have	
this	
nocturnal	
respiratory	
problem	
at	
altitude	
.	

Altitude	
might	
even	
exacerbate	
the	
OSA	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
chronic	
mountain	
sickness	
demonstrate	
relative	
hypoventilation	
at	
altitude	
(	
i.e.	
,	
breathe	
less	
than	
is	
encoun-	
tered	
in	
normal	
individuals	
at	
similar	
altitude	
)	
such	
that	
they	
are	
more	
hypoxic	
than	
normal	
individuals	ORGANISM
who	
have	
a	
greater	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
the	
same	
ambient	
hypoxia	
.	

During	
sleep	
,	
these	
individuals	
often	
demonstrate	
further	
arterial	AMINO_ACID
oxygen	AMINO_ACID
desaturation	AMINO_ACID
.	

Some	
of	
the	
individuals	
will	
demonstrate	
apneas	
or	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

A	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
mountain	
sickness	
does	
not	
imply	
that	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
present	
.	

However	
,	
periodic	
breathing	
may	
be	
more	
common	
in	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
than	
previously	
appreciated	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
Recent	
studies	
suggest	
that	
hypoxemia	
rather	
than	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
may	
be	
the	
major	
factor	
impairing	
sleep	
quality	
.	

Further	
studies	
relating	
changes	
in	
sleep	
and	
periodic	
breathing	
at	
altitude	
are	
needed

Essential	
Features	
Users	
of	
potent	
long	
-	
acting	
opioids	
may	
have	
central	
apneas	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
most	
common	
offending	
drug	
is	
methadone	
.	

However	
,	
the	
condition	
has	
also	
been	
described	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
taking	
long	
-	
acting	
forms	
of	
morphine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
or	
oxycodone	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
as	
well	
as	
individu-	
als	
being	
treated	
with	
fentanyl	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
patches	
or	
continuous	
narcotic	
infusions	
.	

Suboxone	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
(	
a	
combination	
of	
buprenorphine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
naloxone	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
)	
is	
often	
used	
for	
treatment	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcotic	
dependence	
and	
pain	
and	
can	
also	
cause	
drug	
-	
induced	
central	
apnea	
.	

The	
description	
of	
this	
population	
is	
complicated	
by	
the	
fact	
that	
many	
of	
the	
affected	
indi-	
viduals	
may	
be	
using	
multiple	
drugs	
(	
prescribed	
or	
illicit	
)	
that	
affect	
sleep	
and	
breathing	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Breathing	
abnormalities	
associated	
with	
these	
drugs	
are	
not	
restricted	
to	
central	
apneas	
and	
may	
also	
include	
hypoventilation	
and	
OSA	
with	
prolonged	
respiratory	
events	
.	

In	
fact	
,	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
present	
with	
a	
combination	
of	
both	
OSA	
and	
CSA	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
who	
have	
nocturnal	
hypoventilation	
may	
have	
normal	
or	
increased	
daytime	
PaCO2	
.	

In	
most	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
daytime	
hypoventilation	
,	
the	
PaCO2	
is	
only	
mildly	
increased	
(	
46	
-	
50	
mm	
Hg	
)	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
drug	
-	
induced	
central	
apnea	
who	
are	
being	
treated	
for	
chronic	
pain	
often	
report	
significant	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

Due	
to	
the	
sedating	
effects	
of	
opioid	
medications	
,	
the	
sleepiness	
may	
not	
substantially	
improve	
even	
if	
the	
central	
apnea	
is	
treated	
successfully	
.	

However	
,	
one	
study	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
on	
chronic	
methadone	
mainte-	
nance	
found	
the	
average	
Epworth

Scale

to	
be	
within

range	
.	

In	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
who	
manifested	
only	
mild	
to	
moderate	
OSA	
(	
average	
AHI	
about	
18/

,	
the	
degree

This

is	
typically

after	
opioids	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
have	
been	
used	
for	
at	
least	
two

.	

An

has	
been	
reported	
with

.	

There	
has	
been	
a	
large	
increase	
in	
deaths	
associated	
with

due	
to	
the	
increasing

.	

Many	
of	
these

occur	
during

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
presumed	
pathophysiology	
for	
the	
development	
of	
these	
varied	
breathing	
abnor-	
malities	
during	
sleep	
is	
the	
respiratory	
depression	
that	
occurs	
through	
action	
of	
the	
drugs	
on	
the	
μ	
-	
receptors	
on	
the	
ventral	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
surface	
of	
the	
medulla	TISSUE
.	

Studies	
have	
demon-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
strated	
depression	
of	
the	
awake	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
drive	
;	
however	
,	
it	
often	
improves	
after	
five	
to	
eight	
months	
of	
continued	
drug	
use	
.	

In	
one	
study	
the	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
drive	
never	
fully	
normalized	
.	

Another	
study	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
on	
chronic	
meth-	
adone	
maintenance	
found	
that	
the	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
drive	
is	
increased	
compared	
to	
that	
of	
control	
subjects	
.	

In	
this	
study	
the	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
response	
was	
reduced	
in	
comparison	
with	
that	
of	
controls	
who	
were	
not	
taking	
opioids	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

The	
difference	
was	
not	
due	
to	
a	
lower	
tidal	
volume	
but	
rather	
reduced	
respiratory	
rate	
.	

Differences	
in	
technique	
or	
patient	ORGANISM
population	
may	
explain	
the	
divergent	
findings	
.	

The	
cause	
of	
the	
ataxic	
breathing	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
on	
opiates	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
is	
not	
known	
.	

However	
,	
one	
study	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
on	
chronic	
opioids	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
found	
that	
the	
incidence	
of	
ataxic	
breathing	
increased	
with	
the	
total	
narcotic	
dose	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
The	
drug	
-	
induced	
central	
apneas	
may	
occur	
as	
a	
form	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
with	
runs	
of	
central	
apneas	
separated	
by	
a	
short	
ventilatory	
phase	
(	
2	
to	
4	
breaths	
)	
or	
intermittent	
and	
sporadic	
central	
apneas	
.	

The	
underlying	
breathing	
pattern	
may	
show	
a	
slow	
respi-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
ratory	
rate	
or	
an	
ataxic	
breathing	
pattern	
.	

The	
term	
ataxic	
breathing	
is	
sometimes	
used	
as	
a	
synonym	
of	
Biot	
breathing	
,	
although	
definitions	
of	
the	
latter	
term	
vary	
widely	
.

Ataxic	
breathing	
is	
characterized	
by	
an	
irregular	
breathing	
rhythm	
as	
well	
as	
irregular	
depth	
of	
breathing	
(

)	
.	

Obstructive	
breathing	
events	
are	
also	
common	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
taking	
potent	
opioids	
and	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
both	
OSA

is	
often	
appro-	
priate	
.	

Prolonged	
obstructive	
apneas	
with	
severe	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE

may	
be	
noted	
.	

The	
drug	
-

central

occur	
mainly	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
and	
,	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
without	
coexistent	
obstructive	
apnea	
,	
the	
AHI	
may	
be	
much	
lower	
during	
REM	
than	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
also	
tend	
to	
have	
a	
low	
arousal	
index	
and	
increased

sleep	
.	

Unlike	
other	
forms	
of	
central	
apnea	
,	
drug	
-	
induced	
central	
apneas	
may	
occur	
during	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

This	
condition	
is	
best	
distinguished	
from	
other	
types	
of	
central	
sleep	
apnea	
by	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
ongoing	
use	
of	
long	
-	
acting	
opioids	
.	

Other	
SRBDs	
may	
be	
present	
and	
may	
complicate	
PSG	
findings	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further

Further	
study	
is	
needed	
to	
determine	
risk	
factors	
and	
pathogenesis	
for	
development	
of	
these	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
patterns	
in	
users	
of	
long

.	

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
these

patterns	
may	
play	
a	
role	
in	
the	
unex-

and	
Associated	
Events	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Primary	
CSA	
is	
of	
unknown	
etiology	
(	
idiopathic	
)	
and	
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent	
central	
apneas	
,	
defined	
as	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
during	
sleep	
associated	
with	
an	
absence	
of	
respiratory	
effort	
.	

Airflow	
and	
respiratory	
effort	
cease	
simultaneously	
in	
a	
repetitive	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
fashion	
over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
night	
.	

This	
recurrent	
cessation	
and	
resumption	
of	
venti-	
lation	
can	
lead	
to	
sleep	
fragmentation	
,	
yielding	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
frequent	
nocturnal	
awakenings	
,	
or	
both	
.	

Thus	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
present	
with	
symptoms	
of	
hyper-	
somnolence	
or	
insomnia	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
primary	
CSA	
tend	
to	
have	
low	
normal	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
PaCO2	
during	
wakefulness	
(	
less	
than	
40	
mm	
Hg	
)	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
known	
medical	
or	
neurological	
disorder	
that	
is	
believed	
to	
cause	
central	
apneas	
are	
classified	
elsewhere	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Patients	ORGANISM
generally	
present	
with	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
sleep	
fragmentation	
,	
or	
insomnia	
.	

Other	
signs	
and	
symptoms	
that	
are	
often	
,	
but	
not	
invariably	
,	
present	
include	
snoring	
,	
witnessed	
apnea	
,	
and	
awakening	
with	
shortness	
of	
breath	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	

The	
disorder	
is	
rare	
,	
precluding	
identification	
of	
any	
definite	
subtypes	
.	

Demographics	
Not	
known	
.	

Most	
studies	
suggest	
this	
disorder	
is	
rare	
,	
most	
common	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
to	
elderly	
individuals	
,	
and	
more	
frequent	
in	
men	ORGANISM
than	
women	ORGANISM
,	
although	
not	
all	
studies	
support	
this	
sex	
bias	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
CSA	
in	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
occurs	
because	
the	
arterial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
PCO2	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
(	
PaCO2	
)	
drops	
below	
the	
hypo-	
capnic	
apnea	
threshold	
(	
HAT	
)	
.	

During	
wakefulness	
,	
drops	
in	
PaCO2	
do	
not	
result	
in	
apnea	
.	

However	
,	
during	
sleep	
,	
when	
the	
PaCO2	
drops	
below	
the	
HAT	
,	
respiratory	
effort	
ceases	
.	

For	
most	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
the	
HAT	
is	
within	
a	
few	
mm	
Hg	
of	
the	
awake	
PaCO2	
.	

Any	
factors	
that	
narrow	
the	
gap	
between	
the	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
and	
the	
HAT	
predispose	
to	
central	
apnea	
.	

A	
high	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
seems	
to	
be	
a	
major	
predisposing	
factor	
in	
the	
development	
of	
primary	
CSA	
.	

This	
can	
lead	
to	
the	
instability	
in	
venti-	
latory	
control	
that	
characterizes	
the	
disorder	
.	

Frequent	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
can	
also	
predispose	
to	
the	
development	
of	
central	
apneas	
,	
as	
ventilatory	
control	
is	
somewhat	
unstable	
at	
sleep	
-	
wake	
transitions	
.	

Increased	
ventilation	
associated	
with	
arousal	
can	
result	
in	
a	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
HAT	
after	
the	
return	
to	
sleep	
.	

Because	
ventilatory	
drive	
is	
lower	
during	
REM	
than	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
hypocapnic	
central	
apnea	
is	
much	
less	
common	
during	
that	
sleep	
stage	
.	

Two	
other	
variables	
have	
been	
discussed	
as	
possible	
predispos-	
ing	
factors	
,	
although	
their	
true	
role	
in	
the	
development	
of	
this	
syndrome	
is	
uncertain	
.	

First	
,	
frequent	
arousal	
or	
awakening	
due	
to	
low	
arousal	
threshold	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
insomnia	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
lead	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
central	
apneas	
.	

Because	
ventila-	
tory	
control	
can	
be	
somewhat	
unstable	
in	
the	
normal	
wake	
-	
sleep	
transition	
with	
occa-	
sional	
central	
apneas	
being	
observed	
in	
otherwise	
normal	
individuals	
,	
any	
disorder	
that	
interrupts	
sleep	
may	
worsen	
CSA	
.	

Some	
studies	
have	
suggested	
a	
worsening	
of	
primary	
CSA	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
,	
but	
this	
has	
been	
more	
clearly	
documented	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

Some	
data	
suggest	
that	
ventilatory	
chemoresponsiveness	
is	
directly	
inherited	
.	

Because	
elevated	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
responsiveness	
is	
a	
predisposing	
variable	
in	
the	
development	
of	
idio-	
pathic	
CSA	
,	
it	
would	
seem	
likely	
that	
there	
would	
be	
a	
familial	
pattern	
in	
the	
develop-	
ment	
of	
this	
respiratory	
abnormality	
.	

However	
,	
there	
are	
no	
data	
addressing	
this	
issue

There	
is	
little	
evidence	
that	
these	
apneas	
or	
their	
associated	
hypoxia	
and	
hypercapnia	
lead	
to	
pulmonary	ORGAN

or

Developmental	
Issues	
Criteria	
for	
apnea	
of	
infancy	
and	
apnea	
of	
prematurity	
are	
detailed	
elsewhere	
and	
it	
should	
be	
noted	
that	
central	
apnea	
is	
defined	
somewhat	
differently	
in	
infants	
and	
chil-	
dren	
than	
in	
adults	
.	

Central	
apneas	
that	
are	
brief	
(	
<	
20	
seconds	
in	
duration	
)	
and	
not	
associated	
with	
desaturation	
or	
arousal	
are	
commonly	
observed	
in	
both	
premature	
and	
term	
infants	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
population	
studies	
report	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
occurrence	
of	
central	
apnea	
with	
increasing	
age	
,	
especially	
in	
men	ORGANISM
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Primary	
CSA	
is	
caused	
by	
instability	
of	
the	
respiratory	
control	
system	
in	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
and	
less	
commonly	
during	
stable	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

Central	
apnea	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
primary	
CSA	
most	
often	
occurs	
during	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
and	
is	
rare	
during	
stages	

N3	
and	
R	
sleep	
.	

Central	
apneas	
tend	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
high	
or	
increased	
ventilatory	
responsiveness	
to	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

Arterial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
PCO2	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
levels	
below	
the	
hypocapnic	
apnea	
threshold	
lead	
to	
a	
cessation	
in	
ventilatory	
effort	
and	
,	
therefore	
,	
a	
central	
apnea	
.	

Individuals	
with	
high	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
ventilatory	
responsiveness	
tend	
to	
have	
lower	
PaCO2	
levels	
(	
both	
daytime	
and	
sleep	
)	
and	
a	
lower	
gradient	
between	
the	
sleep-	
ing	
PaCO2	
and	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

Hence	
,	
a	
smaller	
increase	
in	
ventilation	
is	
required	
to	
reach	
this	
apnea	
threshold	
and	
inhibit	
ventilation	
.	

Individuals	
with	
high	
chemore-	
sponsiveness	
also	
hyperventilate	
more	
in	
response	
to	
small	
changes	
in	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
PaCO2	
.	

This	
again	
often	
drives	
the	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
apnea	
threshold	
,	
yielding	
a	
cessation

However	
,	
not	
all	
factors	
that	
cause	
greater	
ventilatory	
drive	
have	
the	
same	
effect	
.	

Studies	
suggest	
that	
although	
hypoxemia	
increases	
chemoresponsiveness	
to	
PaCO2	
,	
the	
gap	
between	
the	
PaCO2	
and	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
is	
smaller	
(	
predispos-	
ing	
to	
central	
apnea	
)	
.	

Metabolic	
acidosis	
and	
nonhypoxic	
chemoreceptor	
stimulants	
tend	
to	
decrease	
HAT	
more	
than	
they	
decrease	
the	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
larger	
gap	
between	
the	
HAT	
and	
the	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
and	
lower	
likelihood	
of	
central	
apnea	
.	

Metabolic	
alkalosis	
tends	
to	
increase	
HAT	
as	
well	
as	
decrease	
ventilatory	
responsive-	
ness	
,	
yielding	
a	
smaller	
gap	
between	
the	
HAT	
and	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
The	
PSG	
of	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
with	
primary	
CSA	
demonstrates	
more	
than	
five	
central	
apneas	
and/or	
central	
hypopneas	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
.	

The	
central	
apneas	
and	
central	
hypopneas	
meet	
criteria	
for	
these	
respiratory	
events	
in	
adults	
or	
children	ORGANISM
as	
defined	
by	
the	
most	
recent	
version	
of	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated	
Events	
.	

Published	
studies	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
primary	
CSA	
have	
required	
that	
>	
50	
%	
to	
85	
%	
of	
respiratory	
events	
be	
central	
apneas	
.	

Periodic	
breathing	
characterized	
by	
episodes	
of	
recurrent	
central	
apneas	
separated	
by	
periods	
of	
ventilation	
may	
occur	
.	

The	
inter-	
event	
respiratory	
phase	
is	
typically	
brief	
with	
a	
maximum	
of	
five	
breaths	
.	

The	
venti-	
latory	
phase	
between	
central	
apneas	
does	
not	
have	
the	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
breathing	
.	

Central	
apneas	
commonly	
lead	
to	
mild	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
oxygen	
desaturation	
,	
although	
more	
severe	
desaturation	
can	
occur	
.	

Central	
apneas	
may	
also	
lead	
to	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
,	
causing	
fragmentation	
and	
yielding	
increased	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
at	
the	
expense	
of	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
central	
apneas	
in	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
less	
common	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

In	
summary	
,	
respiration	
,	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
oxygenation	
,	
and	
sleep	
architecture	
are	
affected	
by	
this	
disorder	
.	

Additionally	
,	
an	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
PaCO2	

less	
than	
40	
mm	

Hg	
is	
typically	
observed	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

These	
patients	ORGANISM
do	
not	
exhibit	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Normal	
individuals	
may	
have	
a	
few	
central	
apneas	
in	
the	
wake	
-	
sleep	
transition	
.	

However	
,	
once	
stable	
sleep	
is	
achieved	
,	
these	
apneas	
should	
cease	
.	

Normal	
individuals	
should	
not	
have	
more	
than	
five	
central	
apneas	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
.	

Primary	
CSA	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
sleep	
related	
breathing	
disorders	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
predominantly	
OSA	
will	
have	
central	
apneas	
during	
diagnostic	
or	
positive	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
pressure	
titration	
studies	
.	

These	
apneas	
tend	
to	
resolve	
immediately	
or	
over	
time	
on	
positive	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
pressure	
treatment	
.	

The	
pattern	
of	
central	
apneas	
in	
primary	
CSA	
differs	
from	
that	
of	
CSA	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

Primary	
CSA	
lacks	
the	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
respiration	
between	
contiguous	
central	
apneas	
noted	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
CSA	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
is	
longer	
in	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
(	
greater	
than	
40	
seconds	
and	
typically	
45	
to	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

The	
longer	
cycle	
length	
in	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
versus	
primary	
CSA	
is	
due	
to	
a	
longer	
respiratory	
phase	
between	
central	
apneas	
.	

In	
primary	
CSA	
,	
the	
apnea	
is	
often	
terminated	
abruptly	
by	
a	
large	
breath	
,	
and	
there	
are	
usually	
no	
more	
that	
4	
to	
5	
breaths	
between	
apneas	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
most	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
respiration	
will	
have	
a	
history	
of	
congestive	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
or	
a	
neurological	
disorder	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
central	
apnea	
due	
to	
substance	
use	
,	
particularly	
potent	
long	
-	
acting	
narcotics	
,	
may	
exhibit	
periodic	
breathing	
with	
central	
apneas	
,	
but	
the	
pattern	
of	
ventilation	
between	
apneas	
does	
not	
have	
a	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
and	
the	
cycle	
length	
is	
shorter	
than	
40	
seconds	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
underlying	
pattern	
of	
breathing	
is	
often	
ataxic	
(	
irregular	
varia-	
tions	
in	
cycle	
length	
and	
tidal	TISSUE
volume	
)	
and	
a	
low	
respiratory	
rate	
may	
be	
noted	
.	

Unlike	
primary	
CSA	
,	
central	
apneas	
can	
occur	
during	
stage	
N3	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
taking	
opioids	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
CSA	
due	
to	
medical	
or	
neurological	
conditions	
not	
of	
the	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
pattern	
often	
have	
a	
history	
of	
a	
known	
neurological	
disorder	
(	
recent	
cerebrovascular	
accident	
)	
but	
in	
others	
a	
high	
index	
of	
suspicion	
for	
an	
underlying	
disorder	
is	
indi-	
cated	
.	

For	
example	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
Chiari	
malformation	
may	
present	
in	
adulthood	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
with	
unexplained	
central	
apneas	
and	
relatively	
few	
other	
symptoms	
.	

Thus	
,	
primary	
CSA	
is	
a	
diagnosis	
based	
on	
careful	
exclusion	
of	
other	
causes	
of	
CSA	
.	

In	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
and	
hypoxemic	
syndromes	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
normal	
or	
increased	
daytime	
arterial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
PCO2	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
(	
PaCO2	
)	
with	
the	
onset	
or	
worsening	
of	
hypoven-	
tilation	
during	
sleep	
.	

Daytime	
hypoventilation	
is	
defined	
as	
a	
PaCO2	
>	
45	
mm	

Hg	
.	

Patient	ORGANISM
with	
primary	
CSA	
usually	
have	
an	
awake	
PaCO2	
<	

40	
mm	
Hg	
.	

The	
causes	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
include	
abnormalities	
in	
ventilatory	
control	
,	
neuro-	
muscular	ORGAN
disease	
,	
parenchymal	CANCER
lung	CANCER
disease	CANCER
,	
or	
restrictive	
chest

disorders	
.	

PSG	
in	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
reveal	
a	
few	
central	
apneas	
,	
but	
the	
predominant	
pattern	
is	
one	
of	
reduced	
tidal	TISSUE
volume	
(	
shallow	
pattern	
of	
breathing	
)	
,	
often	
without	
a	
compensatory	
increase	
in	
respiratory	
rate	
.	

There	
is	
usually	
significant	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
secondary	
to	
hypoventilation	
and/or	
ventilation

.

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Although	
primary	
CSA	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
relatively	
rare	
disorder	
,	
additional

are	
needed

The	
pathophysiology

this

remains	
unclear

Specifically

the

(	
low

These

It	
is	
a

Apnea	
in	
the

to	
be	
the	
cause	
rather	
than	
an

Despite	
the

either	
as

thus	
an

with

in	
most

Apnea	
of	
prematurity	
occurs	
equally	
in	
males	
and	
females	
,	
and	
in	
infants	
of	
all	
races	
and	
ethnic	
groups	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Developmental	
delay	
in	
respiratory	
control	
associated	
with	
premature	
birth	
is	
the	
major	
predisposing	
condition	
.	

Diverse	
factors	
are	
known	
to	
precipitate	
development	
of	
apneic	
episodes	
in	
predisposed	
preterm	
infants	
.	

These	
include	
thermal	
instability	
,	
gastroesophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
reflux	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
intracranial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
pathology	
,	
substances	
,	
anesthesia	
,	
metabolic	
disorders	
,	
impaired	
oxygenation	
,	
and	
infection	
.	

Infection	
with	
respiratory	
syncytial	
virus	
can	
increase	
the	
frequency	
and	
the	
duration	
of	
apneas	
in	
predisposed	
infants	
.	

OSA	
associated	
with	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
abnormalities	
can	
present	
as	
apnea	
of	
prematurity	
.	

Persistence	
of	
apnea	
after	
43	
weeks	
conceptional	
age	
should	
raise	
suspicion	
of	
addi-	
tional	
etiologic	
factors	
.

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
In	
preterm	
infants	
,	
apnea	
is	
rare	
on	
day	
one	
of	
life	
,	
and	
its	
presence	
usually	
signals	
another	
illness	
.	

More	
typical	
onset	
occurs	
between	
the	
second	
and	
seventh	
days	
.	

Apnea	
of	
prematurity	
usually	
ceases	
by	
37	
weeks	
conceptional	
age	
but	
may	
persist	
for	
several	
weeks	
beyond	
term	
,	
especially	
in	
infants	
born	
before	
28	
weeks	
postconception	
;	
apnea	
beyond	
43	
weeks	
postconception	
is	
rare	
.	

Adverse	
outcomes	
for	
former	
preterm	
infants	
are	
more	
closely	
related	
to	
the	
prenatal	
or	
neonatal	
course	
,	
associated	
comorbidities	
,	
and	
environmental	
factors	
than	
to	
the	
apnea	
of	
prematurity	
per	
se	
.	

For	
most	
children	ORGANISM
,	
long	
-	
term	
outcomes	
for	
uncomplicated	
apnea	
of	
prematurity	
are	
excellent	
.	

However	
,	
the	
prognosis	
for	
infants	
with	
persistent	
recurrent	
apnea	
spells	
requiring	
frequent	
resuscitation	
is	
more	
guarded	
and	
depends	
on	
the	
cause	
of	
the	
apnea	
and	
associated	
comorbidities	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	

This	
is	
a	
condition	
related	
to	
prematurity	
that	
normally	
improves	
over	
time	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Physiological	
factors	
contributing	
to	
apnea	
are	
related	
to	
immaturity	
of	
respiratory	
control	
.	

These	
include	
developmental	
alterations	
in	
central

,	
chemoreceptor	
or	
mechanoreceptor	
responses	
,	
and	
upper	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY

Precipitating	
factors	
for

include

Objective	
Findings	
Most	
premature	
neonates	ORGANISM
are	
diagnosed	
with	
apnea	
of	
prematurity	
based	
on	
cardio-	
respiratory	
monitoring	
in	
the	
neonatal	
intensive	
care	
unit	
,	
rather	
than	
by	
PSG	
.	

When	
PSG	
is	
performed	
,	
central	
apneas	
are	
often	
shown	
to	
have	
a	
mixed	
component	
,	
with	
mixed	
apneas	
accounting	
for	
50	
%	
to	
75	
%	
of	
apneas	
in	
small	
premature	
infants	
;	
studies	
suggest	
that	
obstructive	
-	
type	
events	
account	
for	
10	
%	
to	
20	
%	
of	
events	
;	
and	
pure	
central	
events	
,	
10	
%	
to	
25	
%	
.	

Periodic	
breathing	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Apnea	
of	
prematurity	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
normal	
,	
physiologic	
respiratory	
pauses	
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
in	
infants	
.	

Studies	
have	
shown	
that	
healthy	
asymptom-	
atic	
infants	
commonly	
have	
brief	
(	
<	
20	
second	
)	
central	
respiratory	
pauses	
,	
either	
as	
isolated	
events	
(	
particularly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
)	
or	
after	
sigh	
breaths	
or	
movements	
(	
in	
which	
case	
the	
apneas	
may	
be	
longer	
)	
.	

These	
infants	
are	
typically	
asymptomatic	
,	
with	
no	
changes	
in	
color	
or	
muscle	ORGAN
tone	
.	

The	
differential	
diagnosis	
is	
long	
and	
includes	
apnea	
secondary	
to	
severe	
gastroesoph-	
ageal	
reflux	
,	
central	
nervous	
system	
malformations	
or	
hemorrhage	
,	
seizures	
,	
sepsis	
,	
and	
rarely	
primary	
cardiac	ORGAN
arrhythmias	
.	

Comorbid	
conditions	
should	
be	
suspected	
whenever	
apneas	
are	
severe	
or	
continue	
beyond	
43	
weeks	
gestation	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

The	
mechanisms	
underlying	
physiologic	
maturation	
of	
ventilatory	
control	
are	
not	
well	
understood	
.	

Further	
research	
is	
required	
to	
determine	
which	
infants	
are	
at	
greatest	
risk	
for	
severe	
apnea

A	
diagnosis	
of	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
central	
sleep	
apnea	
does	
not	
exclude	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	
.	

That	
is	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	
can	
be	
made	
based	
on	
the	
diagnostic	
sleep	
study	
.	

Essential	
Features	
A	
diagnosis	
of	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	
is	
characterized	
by	
predominantly	
obstructive	
events	
(	
obstructive	
or	
mixed	
apnea	
or	
hypopnea	
)	
during	
a	
diagnostic	
sleep	
study	
with	
persistence	
or	
emergence	
of	
CSA	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
during	
administration	
of	
positive	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
pressure	
without	
a	
backup	
rate	
,	
despite	
significant	
resolution	
of	
obstructive	
respiratory	
events	
.	

If	
the	
central	
apnea	
is	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
CSA	
disorder	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
given	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	
and	
that	
CSA	
disorder	
rather	
than	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	
(	
e.g.	
,	
a	
patient	ORGANISM
with	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
exhibits	
mainly	
obstructive	
events	
during	
diagnostic	
PSG	
but	
then	
exhibits	
predominantly	
central	
apnea	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
on	
positive	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
pressure	
)	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Patients	ORGANISM
with	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	
have	
several	
characteristics	
when	
placed	
on	
positive	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
pressure	
without	
a	
backup	
rate	
.	

A	
high	
number	
of	
arousals	
persist	
on	
PAP	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
treatment	
,	
and	
the	
AHI	
is	
often	
higher	
during	
NREM	
than	
REM	
sleep	
.	

This	
is	
due	
to	
the	
fact	
that	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
central	
apneas	
almost	
invariably	
occur	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

Pressures	TISSUE
that	
are	
effective	
in	
controlling	
obstructive	
events	
during	
REM	
sleep	
prove	
ineffective	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
due	
to	
emergence	
of	
central	
apneas	
.	

If	
patients	ORGANISM
can	
attain	
stage	
N3	
,	
central	
apneas	
often	
decrease	
until	
interrupted	
by	
an	
arousal	
or	
transition	
to	
a	
lighter	
stage	
of	
sleep	
that	
precipitates	
another	
run	
of	
central	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	
can	
have	
persistent	
sleep	
fragmentation	
on	
CPAP	
treatment	
and	
may	
report	
little	
benefit	
from

Demographics	
The

on	
the	
initial	
poly-	
somnographic	
positive

pressure	
titration	
varies	
from	
2	
%	
to	
20	
%	
depending	
on	
the	
characteristics	
of	
the	
group	
studied	
(	
community	
or	
referral	
sleep	
center	
)	
and	
the	
methodology	
.	

If	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
are	
taking	
opioids	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
or	
have	
underling	
central	
apnea	
with	
CSB	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
are	
included	
,	
the	
percentage	
is	
at	
the	
higher	
end	
of	
the	
range	
.	

The	
percentage	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
central	
sleep	
apnea	
that	
persists	
on	
chronic	
CPAP	
treatment	
(	
approxi-	
mately	
2	
%	
)	
is	
considerably	
lower	
than	
the	
percentage	
identified	
on	
the

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	

A	
number	
of	
factors	
have	
been	
hypothesized	
to	
cause	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	
,	
but	
definitive	
data	
are	
not	
available	
.	

The	
patients	ORGANISM
presumably	
have	
characteristics	
that	
would	
predispose	
them	
to	
instability	
in	
ventilatory	
control	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
.

Disorders	
These	
include	
a	
low	
arousal	
threshold	
and	
high

.	

Studies	
have	
found	
that	
often	
a	
small	
increase	
in	
end	
-	
tidal	
PCO2	
can	
stabilize	
breathing	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with

.	

Therefore	
,	
any	
events	
that	
predis-	
pose	
a	
patient	ORGANISM
to	
hypocapnia	
can	
trigger	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
central

.	

In	
some	
,	
but	
not	
all	
studies	
,	
the	
overall	
AHI	
on	
the	
diagnostic	
PSG	
(	
or

portion	
of

was	
higher	
in	
the	
treatment

group	
compared	
to	
the	
patients	ORGANISM
without	
this	
diagnosis	
.	

In	
other

,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	
had	
more	
central	
apneas	
during	
the	
diagnostic	
PSG	
and	
were	
more	
likely	
to	
be	
male	
.	

However	
,	
identified

for	
treatment

vary	
considerably	
from

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Many	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
have	
a	
few	
central	
events	
while	
on	
PAP	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

However	
,	
in	
the	
majority	
of	
cases	
,	
the	
central	
AHI	
is	
not	
≥	
5	
/	
hour	
and	
central	
events	
are	
not	
≥	
50	
%	
of	
the	
total	
number	
of	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
.	

Other	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
,	
while	
on	
PAP	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
exhibit	
predominantly	
central	
events	
that	
are	
believed	
to	
be	
secondary	
to	
a	
CSA	
disor-	
der	
classified	
elsewhere	
.	

In	
this	
case	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
both	
OSA	
and	
the	
CSA	
disorder	
is	
appropriate	
,	
rather	
than	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	
.	

For	
example	
,	
a	
patient	ORGANISM
taking	
methadone	
has	
predominantly	
obstructive	
events	
during	
the	
diagnostic	
portion	
of	
a	
split	
-	
night	
PSG	
.	

Once	
obstructive	
events	
are	
eliminated	
on	
PAP	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
CSA	
with	
ataxic	
breathing	
is	
noted	
.	

A	
diagnosis	
of	
both	
OSA	
and	
CSA	
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
should	
be	
made	
if	
criteria	
for	
that	
disorder	
are

Further

to	
increase	
the

the

,	
arousals

and

and	
,	
in	
such	
cases	
,	
a	
diagnosis

Essential	
Features	
OHS	
is	
characterized	
by	
obesity	
and	
daytime	
hypercapnia	
(	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
PaCO2	
>

)	
that	
can	
not	
be	
fully	
attributed	
to	
an	
underlying	
cardiopulmonary	
or	
neurologic	
disease	
.	

Hypercapnia	
worsens	
during	
sleep	
and	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
severe	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
oxygen	
desaturation	
.	

Hypoventilation	
is	
often	
worse	
during	
REM	
than	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

The	
majority	
of	
OHS	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
comorbid	
OSA	
(	
80	
%	
to	
90	
%	
)	
.	

In	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
daytime	
hypercapnia	
may	
improve	
or	
even	
normalize	
with	
adequate	
PAP	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
treatment	
and	
sustained	
adherence	
to	
treatment	
.	

Those	
OHS	
patients	ORGANISM
without	
OSA	
exhibit	
sustained	
or	
intermittent	
episodes	
of	
shallow	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
associated	
with	
worsening	
hypoventilation	
and	
hypoxemia	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
OHS	
may	
have	
few	
,	
if	
any	
,	
sleep	
com-	TISSUE
plaints	
,	
or	
may	
present	
with	
considerable	
sleep	
disturbance	
including	
reduced	
sleep	
efficiency	
and	
frequent	
awakenings	
.	

Hypercapnia	
and	
hypoxemia	
may	
remain	
unno-	
ticed	
for	
quite	
some	
time	
until	
sudden	
deterioration	
with	
cardiopulmonary	TISSUE
arrest	
or	
severe	
decompensation	
(	
acute	
or	
chronic	
hypercapnic	
respiratory

)	
develops	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Patients	ORGANISM
with	
OHS	
commonly	
complain	
of	
hypersomnolence	
.	

The	
severity	
of	
hyper-	
somnolence	
may	
not	
correlate	
closely	
with	
degree	
of

Obesity

even	
in

However	
,	
in	
one

of	
inpatients	ORGANISM

,	
those	
with

had	
an

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
etiology	
of	
hypoventilation	
is	
not	
completely	
understood	
.	

Although	
comorbid	
OSA	
is	
common	
,	
hypercapnia	
and	
hypoxemia	
are	
not	
entirely	
a	
function	
of	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
obstruction	
.	

The	
importance	
of	
various	
factors	
leading	
to	
hypoventilation	
likely	
varies	
among	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

It	
has	
been	
postulated	
that	
sustained	
nocturnal	
hypercapnia	
results	
from	
the	
development	
of	
short	
(	
due	
to	
apnea	
-	
hypopnea	
)	
or	
longer	
(	
secondary	
to	
hypoven-	
tilation	
)	
periods	
of	
hypercapnia	
accompanied	
by	
inadequate	
compensation	
(	
i.e.	
,	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
unloading	
)	
during	
periods	
of	
ventilation	
between	
obstructive	
events	
.	

Abnormal	
venti-	
latory	
control	
(	
blunted	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
response	
)	
allows	
hypercapnia	
to	
persist	
into	
wakefulness	
after	
the	
cause	
of	
acute	
hypercapnia	
is	
no	
longer	
present	
.	

A	
chronic	
hypercapnic	
state	
would	
produce	
an	
elevation	
of	
bicarbonate	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

Although	
this	
blunts	
the	
degree	
of	
acidosis	
due	
to	
an	
elevated	
PaCO2	
,	
it	
reduces	
the	
compensatory	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
ventilatory	
response	
.	

Impaired	
renal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
bicarbonate	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
excretion	
rate	
,	
as	
seen	
in	
hypoxia	
,	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
,	
or	
diuretic	
-	
related	
chloride	
deficiency	
,	
may	
contribute	
to	
the	
persistence	
of	
hypercapnia	
.	

Obesity	
itself	
is	
also	
associated	
with	
several	
factors	
that	
predispose	
to	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
retention	
.	

Obesity	
itself	
increases	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
production	
.	

There	
is	
an	
increased	
work	
of	
breathing	
due	
to	
mass	
loading	
from	
the	
additional	
weight	
on	
the	
respiratory	
pump	
as	
well	
as	
resistive	
loading	
due	
to	
intermittent	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
obstruction	
during	
sleep	
.	

Numerous	
factors	
impair	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
elimination	
including	
altered	
lung	ORGAN
volumes	
and	
mechan-	
ics	
,	
ventilation	
-	
perfusion	
abnormalities	
secondary	
to	
atelectasis	
or	
pulmonary	ORGAN
conges-	
tion	
,	
reduced	
chemosensitivity	
and	
load	
responsiveness	
,	
and	
suppression	
of	
respiratory	
drive	
due	
to	
obesity	
-	
related	
humoral	
factors	
,	
such	
as	
resistance	
to	
the	
elevated	
leptin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
that	
occur	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
the	
OHS	
(	
leptin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
a	
respiratory	
stimulant	
)	
.	

The	
impor-	
tance	
of	
these	
factors	
likely	
varies	
from	
patient	ORGANISM
to	
patient	ORGANISM

OSA	
is

in	
the	
majority	
of	
OHS	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
during	
at	
least	
a	
portion	
of	
the

.	

The	
transient

tilation	
between	
obstructive	
events	
(	
even	
if	
associated	
with	
arousal	
from	
the	
preceding	
obstructive	
event	
)	
is	
not	
sufficient	
to	
prevent	
worsening	
hypoventilation	
during	
sleep	
.	

Severe	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
oxygen	
desaturation	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
the	
obstructive

.	

Chronic

can	
be	
associated	
with	
polycythemia	
.	

Electrocardiography	
,	
chest	
radi-	
ography	
,	
and	
echocardiography	
may	
demonstrate	
evidence	
of	
pulmonary	ORGAN
hypertension	
.	

The	
serum	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
bicarbonate	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
level	
is	
usually	
elevated	
due	
to	
renal	CANCER
compensation	
for	
chronic	
respiratory	
acidosis	
(	
hypercapnia	
)	
.	

In	
one	
study	
,	
a	
serum	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
bicarbonate	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
level	
threshold	
>	
27	
mEq	
/

had

of	
50	
%	
of	
identifying	
OHS	
in	
obese	
patients	ORGANISM
suspected	
of	
having	
OSA	
.	

This	
suggests	
that	
the	
serum	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
bicarbonate	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
level	
may	
be	
useful	
to	
screen	
patients	ORGANISM
for	
possible	
OHS	
.	

However	
,	
an	
arterial	AMINO_ACID
blood	AMINO_ACID
gas	AMINO_ACID
is	
required	
for	
diagnosis	
of	
OHS	
,	
as	
the	
serum	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE

may	
be	
elevated	
due

includes	
any

.	

OSA	
and	
CSA	
syndromes	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
by	
the	
periodic	
alterations	
in	
airflow	
and	
accompanying	
periodic	
fluctuations	
in	
SaO2	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
due	
to	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
is	
generally	
more	
sustained	
,	
usually	
several	
minutes	
or	
longer	
in	
duration	
.	

When	
more	
than	
one	
disorder	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
responsible	
for	
the	
ventilatory	
insufficiency	
during	
sleep	
,	
all	
pertinent	
diagnoses	
should	
be	
coded

some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
PHOX2B	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
genotype	
may	
present	
phenotypically	
later	
in	
life	
(	
and	
even	
in	
adulthood	
)	
,	
especially	
in	
the	
presence	
of	
a

such	
as	
general

or	
a	
severe	
respiratory

Essential	
Features	
Congenital	
central	
alveolar	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
hypoventilation	
syndrome	
(	
CCHS	
)	
is	
a	
syndrome	
of	
auto-	
nomic	
dysfunction	
,	
primarily	
the	
failure	
of	
automatic	
central	
control	
of	
breathing	
,	
due	
to	
a	
mutation	
of	
the	
PHOX2B	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
gene	
.	

CCHS	
is	
characterized	
by	
the	
onset	
of	
hypoven-	
tilation	
,	
usually	
at	
birth	
.	

The	
hypoventilation	
is	
worse	
during	
sleep	
than	
wakefulness	
and	
is	
unexplained	
by	
primary	
pulmonary	ORGAN
,	
neurological	
,	
or	
metabolic	
disease	
.	

CCHS	
typically	
presents	
in	
an	
otherwise	
normal	
-	
appearing	
infant	ORGANISM
who	
is	
noted	
to	
have	
cyano-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
sis	
,	
feeding	
difficulties	
,	
hypotonia	
or	
,	
less	
commonly	
,	
central	
apnea	
.	

Some	
children	ORGANISM
are	
diagnosed	
following	
cardiovascular	TISSUE
collapse	
.	

The	
infant	
requires	
intubation	
and	
then	
can	
not	
be	
weaned	
from	
mechanically	
assisted	
ventilation	
,	
despite	
appearing	
vigorous	
and	
having	
a	
normal	
chest	
radiograph	
.	

Some	
infants	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
may	
appear	
to	
breathe	
adequately	
on	
clinical	
examination	
but	
experience	
episodes	
of	
hypoventilation	
(	
not	
necessarily	
apnea	
)	
characterized	
by	
hypoxemia	
and	
hypercapnia	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
CCHS	
may	
occa-	
sionally	
present	
later	
in	
life	
with	
cyanosis	
,	
an	
apparent	
life	
-	
threatening	
event	
,	
cor	
pul-	
monale	
,	
or	
hypoxic	
neurological	
damage	
.	

CCHS	
has	
been	
diagnosed	
in	
adults	
who	
present	
with	
respiratory	
failure	
following	
anesthesia	
or	
in	
association	
with	
a	
minor	
respiratory	
illness	
;	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
usually	
have	
a	
mild	
mutation	
,	
and	
may	
have	
evidence	
of	
longstanding	
hypoxemia	
including	
cognitive	
deficits	
.	

Most	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
CCHS	
have	
sufficiently	
severe	
hypoventilation	
during	
sleep	
that	
they	
require	
mechanically	
assisted	
ventilation	
,	
although	
this	
state	
-	
dependent	
difference	
may	
not	
be	
apparent	
during	
early	
infancy	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
(	
~15	
%	
)	
hypoventilate	
during	
wakefulness	
as	
well	
as	
during	
sleep	
and	
require	
continuous	
ventilatory	
support	
.	

However	
,	
most	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
CCHS	
do	
not	
require	
ventilatory	
support	
during	
wakefulness	
but	
may	
have	
subtle	
abnormali-	
ties	
in	
gas	
exchange	
when	
physically	
inactive	
or	
during	
vigorous	
exercise	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Associated	
autonomic	
abnormalities	
include	
Hirschsprung	CANCER
disease	CANCER
in	
approximately	
16	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
CCHS	
,	
autonomic	
dysfunction	
(	
e.g.	
,	
decreased	
heart	ORGAN

)	
,	
neural	CANCER
tumors	CANCER
(	
e.g.

ganglioneuromas	CANCER
or	
ganglioneuroblastomas	CANCER
)	
,	
swallowing

during	
the	
early	
years	
,	
and	
ocular	
abnormalities	
(	
e.g.	
,	
stra-	
bismus	
)	
.	

Most	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
cognitively	
normal	
,	
although	
developmental	
delay	
may	
be	
present	
,	
especially	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
in	
whom	
the	
hypoventilation	
has	
not	
been	
well	
controlled	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Research	
suggests	
that	
severity	
of	
illness	
is	
related	
to	
the	
type	
of	
mutation	
present	
.	

Most	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
a	
polyalanine	
expansion	
mutation	
;	
those	
with	
more	
polyalanine	
repeats	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
have	
severe	
disease	
including	
waking	
hypoventilation	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
point	
mutation	
or	
frame	
shift	
mutations	
are	
at	
greater	
risk	
for	
neural	CANCER
tumors	CANCER
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
of	
CCHS	
is	
not	
known	
,	
but	
the	
disease	
is	
rare	
.	

The	
condition	
occurs	
equally	
among	
both	
sexes	
and	
all	
ethnic	
/	
racial	
groups	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
This	
is	
a	
congenital	
genetic	
syndrome	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
CCHS	
usually	
occurs	
as	
a	
de	
novo	
mutation	
,	
but	
siblings	
with	
the	
condition	
have	
been	
reported	
.	

As	
the	
gene	
is	
dominant	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
at	
risk	
of	
having	
children	ORGANISM
with	
CCHS	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	

The	
condition	
is	
genetic	
and	
is	
therefore	
present	
from	
birth	
,	
but	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
present	
later	
in	
life	
.	

The	
physiological	
abnormalities	
of	
CCHS	
persist	
for	
life	
and	
are	
not	
ameliorated	
over	
time	
.	

However	
,	
the	
clinical	
consequences	
of	
hypoventilation	
can	
be	
prevented	
by	
providing	
adequate	
ventilatory	
support	
.	

If	
untreated	
,	
death	
usually	
results	
from	
cor	
pulmonale	
or	
complications	
of	
apnea	
or	
severe	
hypoventilation	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
poorly	
controlled	
CCHS	
may	
develop	
mental	
retardation	
,	
growth	
failure	
,	
seizures	
,	
or	
cor	
pulmonale	
.	

When	
treated	
,	
infants	
with	
CCHS	
may	
improve	
over	
the	
first	
six	
to	
12	
months	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
initially	
require	
ventilatory	
support	
24	
hours	
a	
day	
may	
progress	
to	
adequate	
ventilation	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

However	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
continue	
to	
require	
ventilatory	
support	
during	
sleep	
.	

Conversely	
,	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
develop	
the	
need	
for	
continuous	
ventilatory	
support	
.	

It	
is	
unclear	
whether	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
had	
condi-	
tions	
that	
worsened	
,	
were	
not	
adequately	
evaluated	
and	
treated	
initially	
,	
or	
were	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
changing	
ventilatory	
demands	
.	

Even	
with	
treatment	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
CCHS	
require	
close	
monitoring	
,	
particularly	
during	
infancy	
.	

Minor	
medical	
illnesses	
,	
such	
as	
upper	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
respiratory	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
tract	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
illnesses	
or	
diarrhea	
,	
may	
precipitate	
bouts	
of	
respiratory	
failure	
.	

Edema	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
and	
lethargy	
are	
often	
early	
signs	
of	
impending	
respiratory	
failure	
.	

The	
clinical	
signs	
of	
hypoxemia	
and	
hypoventilation	
in	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
be	
subtle	
,	
as	
the

Disorders

and	
nasal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION

.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
gas

abnormalities	
may	
progress	
for	
some	
time	
without	
notice	
until	
the

Differential	
Diagnosis	
CCHS	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
forms	
of	
central	
hypoventilation	
,	
such	
as	
central	
hypoventilation	
due	
to

,	
other	
causes	
of

,	
metabolic	
conditions	
such	
as

,	
or

CCHS	
must	
also	
be	
distinguished	
from

be	
thought	
to	
have	
CCHS	
.	

However	
,	
these	
infants	
typically	
have	
intermittent	
episodes	
of	
apnea	
rather	
than	
sustained	
hypoventilation	
,	
and	
the	
episodes	
typically	
resolve	
once	
the	
primary	
cause	
has	
been	
treated

a	
disorder	
of	
central	
control	
of	
ventilation	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
are	
usually	
healthy	
until	
early	
childhood	
(	
often	
2	
-	
3	
years	
of	
age	
)	
when	
they	
develop	
hyperphagia	
and	
severe	
obesity	
,	
followed	
by	
central	
hypoventilation	
,	
which	
often	
presents	
as	
respiratory	
failure	
.	

The	
respiratory	
failure	
may	
be	
precipitated	
by	
a	
mild	
respiratory	
illness	
or	
anesthesia	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
require	
ventilatory	
support	
during	
sleep	
;	
most	
patients	ORGANISM
breathe	
adequately	
during	
wakefulness	
but	
some	
need	
ventilatory	
support	
during	
both	
wakefulness	
and	
sleep	
.	

The	
hypoventila-	
tion	
persists	
even	
if	
the	
patients	ORGANISM
lose	
weight	
,	
differentiating	
the	
condition	
from

Patients	ORGANISM
often	
develop	
hypothalamic	CANCER

characterized	
by	
increased

,	
which	
may	
include	
one	
or	
more	
of	
the	
following	
:	
diabetes

Complications	
Patients	ORGANISM
are	
typically

Obesity	
often	
begins	
in	
early	
childhood	
,	
perhaps	
because	
the	
child	
is	
old	
enough	
to	
walk	
around	
and	
obtain	
his

Respiratory	
failure	
typically	
presents	
several	
years

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
disorder	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
late	
presentation	
of	
congenital	
central	
hypoven-	
tilation	
syndrome	
by	
testing	
for	
the	
PHOX2B	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
gene	
.	

Genetic	
testing	
may	
also	
be	
useful	
in	
distinguishing	
the	
disorder	
from	
Prader	
-	
Willi	
syndrome	
,	
which	
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
known	
genetic	
abnormality	
.	

Most	
children	ORGANISM
with	
Prader	
-	
Willi	
syndrome	
have	
hypotonia	
at	
birth	
and	
more	
severe	
developmental	
delay	
.	

The	
disorder	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
obesity	
hypoventilation	
syndrome	
by	
the	
presence	
of	
endocrine	
abnormalities	
and	
other	
associated	
hypothalamic	
abnormalities	
,	
and	
by	
the	
persistence	
of	
hypoventilation	
despite	
weight	
loss	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
patients	ORGANISM
typically	
have	
a	
totally	
flat	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
response	
rather	
than	
the	
blunted	
response	
seen	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
obesity	
hypoventilation	
syndrome	
.	

The	
disorder	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
isolated	
hypopituitarism	
or	
other	
hypothalamic	
disease	
without	
hypoventilation	
,	
and	
from	
obesity

Notes	
.	

The	
predominant	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
one	
of	
reduced	
tidal	TISSUE
volume	
or	
ataxic	
breathing	
with	
associated	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
oxygen	
desaturation	
.	

Although	
OSA	
may	
be	
present	
,	
it	
is	
not	
believed	
to	
be	
the	
major	
cause	
of	
hypoventilation	
.	

When	
criteria	
are	
met	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
both	
OSA	
and	
idiopathic	
central	
alveolar	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
hypoventilation	
may	
be	
made	
.

the	
diagnosis

Essential	
Features	
Idiopathic	
central	
alveolar	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
hypoventilation	
is	
defined	
as	
the	
presence	
of	
decreased	
alve-	
olar	
ventilation	
resulting	
in	
sleep	
related	
hypercapnia	
and	
hypoxemia	
in	
individuals	
with	
presumed	
normal	
mechanical	
properties	
of	
the	
lung	ORGAN
and	
respiratory	
pump	
.	

Thus	
,	
chronic	
hypoventilation	
during	
sleep	
exists	
without	
any	
readily	
identifiable	
impairments	
of	
res-	
piration	
,

or	
use	
of	
respiratory	
depressant	
medications	
or	
substances	
.	

Diurnal	
as	
well	
as	
nocturnal	
hypoventilation	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
primarily	
to	
blunted	
chemoresponsiveness

CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

However

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
etiology	
of	
hypoventilation	
in	
these

is	
not	
understood	
.	

Chronic	
hyper-	
capnia	
and	
hypoxemia	
in	
idiopathic	
central	
alveolar	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
hypoventilation	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
to	
defective	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
O2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
homeostasis	
,	
with	
impaired	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
unloading	
,	
reduced	
chemoresponsiveness	
to	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
O2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
and	
suppression	
of

Imaging	
of	
the	
central	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
nervous	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
system	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
does	
not	
document	
a	
structural	
defect	
.	

Hypoventilation	
worsens	
during	
sleep	
compared	
to	
waking	
levels	
due	
to	
a	
further	
reduction	
in	
che-	
mosensitivity	
and	
decreased

of	
the	
ventilatory	
muscles	ORGAN

Additionally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	
,	
if	
sufficiently	
severe	
,	
may	
place	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
near

on	
the

Thus

Essential	
Features	

This	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
primarily	
by	
chronic	
hypoventilation	
and	
hypercapnia	
due	
to	
prolonged	
use	
of	
medications	
or	
substances	
known	
to	
depress	
ventilatory	
drive	
and/or	
impair	
respiratory	
muscle	ORGAN
mechanics	
.	

These	
agents	
include	
long	
-	
acting	
nar-	
cotics	
,	
anesthetics	
,	
sedative	
compounds	
,	
and	
muscle	CELL
relaxants	CELL
.	

The	
risk	
of	
respiratory	
insufficiency	
is	
increased	
with	
the	
concomitant	
use	
of	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
or	
with	
polypharmacy	
.	

Respiratory	
depressants	
can	
precipitate	
respiratory	
failure	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
limited	
pul-	
monary	ORGAN
reserves	
or	
exacerbate	
hypoventilation	
in	
those	
with	
baseline	
hypercapnia	
.	

Hypoxemia	
is	
commonly	
present	
and	
can	
show	
either	
a	
sustained	
reduction	
or	
episodic	
fluctuations	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
is	
present	
.	

Hypercapnia	
may	
also	
be	
present	
during	
wakefulness	
in	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
can	
either	
be	
asymptomatic	
or	
present	
with	
complaints	
of	
dyspnea	
,	
chest	
tightness	
,	
or	
fatigue	
.	

Neurocognitive	
dysfunction	
may	
arise	
following	
use	
of	
narcotics	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Medications	
and	
substances	
that	
reduce	
respiratory	
drive	
may	
also	
alter	
the	
mechanics	
of	
the	
upper	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
airway	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
.	

By	
decreasing	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
,	
these	
agents	
may	
pre-	
cipitate	
or	
exacerbate	
OSA	
and	
CSA	
.	

It	
is	
not	
currently	
known	
whether	
chronic	
use	
of	
respiratory	
depressants	
will	
eventually	
give	
rise	
to	
pulmonary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
hypertension	
or	
cor	
pulmonale	
,	
but	
this	
seems	
unlikely

higher	
in

Studies	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
on

have	
generally	
found	
no

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
use	
of	
medications	
or

that	
impair	
respiration	
mechanics	
or

is	
the	
primary	
pathophysiologic	
factor	
responsible	
for	
hypoventilation	
and	
hypoxemia

There	
are	
significant	
inter	
-	
individual	
differences	
in	
sensitivity	
and	
tolerance	
to	
respira-	
tory	
depressants	
.	

Obesity	
or	
the	
presence	
of	
medical	
and	
neurologic	
diseases	
that	
may	
produce	
hypoventilation	
may	
further	
worsen	
hypercapnia	
/	
hypoxemia	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
who	
are	
hypercapnic	
and	
hypoxemic	
during	
wakefulness	
will	
generally	
become	
even	
more	
so	
during	
sleep	
,	
in	
particular	
REM	
sleep	
,	
but	
the	
relationship	
between

not	
sufficiently	
strong	
to	
have

in

Objective	
Findings	

The	
characteristic

finding	
is	
demonstration	
of	
sleep

hypoventilation	
by	
monitoring	
of	
PaCO2	
or	
acceptable

desat-	
uration	
during

unexplained	
by	
discrete

and	
hypopnea	
events	
is	
common	
.	

However	
,	
this	
finding	
alone	
is	
not	
sufficient	
to	
make	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
.	

Medication	
use	
can	
also	
produce	
obstructive	
or	
central	
apneas	
.	

Intermittent	
arousals

be

Subtypes	

The	
clinical	
presentation	
varies	
with	
the	
underlying	
disorder	
responsible	
for	
the	
sleep

Chronic

Patients	ORGANISM

are	
increasingly

with

Neurologic

,	
and	
chest

can	
produce	
hypoventilation	
due

Demographics	
The	
demographics	
of	
sleep

due

are	
a	
function	
of	
the

and	
degree	
of

of	
the

Thus

prevalence	
may	
be	
higher	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
greater

or	
neuromuscular	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY

Individuals

experience

Patients	ORGANISM

will	
generally	
become	
even

The

Complications	
Onset

the

of	
the

that	
impair

although	
substan-

variability	
in

is	
observed	
even	
within	
the

Although	
the

appears	
to	
increase	
with	
worsening	
sleep

the	
specific	
relationship	
between	
sleep

and	
morbidity

is	
not	
well	
defined	
.	

Many	
patients	ORGANISM
respond	
to	
assisted

,	
whereas	
hypercapnia	
may

with

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Pulmonary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
parenchymal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE

are	
characterized	
by	
altered	
lung	ORGAN
volumes	
(	
e.g.	
,	
reduced	
functional	
residual

)	
and	
abnormal	
ventilation

relationships	
,	
which	
can	
result	
in	
hypercapnia	
and	
hypoxemia	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Decreased	
lung	ORGAN
volume	
is	
associated	
with	
reduced	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
reserves	
that	
increase	
the	
risk	
of	
hypoxemia	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
sleep	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
altered	
pattern	
of	
ventilatory

muscle	ORGAN
acti-	
vation	
,	
particularly	
during

sleep	
when	
,	
due	
to	
reduced	
activation	
of	
the	
intercos-

accessory	
muscles	ORGAN
,	
there	
is	
a	
disproportionate	
ventilatory	
burden	
placed	
on	
the

This	
may	
lead	
to	
hypoventilation	
in

with

or	
in	
those	
with

In	
the	
latter	
,	
lung	ORGAN
hyperinfla-

Many

Finally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	
,	
if	
sufficiently

,	
may	
place	
the

near

on	
the

Thus

Sustained

Intermittent

Differential

The

includes	
all	
disorders	
which	
can	
give	
rise	
to	
hypoventila-

OHS

,	
and	
congenital

central

syndromes	
.	

OSA	
and	
CSA	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
by	
the	
periodic	
alterations	
in	
airflow	
and	
accompanying	
periodic	
fluctuations	
in	
SaO2	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
due	
to	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
is	
generally	
more	
sustained	
,	
usually	
several	
minutes	
or	
longer	
in	
duration	
.	

When	
more	
than	
one	
disorder	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
responsible	
for	
the	
ventilatory	
insufficiency	
during	
sleep	
,	
all	
pertinent	
diagnoses	
should	
be

to	
produce

such

,	
in

The	
value	
of	
routinely	
measuring	
PaCO2	
during

in	
these

is	
not

suspected	
of	
this

,	
other	
techniques	
of	
measuring	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
levels	
must	
be

Little

is	
available	
regarding	
the	
effect	
of	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

or	
noninvasive	
ventilation	
on	
the	
course	
of	
the	
underlying

Studies	
are	
needed	
to	
determine	
the

time	
to	
initiate	
these	
interventions	
and	
the

who	
will

Essential	
Features	
Significant	
hypoxemia	
during	
sleep	
is	
present	
and	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
secondary	
to	
a	
medical	
or	
neurological	
disorder	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
hypoxemia	
is	
not	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
sleep	
related	
breathing	
disorder	
(	
e.g.	
,	
OSA	
)	
.	

Although	
some	
amount	
of	
obstructive	
or	
central	
apnea	
may	
be	
present	
,	
these	
disorders	
are	
not	
thought	
to	
be	
pri-	
marily	
responsible	
for	
the	
hypoxemia	
during	
sleep	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
also	
exhibit	
hypoxemia	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Sleep

hypoventilation	
has	
not	
been	
documented	
(	
if	
so	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
is	
made	
)	
.	

The	
presentation	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
varies	
with	
the	
underly-	
ing	
medical	
or	
neurological	
disorders	
.	

Chronic

Acute	
exacerbations

and	
other	
causes	
of	
hypoventilation	
is	
generally	
sustained	
(	
several	
minutes	
or	
longer	
)	
,	
whereas	
sawtooth	
fluctuations	
of	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
saturation	
(	
typically	
less	
than	
one	
minute	
)	
characterize	
hypoxemia	
due

.	

Patients	ORGANISM
can	
either	
be

with	
complaints	
of	
nocturnal	
dyspnea	
,	
impaired

,

Polycythemia

severe	
chronic	
hypoxemia	
.

Some	
of	
the	
disorders	
causing	
hypoxemia	
are	
prevalent	
diseases	
and	
not	
uncommonly	
overlap	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
multi-	
ple

disorders	
are	
likely	
to	
experience	
greater	
severity	
and	
duration	
of	
sleep

hypoxemia	
than	
are	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
single	
disorder	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
Specific	
variations	
in	
the	
sleep

findings	
have	
not	
been	
described	
for	
the	
various	
etiologies	
.	

Demographics	
The	
demographics	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
are	
a	
function	
of	
the	
prevalence	
,	
clinical	
characteristics	
and	
degree	
of	
severity	
of	
the	
underlying	
conditions	
.	

Thus	
,	
prevalence	
may	
be	
higher	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
greater	
perturbations	
of	
pulmonary	ORGAN
function	
or	
neu-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
romuscular	
weakness	
.	

Individuals	
with	
chronic	
hypoxemia	
during	
wakefulness	
will	
experience	
even	
greater	
decrements	
of	
oxygenation	
during	
sleep	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Greater	
impairments	
of	
respiratory	
function	
are	
associated	
with	
greater	
risk	
for	
sleep

However	
,	
there	
is	
no	
recognized	
threshold	
of	
pulmonary	ORGAN
paren-	
chymal	
or	
vascular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
severity	
or	
extent	
of

weakness	
that	
ade-	

quately	
predicts	
the	
risk	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
in	
individual	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
who	
are	
hypoxemic	
during	
wakefulness	
will	
generally	
become	
even	
more	
so	
during	
sleep	
,	
especially	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Among	
the	
best	
predictors	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
are	
reduced	
baseline	
wake	
SaO2	
and	
hypercapnia	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
wake	
hypercapnia	
should	
be	
suspected	
of	
sleep

However	
,	
the	
relationship	
between	
wake

/	
PaCO2	
and

is	
not	
sufficiently

individual

although

to

the

relationship	
between	
sleep

and	
morbidity

is	
not	
well	
defined

Many

;	
in	
some	
,

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Hypoxemia	
may	
arise	
from	
a	
shunt	
physiology	
,	
ventilation	
-	
perfusion	
[	
V	
/	
Q	
]	
mismatch-	
ing	
,	
low	
mixed	
venous	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
and/or	
high	
altitude	
.	

Hypoventilation	
also	
gives	
rise	
to	
hypoxemia	
;	
however	
,	
when	
hypoventilation	
has	
been	
documented	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
should	
be	
assigned	
,	
rather	
than	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
.	

Pulmonary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
parenchymal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
diseases	
are	
characterized	
by	
altered	
lung	ORGAN
volumes	
(	
e.g.	
,	
reduced	
functional	
residual	
capacity	
)	
and	
abnormal	
ventilation	
/	
perfusion	
relationships	
,	
which	
can	
result	
in	
hypercapnia	
and	
hypoxemia	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Decreased	
lung	ORGAN
volume	
is	
associated	
with	
reduced	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
reserves	
that	
increase	
the	
risk	
of	
hypoxemia	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
sleep	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
altered	
pattern	
of	
ventilatory	
muscle	ORGAN
acti-	
vation	
,	
particularly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
when	
,	
due	
to	
reduced	
activation	
of	
the	
intercos-	
tal	
and	
accessory	
muscles	ORGAN
,	
there	
is	
a	
disproportionate	
ventilatory	
burden	
placed	
on	
the	
diaphragm	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

This	
may	
lead	
to	
hypoventilation	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
chest	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
wall	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
abnormalities	
or	
chronic	
obstructive	
pulmonary	ORGAN
disease	
.	

In	
the	
latter	
,	
lung	ORGAN
hyperinflation	
creates	
a	
mechanical	
disadvantage	
to	
the	
diaphragm	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

In	
sickle	
cell	CELL
anemia	
,	
decreased	
oxyhemo-	
globin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
affinity	
may	
partly	
contribute	
to	
hypoxemia	
.	

Many	
neurologic	
and	
neuromuscu-	
lar	
disorders	
are	
associated	
with	
impaired	
respiratory	
mechanics	
and	
reduced	
CO2	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
che-	
mosensitivity	
.	

Finally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	
,	
if	
sufficiently	
severe	
,	
may	
place	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
near	
or	
on	
the	
steep	
portion	
of	
the	
oxyhemoglobin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
dissociation	
curve	
where	
even	
rela-	
tively	
small	
decrements	
in	
arterial	AMINO_ACID

tension	AMINO_ACID
result	AMINO_ACID
in	AMINO_ACID
large	
decrements	
in	
oxyhe-	
moglobin	
saturation	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	
in	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
might	
have	
a	
relatively	
great	
impact	
on	
oxyhemoglobin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
saturation	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Various	
patterns	
of	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
(	
sustained	
,	
intermittent	
,	
or	
episodic	
)	
may	
be	
observed	
during

.	

The	
diagnosis	
is	
generally	
made	
on	
the	
basis	
of	
overnight	
oxim-	
etry	
(

,	
increased

ness

;	
however	
,	
the	
contribution	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
to	
the	
altered	
sleep	
architecture	
,	
if	
present	
,	
is	
uncertain	
.	

Daytime	
arterial	AMINO_ACID
blood	AMINO_ACID
gases	AMINO_ACID
may	
be	
normal	
or	
show	
hypoxia	
and	
hypercapnia	
.	

Nocturnal	
oxim-	
etry	
usually	
shows	
sustained	
periods	
of	
reduced	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
oxygen	
but	
clusters	
of	
more	
severe	
drops	
in	
the	
arterial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
oxygen	
saturation	
can	
occur	
every	
one	
to	
two	
hours	
due	
to	
worsening	
of	
breathing	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

A	
sawtooth	
pattern	
of	
briefer	
desaturations	
(	
typically	
less	
than	
one	
minute	
)	
suggests	
the	
presence	
of	
discrete	
events	
(	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	
)	
.	

Some	
sawtooth	
changes	
may	
be	
superimposed	
on	
low	
baseline	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
saturation	
but	
are	
not	
the	
predominant	
pattern	
.	

Chronic	
hypoxia	
can	
be	
associated	
with	
polycythemia	
.	

Electrocardiography	
,	
chest	
radiography	
,	
and	
echocardiography	
may	
demonstrate	
evidence	
of	
pulmonary	ORGAN

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
differential	
diagnosis	
encompasses	
all	
disorders	
which	
can	
give	
to	
hypoxemia	
during	
sleep	
.	

This	
includes	
pulmonary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE

and	
parenchymal	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
disorders	
,	
pulmonary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
vascular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE

disorders	
,	
OHS	
,	
use	
of

can	
suppress	
respiratory	
drive	
,	
and	
congenital	
or	
idiopathic	
central	
alveolar	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
hypoventilation	
syndromes	
.	

OSA	
and	
CSA	
syndromes	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
by	
the	
periodic	
alterations	
in	
airflow	
and	
accompanying	
periodic	
fluctuations	
in	
SaO2	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
oxygen	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
desaturation	
associated	
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	
is	
generally	
more	
sustained	
,	
usually	
several	
minutes	
or	
longer	
in	
duration	
.	

In	
cases	
when	
more	
than	
one	
disorder	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
responsible	
for	
the	
ventilatory	
insufficiency	
during

Snoring	
is	
a	
respiratory	
sound	
generated	
in	
the	
upper	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
during	
sleep	
that	
typically	
occurs	
during	
inspiration	
but	
may	
also	
occur	
in	
expiration	
;	
the	
snoring	
described	
here	
occurs	
without	
episodes	
of	
apnea	
,	
hypopnea	
,	
RERAs	
or	
hypoventilation	
.	

The	
intensity	
of	
snoring	
may	
vary	
and	
often	
will	
disturb	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
and	
even	
awaken	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
.	

Snoring	
in	
this	
context	
does	
not	
cause	
symptoms	
of	
daytime	
sleepiness	
or	
insomnia	
in	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
.	

This	
type	
of	
snoring	
has	
variously	
been	
referred	
to	
as	
habitual	
,	
primary	
or	
simple	
snoring	
.	

Snoring	
is	
a	
cardinal	
symptom	
of	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
.	

A	
designation	
of	
habitual	
snoring	
can	
not	
be	
made	
in	
those	
who	
exhibit	
symptoms	
(	
daytime	
sleepiness	
/	
fatigue	
or	
other	
related	
symptoms	
)	
or	
report	
possible	
breathing	
pauses	
,	
without	
objective	
mea-	
surement	
of	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
those	
individuals	
with	
snoring	
and	
comorbid	
cardiovascular	
disease	
(	
especially	
pulmonary	ORGAN
or	
systemic	
hypertension	
,	
cor-	
onary	
artery	
disease	
,	
or	
atrial	
fibrillation	
)	
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
the	
presence	
of	
OSA	
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
complaints	
of	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

Therefore	
,	
PSG	
or	
OCST	
is	
required	
in	
order	
to	
effectively	
rule	
out	
OSA	
in	
such	
populations	
.	

It	
should	
also	
be	
noted	
that	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
initially	
have	
isolated	
snoring	
may	
be	
at	
risk	
for	
developing	
OSA	
with	
aging	
or	
weight	
gain	
.	

Occasional	
snoring	
is	
almost	
universal	
.	

Estimates	
on	
snoring	
vary	
widely	
depending	
on	
its	
definition	
.	

The	
incidence	
of	
snoring	
in	
children	ORGANISM
is	
reported	
to	
be	
10	
%	
to	
12	
%	
.	

The	
Wisconsin	
cohort	
study	
reports	
habitual	
snoring	
in	
about	
24	
%	
of	
adult	
women	ORGANISM
and	
40	
%	
of	
adult	
men	ORGANISM
.	

Prevalence	
of	
snoring	
increases	
with	
age	
in	
both	
sexes	
,	
except	
that	
the	
prevalence	
of	
reported	
snoring	
starts	
to	
decrease	
again	
in	
men	ORGANISM
after	
70	
years	
of	
age	
.	

Some	
have	
hypothesized	
that	
his	
may	
be	
due	
to	
decreased	
hearing	
acuity	
in	
older	
individuals	
.	

Snoring	
is	
most	
common	
in	
adult	
men	ORGANISM
and	
is	
also	
linked	
to	
obesity	
.	

Nasal	
obstruc-	
tion	
increases	
the	
risk	
of	
snoring	
.	

Ingestion

or	
other

that

upper	
airway	TISSUE
muscle	TISSUE
tone	
predisposes	
an	
individual	
to	
snoring	
.	

Smoking	
,	
particularly	
in	
males	
,	
has	
also	
been	
shown	
to	
be	
a	
risk	
factor	
.	

Snoring	
has	
also	
been	
shown	
to	
increase	
during	
pregnancy	
.	

In	
children	ORGANISM
,	
an	
association	
has	
been	
reported	
between	
snoring	
and	
adenotonsillar	
hypertrophy	
.

there	
is	
vibration	
of

it

involve	
the

and

to	
have	
mor-	
phologic	
derangements	
of	
the

consistent	
with	
neurogenic	CANCER

.	

These	
are	
thought	
to	
be	
due	
to	
trauma	
from	
vibration	
.	

If	
PSG	
is	
performed	
,	
snoring	
tends	
to	
be	
loudest	
during	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
or	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Epidemiologic	
studies	
are	
difficult	
to	
interpret	
if	
sleep	
apnea	
was	
not	
excluded	
by	
PSG	
.	

Based	
on	
the	
current	
literature	
,	
habitual	
snoring	
in	
children	ORGANISM
may	
be	
associated	
with	
worse	
school	
performance	
,	
but	
conclusive	
evidence	
for	
this	
is	
lacking	
.	

Some	
studies	
have	
suggested	
that	
adult	
snorers	
may	
have	
a	
higher	
prevalence	
of	
cardiovas-	
cular	ORGAN
disease	
,	
including	
hypertension	
,	
stroke	
,	
and	
ischemic	
heart	ORGAN

.	

However	
,	
a	
large	
observational	
study	
in	
which	
all	
subjects	
underwent	
PSG	
found	
no	
increased	
risk	
of	
cardiovascular	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
morbidity	
or	
mortality	
with	
habitual	
snoring	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
one	
study	
found	
that	
snoring	
was	
associated	
with	
atherosclerosis	
of	
the	
carotid	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
,	
but	
this	
has	
not	
been	
confirmed	
by	
other	
studies	
.	

As	
snoring	
tends	
to	
increase	
during	
pregnancy	
,	
the	
impact	
of	
snoring	
on	
maternal	
health	
is	
of	
great	
interest	
.

Catathrenia	
Catathrenia	
,	
also	
known	
as	
sleep	
related	
groaning	
,	
is	
included	
in	
the	
SRBD	
section	
because	
it	
appears	
to	
be	
associated	
with	
prolonged	
expiration	
,	
usually	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
some	
studies	
have	
documented	
catathrenia	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

Typically	
,	
a	
deep	
inspiration	
is	
followed	
by	
prolonged	
expiration	
and	
a	
monotonous	
vocalization	
resembling	
groaning	
.	

The	
pattern	
is	
sometimes	
called	
bradypnea	
(	
low	
respiratory	
rate	
)	
.	

The	
affected	
individual	
is	
usually	
unaware	
of	
the	
problem	
,	
but	
clini-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
cal	
evaluation	
is	
sought	
due	
to	
complaints	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
or	
family	
members	
.	

The	
recurrent	
bradypneic	
episodes	
may	
resemble	
central	
apnea	
except	
that	
central	
apneas	
are	
not	
typically	
associated	
with	
vocalization	
.	

Catathrenia	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
rare	
and	
more	
common	
in	
men	ORGANISM
.	

Several	
episodes	
may	
occur	
nightly	
and	
often	
in	
clusters	
.	

The	
long	
-	
term	
consequences	
of	
catathrenia	
are	
unknown	
,	
but	
the	
disorder	
is	
primarily	
a	
social	
problem	
for	
the	
affected	
individual	
.	

The	
episodes	
of	
catathrenia	
are	
not	
associ-	
ated	
with	
sleep	
talking	
or	
body	
movement	
.	

No	
association	
with	
psychiatric	
disorders	
has	
been	
demonstrated	
.	

The	
onset	
of	
catathrenia	
has	
recently	
been	
reported	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
taking	
sodium	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

The	
clinical	
significance

this

unclear

Sleepiness	
predisposes	
an

to	
developing	
serious	
performance	
decrements	
in	
multiple	
areas	
of	
function	
,	
as

,	
and	
vehicular	
accidents	
.	

This	
section	
includes	
a	
group	
of	
disorders	
in	
which	
the	
primary	
complaint	
is	
daytime	
sleepiness	
not	
caused	
by	
disturbed	
nocturnal	
sleep	
or	
misaligned	
circadian	
rhythms	
.	

Other	
sleep	
disorders	
may	
be	
present	
,	
but	
they	
must	
be	
adequately	
treated	
before	
a	
diagnosis	
in	
this	
category	
can	
be	
established	
.	

In	
this	
nosology	
,	
the	
term	
hypersomnolence	
is	
used	
to	
describe	
the	
symptom	
of	
exces-	
sive	
sleepiness	
,	
whereas	
hypersomnia	
refers	
to	
specific	
disorders	
,	
such	
as	
idiopathic	
hypersomnia	
.	

Daytime	
sleepiness	
is	
defined	
as	
the	
inability	
to	
stay	
awake	
and	
alert	
during	
the	
major	
waking	
episodes	
of	
the	
day	
,	
resulting	
in	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
for	
sleep	
or	
unin-	
tended	
lapses	
into	
drowsiness	
or	
sleep	
.	

Sleepiness	
may	
vary	
in	
severity	
and	
is	
more	
likely	
to	
occur	
in	
sedentary	
,	
boring	
,	
and	
monotonous	
situations	
that	
require	
little	
active	
participation	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
aware	
of	
increasing	
sleepiness	
before	
falling	
asleep	
,	
whereas	
others	
can	
fall	
asleep	
with	
little	
or	
no	
prodromal	
symptoms	
(	
“	
sleep	
attacks	
”	
)	
.	

This	
group	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
sometimes	
can	
present	
following	
motor	
vehicle	
accidents	
attrib-	
utable	
to	
sleepiness	
.	

In	
some	
forms	
of	
hypersomnolence	
,	
sleepiness	
is	
associated	
with	
large	
increases	
in	
total	
daily	
amount	
of	
sleep	
without	
any	
genuine	
feeling	
of	
resto-	
ration	
.	

In	
others	
,	
sleepiness	
can	
be	
alleviated	
temporarily	
by	
naps	
but	
reoccurs	
shortly	
thereafter	
.	

In	
young	
children	ORGANISM
,	
sleepiness	
may	
express	
itself	
as	
excessively	
long	
night	
sleep	
or	
with	
the	
recurrence	
of	
previously	
discontinued	
daytime	
napping	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
may	
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	
paradoxically	
present	
with	
inattentiveness	
,	
emotional	
lability	
,	
hyperactive	
behavior	
,	
or	
decreased	
performance	
in	
school	
.	

In	
most	
cases	
,	
excessive	
sleepiness	
is	
a	
chronic	
symptom	
.	

It	
must	
occur	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
prior	
to	
diagnosis	
.	

The	
severity	
of	
daytime	
sleepiness	
can	
be	
quantified	
subjectively	
using	
severity	
scales	
such	
as	
the	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
and	
objectively	
using	
the

These	
measures	
do	
not	
always	
correlate	
with	
each	
other	
and	
must	
be	
used	
with	
appropriate	
clinical	
judgment	
.	

When	
applied	
in	
clinical	
settings	
,	
the	
MSLT	
is	
sensitive	
to	
sleep	
deprivation	
and	
circadian	
effects	
.	

It	
has	
not	
been	
validated	
as	
a	
diagnostic	
test	
in	
people	ORGANISM
who	
are	
habitually	
awake	
throughout	
the	
night	
and	
sleep	
during	
the	
day	
.	

Normal	
and	
abnormal	
ranges	
of	
sleep	
latencies	
have	
not	
been	
estab-	
lished	
when	
this	
test	
is	
administered	
at	
times	
other	
than	
the	
hours	
between	
8:00	
a.m.	
and	
6:00	
p.m.	

Normative	
data	
are	
not	
available	
for	
children	ORGANISM
younger	
than	
six	
years	
.	

The	
MSLT	
measures	
the	
physiological	
tendency	
to	
fall	
asleep	
in	
quiet	
situations	
.	

In	
the	
context	
of	
diagnosing	
central	
disorders	
of	
hypersomnolence	
,	
the	
MSLT	
should	
be	
con-	
ducted	
according	
to	
standardized	
procedures	
,	
as	
defined	
in	
the	
American	
Academy	
of	
Sleep	
Medicine	
(	
AASM	
)	
practice	
parameters	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
should	
be	
encour-	
aged	
to	
sleep	
as	
much	
as	
possible	
during	
the	
week	
and	
,	
especially	
,	
during	
the	
night	
prior	
to	
the	
MSLT	
.	

Delaying	
wake	
-	
up	
time	
and	
subsequent	
MSLT	
start	
time	
may	
be	
appropriate	
in	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
delayed	
sleep	
phase	
syndrome	
.	

It	
is	
strongly	
rec-	
ommended	
that	
adequate	
sleep	
be	
documented	
by	
sleep	
log	
and	
,	
whenever	
possible	
,	
actigraphy	
for	
a	
period	
of	
one	
to	
two	
weeks	
prior	
to	
the	
MSLT	
.	

MSLT	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
should	
be	
considered	
a	
continuum	
with	
values	
below	
five	
minutes	
generally	
considered	
as	
indicative	
of	
sleepiness	
and	
those	
over	
10	
minutes	
generally	
consid-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
ered	
indicative	
of

.	

In	
this	
section	
,	
a	
mean	
MSLT	
sleep	
latency	
of	
less	
than	
eight	
minutes	
is	
used	
to	
define	
sleepiness	
for	
diagnostic	
purposes	
.	

This	
value	
has	
been	
shown	
to	
be	
the	
best	
cutoff	
in	
the	
context	
of	
diagnosing	
narcolepsy	
,	
with	
approximately	
90	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
having	
a	
latency	
below	
this	
level

periods	
(	
SOREMPs	
)	
during	
the

is	
a	
more

in	
narcolepsy	
than	
is	
a	
mean	
sleep

less	
than	
or	
equal

The	
results	
of	
an	
MSLT	
should	
be	
carefully	
interpreted	
in	
the	
context	
of	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
history	
and	
the	
complaint	
of	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

The	
maintenance

wakefulness	
test	
is	
a	
measure	
of	
the	
ability	
to	
remain	
awake	
during	
the	
daytime	
in	
a	
darkened	
,	
quiet	
environment	
and	
is	
usually	
administered	
to	
assess	
response	
to	
treatment	
.	

It	
should	
not	
be	
used	
for	
diagnostic	
purposes

A	
24

hour	
continuous	
sleep	
recording	
or	
an	
actigraphic	
recording	
of	
at	
least	
one	
week	
is	
useful	
in	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
idiopathic	
hypersomnia	
.	

In	
all	
cases	
in	
which	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
hypersomnolence	
is	
to	
be	
made	
,	
a	
review

,	
and

disorders

be	
performed

In	
this	
edition	
of	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
the	
preferred	
names	
of	
certain	
central	
disorders	
of	
hypersomnolence	
have	
been	
changed	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
nar-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
colepsy	
has	
been	
divided	
into	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
and	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
rather	
than	
narcolepsy	
with	
and	
without	
cataplexy	
.	

This	
change	
is	
predicated	
on	
the	
concept	
that	
absence	
of	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
(	
orexin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
)	
is	
a	
fundamental	
marker	
of	
the	
most	
precisely	
defined	
category	
of	
the	
disorder	
.	

Because	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
without	
cataplexy	
will	
also	
have	
low	
cerebrospinal	
fluid	
(	
CSF	
)	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
,	
the	
use	
of	
the	
term	
“	
narcolepsy	
with	
cataplexy	
”	
or	
“	
narcolepsy	
-	
cataplexy	
”	
is	
inappropriate	
.	

The	
change	
is	
not	
intended	
to	
imply	
that	
the	
presence	
or	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	
is	
unimportant	
clinically	
nor	
that	
mea-	
suring	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
is	
obligatory	
.	

The	
motivation	
behind	
the	
decision	
to	
eliminate	
the	
subcategories	
of	
idiopathic	
hypersomnia	
is	
discussed	
in	
the	
appropriate	
section	
.	

The	
decision	
to	
use	
Kleine	
-	
Levin	
syndrome	
as	
the	
preferred	
name	
in	
place	
of	
recurrent	
hypersomnia	
is	
based	
on	
data	
suggesting	
that	
the	
condition	
is	
fairly	
homo-	
geneous	
,	
as	
well	
as	
the	
lack	
of	
definite	
evidence	
for	
other	
major	
subcategories	
of	
the	
disorder	
.

The	
patient	ORGANISM
has	
daily	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
to	
sleep	
or	
daytime	
lapses	
into	
sleep	
occurring	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months.1

of	
the	
following	
:

under	
Essential

a

8	
minutes	
and	
two	
or	
more

Notes	
.	

In	
young	
children	ORGANISM
,	
narcolepsy	
may	
sometimes	
present	
as	
excessively	
long	
night	
sleep	
or	
as	
resumption	
of	
previously	
discontinued	
daytime	
napping	
.	
.	

If	
narcolepsy	
type	
I	
is	
strongly	
suspected	
clinically	
but	
the	
MSLT	
criteria	
of	
B1	
are	
not	
met	
,	
a	
possible	
strategy	
is	
to	
repeat	
the	
MSLT	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
1	CELL
is	
a	
disorder	
primarily	
characterized	
by	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepi-	
ness	
and	
signs	
of	
REM	
-	
sleep	
dissociation	
,	
the	
most	
specific	
of	
which	
is	
cataplexy	
.	

It	
has	
now	
been	
firmly	
established	
that	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
1	CELL
is	
caused	
by	
a	
deficiency	
of	
hypothalamic	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
(	
orexin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
)	
signaling	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
low	
or	
undetectable	
concen-	
trations	
of	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
in	
the	
CSF	
compose	
a	
specific	
disease	
population	
with	
a	
single	
etiology	
and	
relatively	
homogenous	
clinical	
and	
polysomnographic	
features	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
sleepiness	
and	
low	
or	
absent	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	

levels	
are	
classified	
as	
having	
nar-	
colepsy	
type	
1	
,	
even	
if	
they	
do	
not	
manifest	
cataplexy	
.	

Excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
is	
the	
cardinal	
symptom	
,	
and	
often	
the	
most	
disabling	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
experience	
repeated	
daily	
episodes	
of	
an	
irrepressible	
need	
to	
sleep	
or	
lapses	
into	
sleep	
.	

Most	
patients	ORGANISM
awaken	
refreshed	
after	
a	
sleep	
episode	
but	
begin	
to	
feel	
sleepy	
again	
after	
variable	
times	
.	

Sleepiness	
is	
most	
likely	
to	
occur	
in	
monotonous	
situations	
that	
require	
no	
active	
participation	
;	
for	
example	
,	
watching	
television	
or	
riding	
in	
a	
car	
.	

Physical	
activity	
may	
temporarily	
suppress	
the	
urge	
to	
sleep	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
sleepiness	
manifests	
as	
sudden	
irresistible	
sleep	
“	
attacks	
”	
that	
may	
occur	
in	
unusual	
situations	
such	
as	
eating	
or	
walking	
.	

Often	
,	
such	
sleep	
attacks	
occur	
on	
a	
background	
of	
overall	
sleepiness	
.	

Even	
when	
seemingly	
awake	
,	
many	
nar-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
colepsy	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
lapses	
in	
vigilance	
,	
sometimes	
in	
combination	
with	
automatic	
behavior	
,	
such	
as	
writing	
gibberish	
or	
interrupting	
a	
conversation	
with	
a	
completely	
different	
topic	
.	

Sleepiness	
generally	
has	
a	
serious	
impact	
on	
the	
ability	
of	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
to	
function	
in	
educational	
,	
social	
,	
and	
occupational	
situations	
.	

Because	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
rarely	
examined	
during	
an	
attack	
of	
cataplexy	
,	
its	
presence	
needs	
to	
be	
established	
based	
on	
the	
clinical	
interview	
alone	
.	

Cataplexy	
is	
defined	
as	
more	
than	
one	
episode	
of	
generally	
brief	
(	
<	
2	
minutes	
)	
,	
usually	
bilaterally	
symmetrical	
sudden	
loss	
of	
muscle	ORGAN
tone	
with	
retained	
consciousness	
.	

The	
episodes	
are	
precipitated	
by	
strong	
emotions	
,	
usually	
positive	
,	
with	
almost	
all	
patients	ORGANISM
reporting	
some	
episodes	
precipitated	
by	
emotions	
associated	
with	
laughter	
.	

The	
finding	
of	
transient	
reversible

of	
deep	
tendon	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
reflexes	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
during	
an	
attack	
,	
if

,	
is	
a	
strong	
diagnostic	
finding	
.	

In	
children	ORGANISM
(	
and	
rarely	
adults	
)	
,	
cataplexy	
may	
present	
close	
to	
disease	
onset

which	
clearly	
are	
not	
related	
to	
emotion	
.	

Facial	
and	
masticatory	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
movements	
may	
occur	
.	

In	
children	ORGANISM
,	
anticipation	
of	
a	
reward	
is	
a	
common	
precipitant	
.	

It	
is	
important	
to	
use	
child	
-	
appropriate	
contexts	
and	
language	
when	
trying	
to	
elicit	
a	
history	
of	
cataplexy	
in	
children	ORGANISM
.	

The	
cataplexy	
phenotype	
differs	
widely	
between	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
ranging	
from	
sporadic	
partial	
attacks	
triggered	
by	
laughter	
,	
to	
frequent	
complete	
attacks	
of	
collapse	
brought	
about	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
emotions	
.	

In	
the	
vast	
majority	
of	
attacks	
,	
cataplexy	
is	
bilateral	
,	
although	
patients	ORGANISM
sometimes	
report	
one	
side	
of	
the	
body	
to	
be	
more	
affected	
than	
the	
other	
.	

Partial	
attacks	
can	
be	
very	
subtle	
and	
sometimes	
only	
recognized	
by	
experi-	
enced	
observers	
such	
as	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
partner	
.	

Neck	
weakness	
,	
producing	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
drop	
,	
is	
a	
common	
complaint	
,	
whereas	
facial	
weakness	
may	
lead	
to	
sagging	
of	
the	
jaw	CANCER
and	
dysarthria	
.	

Respiratory	
muscles	
are	
not	
involved	
although	
patients	ORGANISM
sometimes	
describe	
shortness	
of	
breath	
when	
symptomatic	
.	

Attacks	
start	
abruptly	
and	
usually	
build	
up	
over	
several	
seconds	
,	
especially	
in	
attacks	
producing	
complete	
peripheral	ORGANISM
weakness	
and	
collapse	
.	

Positive	
motor	
phenomena	
are	
not	
uncommon

or	
small

,	
particularly	
of	
the	
face	
.	

Although	
many	
emotions	
can	
potentially	
lead	
to	
cataplexy	
,	
those	
associated	
with	
mirth	
are	
usually	
the	
most	
potent	
.	

Laughing	
out	
loud	
,	
telling	
a	
joke	
,	
and	
making	
a	
witty	
remark	
are	
typical	
examples	
.	

The	
frequency	
of	
cataplexy	
is	
variable	
,	
ranging	
from	
less	
than	
one	
attack	
per	
month	
to	
more	
than	
20	
attacks	
per	
day	
.	

Cataplexy	
is	
generally	
short	
-	
lived	
,	
lasting	
a	
matter	
of	
seconds	
,	
with	
the	
vast	
majority	
of	
attacks	
lasting	
less	
than	
two	
minutes	
.	

However	
,	
if	
a	
particular	
trigger	
continues	
,	
consecutive	
attacks	
may	
merge	
together	
to	
form	
what	
seems	
to	
be	
one	
long	
episode

,	
especially	
anti-	
depressants	
,	
can	
result	
in	
“

”	
in	
which	
long

happen	
virtually	
continuously

Associated	
Features	
In	
addition	
to	
sleepiness	
and	
cataplexy	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
often	
report	
several	
other	
symptoms	
,	
none	
of	
which	
are	
specific	
for	
the	
disorder	
.	

Many	
patients	ORGANISM
report	
disruption	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
which	
can	
sometimes	
be	
of	
major	
concern	
.	

Although	
sleep	
onset	
is	
rarely	
a	
problem	
,	
an	
inability	
to	
maintain	
continuous	
sleep	
is	
very	
common	
.	

33	
%	
to	
80	
%	
of	
narcolepsy	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
hypnagogic	
hallucinations	
and/or	
sleep	
paralysis	
.	

Hypnagogic	
hallucinations	
are	
defined	
as	
vivid	
dreamlike	
expe-	
riences	
occurring	
at	
the	
transition	
from	
wake	
to	
sleep	
.	

Typically	
,	
hypnagogic	
halluci-	
nations	
have	
a	
multimodal	
or	
“	
holistic	
”	
character	
,	
often	
combining	
visual	
,	
auditory	
,	
and	
tactile	
phenomena	
.	

Hypnopompic	
hallucinations	
are	
similar	
but	
occur	
at	
sleep	
to	
wake	
transitions	
.	

Sleep	
paralysis	
describes	
the	
disturbing	
temporary	
inability	
to	
move	
voluntary	
muscles	ORGAN
at	
sleep	
-	
wake	
transitions	
.	

Despite	
being	
awake	
and	
conscious	
of	
the	
sleeping	
environment	
,	
it	
is	
impossible	
for	
subjects	
to	
move	
their	
limbs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
or	
even	
open	
their	
eyes	ORGAN
.	

The	
experience	
may	
last	
for	
several	
minutes	
and	
can	
be	
very	
distressing	
.	

Other	
symptoms	
may	
include	
ptosis	
,	
blurred	
vision	
,	
and	
diplopia	
,	
presumably	
as	
a	
result	
of	
sleepiness	
.	

Epidemiological	
studies	
have	
shown	
that	
obesity	
is	
a	
common	
symptom	
of	
narco-	
lepsy	
.	

Around	
disease	
onset	
,	
an	
unexplained	
increase	
in	
body	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
weight	
is	
often	
observed	
.	

Obesity	
(	
defined	
as	
a	
body	
mass	
index	
≥	
30	
kg	
/	
m2	
)	
occurs	
more	
than	
twice	
as	
often	
in	
narcoleptic	CANCER
populations	CANCER
as	
in	
control	
groups	
.	

An	
increased	
frequency	
of	
several	
other	
sleep	
abnormalities	
has	
been	
described	
in	
narcolepsy	
,	
including	
sleep	
talking	
,	
periodic	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movements	
of	
sleep	
,	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
,	
and	
REM

behavior	
disor-	
der	
.	

There	
is	
an	
increased	
prevalence	
of	
depressive	
symptoms	
,	
although	
there	
are	
con-	
flicting	
reports	
on	
how	
often	
these	
symptoms	
qualify	
as	
a	
clinical	
depression	
.	

Recent	
studies	
point	
to	
a	
high	
level	
of	
anxiety	
disorders	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
,	
with	
panic	
attacks	
or	
social	
phobias	
in	
about	
20	
%	
.	

More	
than	
half	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
report	
severe	
fatigue	
,	
which	
can	
be	
distinct	
from	
sleepiness	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Narcolepsy	
type	
1	
due	
to	
a	
medical	
condition	
:	

This	
condition	
is	
primarily	
associated	
with	
central	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
nervous	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
system	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
(	
CNS	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
)	
disorders	
,	
including	
autoimmune	
or	
paraneoplastic	
disorders	
associated	
with	
anti

Ma2	
or	
antiaquaporin4	
antibodies	
,	
and	
tumors	CANCER
or	
other	
lesions	
of	
the	
hypothalamus	ORGAN
.	

In	
addition	
,	
undetectable	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
association	
with	
sleepiness	
after	
severe	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
trauma	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

The	
condition	
must	
fulfill	
criteria	
for	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
and	
be	
attributable	
to	
another	
medical	
disorder	
.	

Narcolepsy	
without	
cataplexy	
with	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
:	
Narcolepsy	
type

should	
be	
diagnosed	
,	
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	
,	
if	
diagnostic	
criteria	
A	
and	
B2	CELL
are	
fulfilled	
.	

Demographics	
Narcolepsy	
with	
cataplexy	
occurs	
in	
0.02	
%	
to	
0.18	
%	
of	
the	
United	
States	
and	
western	
European	
populations	
.	

A	
lower	
prevalence	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
Israel	
,	
whereas	
narco-	
lepsy	
with	
cataplexy	
may	
be	
slightly	
more	
common	
in	
Japan	
(	
0.16	
%	
to	
0.18	
%	
)	
.	

Both	
sexes	
are	
affected	
,	
with	
a	
slight	
preponderance	
of	
males	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Several	
unproven	
precipitating	
factors	
have	
been	
suggested	
in	
case	
reports	
,	
including

,	
sustained	
sleep	
deprivation	
,	
unspecified	
viral	
illness	
,	
and	
sudden	
changes	
in

patterns	
.	

Several	
studies	
have	
pointed	
to	
seasonal	
patterns	
in	
the	
onset	
of	
narcolepsy	
,	
which	
may	
point	
to	
a	
specific	
environmental	
trigger	
.	

Recent	
studies	
have	
shown	
an	
increase	
in	
antibodies	
against	
beta

hemolytic	
streptococcus	
,	
which	
were	
strongest	
around	
onset	
of	
narcolepsy	
and	
decreased	
with	
disease	CANCER
duration	
,	
suggesting	
that	
streptococcal	
infections	
may	
constitute	
an	
environmental	
trigger	
.	

There	
have	
been	
reports	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL

occurring	
after	
vaccination	
against	
H1N1	
associated

enza	
,	
but	
a

causal	
association	
has	
not	
yet	
been	
established

Tribbles

in	
14	
%	
to	
26	
%	
of

but	
the	
significance	
is	
uncertain	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
At	
the	
genetic	
level	
,	
narcolepsy	
with

is	
closely	
associated	
with	
the	
human	ORGANISM

subtypes	
DR2

.	

These	
two	
subtypes	
are	
always	
found	
together	
in	
whites	
and	
Asians	
,	
but	
in	
blacks	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
,	
DQB1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
*	
0602	
is	
more	
specifically	
associated	
with

.	

Almost	
all	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
cataplexy	
are	
positive	
for

this

Other

also	
have	
less	
striking	
associations	
.	

For	
example	
,	
DQB1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT

is	
associated	
with	
increased

Genomewide

as

.	

There	
is	
a	
low	
prevalence	
of

the	
risk	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL

is	
approximately	
1	
%

2	
%	
.	

When	
compared	
to	
the	
population	
prevalence	
,	
this	
indicates	
a	
tenfold	
to	
fortyfold	
increase	
in	
risk	
.	

This	
increased	
risk	
can	
not	
be	
explained	
solely	
by	
HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT

effects	
,	
suggesting	
the	
exis-	
tence	
of	
other	
genetic	
factors

Multiplex

uncommon

In	
most	
cases	
,	
normal

So	
far	
,	
only	
a	
single	
case	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL

has	
been	
described	
in

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
usually	
occurs	
after	
five	
years	
of	
age	
and	
most	
typically	
between	
ages	
10	
and	
25	
years	
.	

However	
,	
a	
bimodal	
distribution	
in	
the	
age	
at	
onset	
has	
been	
described	
in	
some	
populations	
with	
a	
first	
peak	
occurring	
at	
adolescence	
(	
age	
15	
years	
)	
and	
a	
second	
at	
the	
age	
of	
35	
years	
.	

Recent	
studies	
highlight	
the	
fact	
that	
narcolepsy	
,	
and	
especially	
cataplexy	
,	
in	
young	
children	ORGANISM
may	
present	
somewhat	
differently	
,	
resulting	
in	
delayed	
diagnosis	
and	
erroneously	
high	
estimates	
of	
age	
of	
onset	
.	

Sleepiness	
is	
usually	
the	
first	
symptom	
to	
manifest	
.	

Cataplexy	
most	
often	
occurs	
within	
one	
year	
of	
onset	
but	
in	
rare	
cases	
,	
may	
precede	
the	
onset	
of	
sleepiness	
or	
commence	
up	
to	
40	
years	
later	
.	

Hypnagogic	
hallucinations	
,	
sleep	
paralysis	
,	
and	
disturbed	
noctur-	
nal	
sleep	
often	
manifest	
later	
in	
the	
course	
of	
the	
disease	CANCER
.	

When	
left	
untreated	
,	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
is	
often	
socially	
disabling	
and	
isolating	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
have	
a	
tendency	
to	
fail	
in	
school	
and	
are	
often	
dismissed	
from	
their	
jobs	
.	

Driving	
may	
be	
avoided	
for	
fear	
of	
a	
motor	
vehicle	
accident	
.	

The	
inability	
to	
sleep	
at	
night	
may	
further	
contribute	
to	
a	
loss	
of	
control	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
over	
their	
schedule	
.	

Depression	
and	
weight	
gain	
also	
are	
common	
.	

In	
most	
cases	
,	
symptoms	
gradually	
develop	
over	
several	
years	
.	

When	
the	
clinical	
picture	
has	
fully	
developed	
,	
there	
are	
usually	
only	
minor	
fluctuations	
in	
severity	
.	

Cataplexy	
may	
lessen	
with	
age	
,	
or	
occasionally	
increase	
in	
frequency	
and	
severity	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
In	
recent	
years	
,	
increasing	
attention	
has	
been	
given	
to	
the	
clinical	
presentation	
of	
nar-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
colepsy	
in	
childhood	
.	

Narcolepsy	
with	
cataplexy	
is	
infrequent	
prior	
to	
the	
age	
of	
four	
years	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
clinical	
presentation	
in	
children	ORGANISM
may	
be	
different	
from	
that	
of	
adults	
.	

In	
young	
children	ORGANISM
,	
sleepiness	
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
assess	
,	
and	
may	
express	
itself	
as	
excessively	
long	
night	
sleep	
,	
or	
the	
recurrence	
of	
previously	
discontinued	
daytime	
napping	
.	

Moreover	
,	
children	ORGANISM
may	
paradoxically	
present	
with	
hyperactive	
behavior	
,	
behavioral	
problems	
or	
decreased	
performance	
in	
school	
.	

Inattentiveness	
,	
lack	
of	
energy	
,	
insomnia	
,	
bizarre	
hallucinations	
,	
or	
a	
combination	
thereof	
can	
lead	
to	
a	
psy-	
chiatric	
misdiagnosis	
of	
schizophrenia	
or	
depression	
.	

In	
this	
population	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
ancillary	
symptoms	
such	
as	
sleep	
paralysis	
or	
hypnagogic	
hallucinations	
may	
also	
be	
difficult	
to	
confirm	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
child	
’s	
verbal	
ability	
.	

Precocious	
puberty	
and	
obesity	
may	
also	
develop	
around	
the	
time	
of	
symptom	
onset	
.	

REM	
sleep	
behavior	
dis-	
order	
or	
REM	
sleep	
without	
atonia	
may	
also	
be	
manifest	
at	
the	
time	
of	
symptom	
onset	
.	

Cataplexy	
may	
be	
very	
severe	
around	
disease	
onset	
and	
appear	
phenotypically	
differ-	
ent	
from	
typical	
episodes	
seen	
in	
adulthood	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
typical	
attacks	
triggered	
by	
positive	
emotions	
,	
children	ORGANISM
can	
also	
present	
with	
weakness	
involving	
the	
face	
,	
eyelids	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
and	
mouth	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
not	
clearly	
associated	
with	
emotion	
.	

Together	
with	
tongue	ORGAN
protrusion	
,	
this	
characteristic	
pattern	
has	
been	
termed	
a	
cataplectic	
facies	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
with	
cataplexy	
may	
also	
display	
positive	
motor	
phenomena	
,	
ranging	
from	
perioral	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
dyskinetic	
or	
dys-	
tonic	
movements	
to	
frank	
stereotypies	
.	

In	
children	ORGANISM
,	
anticipation	
of	
reward	
may	
also	
be	
a	
precipitant	
.	

The	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
in	
children	ORGANISM
may	
be	
complicated	
because	
of	
diffi-	
culties	
performing	
the	
MSLT	
,	
and	
lack	
of	
normative	
values	
in	
children	ORGANISM
younger	
than	
six	
years	
.	

If	
the	
MSLT	
shows	
equivocal	
results	
,	
repeating	
it	
after	
a	
time	
interval	
may	
be	
helpful	
.	

Given	
these	
difficulties	
,	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
measurements	
are	
of	
particular	
value	
,	
as	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
are	
low	
or	
undetectable	
very	
shortly	
after	
disease	
onset	
in	
children	ORGANISM
as	
well	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
It	
is	
now	
firmly	
established	
that	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
1	CELL
is	
caused	
by	
deficiencies	
in	
hypo-	
cretin	
signaling	
,	
most	
likely	
due	
to	
a	
selective	
loss	
of	
hypothalamic	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
pro-	
ducing	
neurons	
.	

Several	
animal	
models	
lacking	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
neurotransmission	
demon-	
strate	
narcolepsy	
,	
indicating	
a	
causal	
relationship	
.	

The	
vast	
majority	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
(	
90	
%	
to	
95	
%	
)	
with	
narcolepsy	
and	
cataplexy	
have	
undetectable	
or	
low	
(	
<	
110	
pg	
/	
mL	
)	
levels	
of	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
in	
the	
CSF	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
without	
cataplexy	
can	
be	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deficient	
as	
well	
,	
although	
at	
a	
much	
lower	
frequency	
,	
and	
are	
thus	
also	
classified	
as	
narcolepsy	
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	
type	
1	
.	

The	
strong	
HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
association	
in	
narcolepsy	
has	
led	
to	
the	
hypothesis	
that	
auto-	
immunity	
is	
a	
likely	
etiological	
mechanism	
,	
potentially	
explaining	
the	
selectivity	
of	
neuronal	CELL
destruction	
in	
the	
hypothalamus	ORGAN
.	

However	
,	
definitive	
proof	
for	
autoimmunity	
has	
not	
been	
obtained	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Narcolepsy	
type	
1	
is	
essentially	
defined	
as	
a	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deficiency	
syndrome	
,	
which	
is	
reflected	
in	
the	
need	
for	
objective

in	
the	
clinical	
criteria	
.	

This	
require-	
ment	
is	
further	
driven	
by	
the	
fact	
that	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
require	
lifelong	
treatment	
with	
potentially	
addictive	
medications	
,	
underscoring	
the	
importance	
of	
objective	
confirma-	
tion	
of	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

It	
is	
strongly	
recommended	
that	
the	
MSLT	
be	
preceded	
by	
at	
least	
one	
week	
of	
acti-	
graphic	
recording	
with	
a	
sleep	
log	
to	
establish	
whether	
the	
results	
could	
be	
biased	
by	
insufficient	
sleep	
,	
shift	
work	
,	
or	
another	
circadian	
sleep	
disorder	
.	

In	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
,	
the	
MSLT	
demonstrates	
a	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
of	
less	
than	
eight	
minutes	
and	
typically	
less	
than	
five	
minutes	
.	

Meta	
-	
analysis	
shows	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
in	
narcoleptic	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
cataplexy	
of	
3.1	
±	
2.9	
minutes	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
two	
or	
more	
SOREMPs	
must	
be	
present	
.	

Recent	
data	
suggest	
that	
a	
SOREMP	
within	
15	
minutes	
of	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
is	
a	
highly	
specific	
finding	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
another	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
but	
with	
low	
sensitivity	
.	

Therefore	
,	
the	
criteria	
for	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
allow	
the	
“	
replacement	
”	
of	
one	
SOREMP	
in	
the	
MSLT	
with	
a	
SOREMP	
on	
the	
preceding	
poly-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
somnogram	
.	

For	
the	
correct	
interpretation	
of	
MSLT	
findings	
,	
the	
recordings	
should	
be	
performed	
with	
the	
following	
conditions	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
must	
be	
free	
of	
drugs	
that	
influence	
sleep	
for	
at	
least	
14	
days	
(	
or	
at	
least	
five	
times	
the	
half	
-	
life	
of	
the	
drug	
and	
longer	
-	
acting	
metabolite	
)	
,	
confirmed	
by	
a	
urine	
drug	
screen	
;	
(	
2	
)	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
sched-	
ule	
must	
have	
been	
standardized	
and	
,	
if	
necessary	
,	
extended	
to	
a	
minimum	
of	
seven	
hours	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
(	
longer	
for	
children	ORGANISM
)	
for	
at	
least	
seven	
days	
before	
polysom-	

nography	
(	
preferably	
documented	
by	
sleep	
log	
and	
,	
whenever	
possible	
,	
actigraphy	
)	
;	
and	
(	
3	
)	
nocturnal	
polysomnography	
should	
be	
performed	
on	
the	
night	
immediately	
preceding	
the	
MSLT	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
that	
could	
mimic	
the	
diagnostic	
features	
of	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
.	

Sleep	
time	
during	
polysomnography	
should	
be	
curtailed	
as	
little	
as	
possible	
with	
the	
goal	
of	
at	
least	
seven	
hours	
asleep	
.	

The	
overnight	
poly-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
somnogram	
may	
demonstrate	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
amount	
of	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
,	
and	
there	
may	
be	
a	
disruption	
of	
the	
normal	
sleep	
pattern	
,	
with	
frequent	
awakenings	
.	

REM	
sleep	
without	
atonia	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Measuring	
CSF	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
of	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
a	
highly	
specific	
and	
sensitive	
test	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
.	

Hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
can	
be	
measured	
in	
crude	
CSF	
,	
using	
a	
commercially	
available	
radioimmunoassay	
.	

When	
using	
the	
Stanford	
reference	
sample	
,	
values	
less	
than	
110	
pg	
/	
mL	
are	
highly	
specific	
.	

Alternatively	
,	
a	
laboratory	
may	
elect	
to	
obtain	
control	
data	
themselves	
,	
in	
which	
case	
a	
level	
of	
less	
than	
33	
%	
of	
mean	
control	
values	
is	
considered	
abnormal	
.	

Issues	
concerning	
the	
standardization	
of	
CSF	
hypocre-	
tin	
measurements	
remain	
,	
but	
extensive	
protocols	
are	
available	
.	

Low	
CSF	
hypocre-	
tin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
values	
are	
occasionally	
observed	
in	
seriously	
ill	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
other	
disorders	
and	
should	
be	
interpreted	
within	
the	
clinical	
context	
.	

HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
typing	
of	
narcoleptic	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
cataplexy	
almost	
always	
shows	
the	
presence	
of	
HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
DQB1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
*	
0602	
(	
and	
DR2	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
or	
DRB1	
*	
1501	
in	
whites	
and	
Asians	
)	
,	
but	
this	
is	
not	
diagnostic	
for	
narcolepsy	
.	

Approximately	
25	
%	
of	
the	
normal	
Caucasian	
population	
,	
12	
%	
of	
the	
Japanese	
population	
,	
and	
38	
%	
of	
the	
black	
population	
are	
positive	
for	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
.	

HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
typing	
could	
be	
considered	
when	
a	
spinal	
tap	
is	
contemplated	
to	
assess	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
values	
:	
if	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
is	
HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
-	
negative	
,	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
are	
most	
likely	
normal	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
In	
the	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	
,	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
can	
be	
diagnosed	
based	
on	
the	
pres-	
ence	
of	
hypersomnolence	
and	
low	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
.	

When	
cataplexy	
is	
absent	
and	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
are	
normal	
or	
unknown	
,	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
should	
be	
diagnosed	
.	

Cataplexy	
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
cataplexy	
-	
like	
episodes	
that	
are	
occasionally	
observed	
in	
normal	
individuals	
.	

For	
example	
,	
feelings	
of	
muscle	ORGAN
weakness	
are	
some-	
times	
reported	
when	
healthy	
subjects	
laugh	
out	
loud	
.	

In	
genuine	
cataplexy	
,	
episodes	
most	
often	
occur	
with	
a	
significant	
frequency	
,	
and	
are	
associated	
with	
loss	
of	
muscle	ORGAN
tone	
.	

Cataplexy	
should	
be	
differentiated	
from	
hypotension	
,	
transient	
ischemic	
attacks	
,	
drop	
attacks	
,	
akinetic	
seizures	
,	
neuromuscular	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
disorders	
,	
vestibular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disorders	
,	
psycho-	
logical	
or	
psychiatric	
disorders	
,	
and	
sleep	
paralysis	
.	

Clear	
improvement	
with	
antide-	
pressant	
medications	
may	
favor	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
cataplexy	
in	
difficult	
cases	
.	

Sleepiness	
may	
be	
secondary	
to	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
,	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
,	
shift	
work	
,	
the	
effects	
of	
substances	
or	
medications	
,	
or	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

Many	
of	
these	
conditions	
can	
result	
in	
early	
onset	
REM	
sleep	
as	
well	
.	

When	
cataplexy	
is	
present	
,	
these	
disorders	
do	
not	
preclude	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
.	

When	
there	
is	
a	
questionable	
history	
of	
cataplexy	
in	
such	
cases	
,	
either	
comorbid	
conditions	
should	
be	
adequately	
treated	
before	
performing	
an	
MSLT	
or	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
should	
be	
measured	
.	

Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	
Idiopathic	
hypersomnia	
is	
differentiated	
from	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
by	
the	
absence	
of	
cat-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
aplexy	
and	
the	
lack	
of	
two	
or	
more	
SOREMPs	
on	
the	
MSLT	
.	

In	
contrast	
with	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
have	
narcolepsy	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
idiopathic	
hypersomnia	
generally	
have	
high	
sleep	
efficiency	
,	
sleep	
drunkenness	
,	
and	
long	
,	
unrefreshing	
naps	
.	

In	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
,	
there	
is	
no	
cataplexy	
,	
and	
normalizing	
sleep	
time	
elim-	

inates	
the	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

Chronic	
fatigue	
syndrome	
and	
depression	
may	
mimic	
narcolepsy	
but	
do	
not	
show	
the	
typical	
MSLT	
findings	
.	

Malingering	
and	
substance	
abuse	
disorder	
should	
be	
considered	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
try	
to	
mislead	
the	
clinician	
in	
order	
to	
obtain	
stimulant	
medications	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Ten	
percent	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
with	
cataplexy	
have	
normal	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
in	
the	
CSF	
,	
which	
suggests	
that	
CSF	
levels	
either	
do	
not	
perfectly	
reflect	
brain	ORGAN
hypocretin	ORGAN
neurotransmission	
or	
that	
narcolepsy	
with	
cataplexy	
can	
be	
caused	
by	
factors	
other	
than	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deficiency	
.	

The	
cause	
of	
the	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
cell	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
destruction	
remains	
unknown	
,	
although	
an	
autoimmune	
-	
mediated	
mechanism	
is	
suspected	
.	

Levels	
of	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
have	
been	
reported	
in	
the	
blood	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
of	
some	
subjects	
.	

The	
development	
of	
serum	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE

to	
determine	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deficiency	
would	
provide	
a	
less

Essential	
Features	
Narcolepsy	CELL

is	
characterized	
by	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
and	
abnormal	
man-	
ifestations	
of	
REM	
sleep	
on	
polysomnography

Cataplexy	
is	
absent	
,	
although	
some	
atypical	
sensations	
of	
weakness	
triggered	
by	
unusual	
emotions	
such	
as	
stress	
and	
anger	
may	
be	
reported	
.	

Refreshing	
daytime	
naps	
are	
characteristic	
.	

An	
essential	
feature	
of	
the	
diagnosis	
is	
the	
presence	
of	
a	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
less	
than

equal	
to	
eight

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Narcolepsy	
type

due	
to	
a	
medical	
condition	
:	

This	
condition	
fulfills	
criteria	
for	
nar-	
colepsy	
type	
2	
and	
is	
attributable	
to	
another	
medical	
disorder	
.	

Neurologic	
disorders	
associated	
with	
narcolepsy	
type

include	
tumors	CANCER
or	
sarcoidosis	
of	
the	
hypothalamus	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE

In	
disorders	
associated	
with	
both

and	
narco-	
lepsy	
type

,	
such	
as	
myotonic	
dystrophy	
or	
Prader

,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL

should	
only	
be	
made	
if	
abnormal	
MSLT	
findings	
persist	
after	
the	
sleep	
apnea	
is	
adequately	
treated	
.	

In	
all	
cases	
,	
especially	
with	
complex	
problems	
such	
as	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
trauma	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
clinical	
judgment	
should	
be	
used	
to	
determine	
if	
the	
development	
of	
narcolepsy	
was	
a	
mere	
coincidence	
or	
was	
triggered	
by	
the	
event	
or	
disorder	
.	

Demographics	
The	
exact	
prevalence	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
is	
uncertain	
.	

Cases	
of	
narcolepsy	
without	
cat-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
aplexy	
represent	
15	
%	
to	
25	
%	
of	
the	
clinic	
narcoleptic	
population	
.	

A	
population	
-	
based	
study	
suggested	
a	
higher	
percentage	
(	
36	
%	
)	
,	
corresponding	
to	
a	
point	
prevalence	
of	
20.5/100,000	
.	

Population	
-	
based	
studies	
have	
shown	
that	
approximately	
4	
%	
to	
9.5	
%	
of	
adults	
may	
have	
multiple	
SOREMPs	
during	
random	
MSLTs	
,	
but	
shift	
workers	
and	
subjects	
with	
sleep	
deprivation	
or	
sleep	
apnea	
were	
included	
in	
the	
studies	
.	

Although	
both	
sexes	
can	
be	
affected	
,	
the	
prevalence	
may	
be	
slightly	
higher	
in	
men	ORGANISM
.	

The	
age	
of	
onset	
mirrors	
that	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
As	
discussed	
below	
,	
about	
24	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
but	
no	
cataplexy	
will	
have	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
and	
almost	
all	
of	
these	
will	
be	
positive	
for	
the	
HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
DQB1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
*	
0602	
antigen	
.	

These	
patients	ORGANISM
probably	
share	
a	
common	
pathogenesis	
with	
narcolepsy	
with	
cataplexy	
and	
should	
be	
classified	
as	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
1	CELL
.	

Underlying	
genetic	
and	
envi-	
ronmental	
factors	
associated	
with	
other	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
are	
unknown	
.	

Environmental	
precipitating	
factors	
are	
suspected	
from	
case	
reports	
but	
have	
never	
been	
proven	
to	
trigger	
narcolepsy	
without	
cataplexy	
.	

Among	
the	
most	
commonly	
reported	
triggers	
are	
head	CANCER
trauma	CANCER
and	
unspecified	
viral	
illnesses	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

The	
detailed	
genetic	
pattern	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
is	
unknown	
.	

Relatives	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
may	
be	
more	
likely	
to	
experience	
partial	
narcolepsy	
symptoms	
compatible	
with	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
typically	
occurs	
during	
adolescence	
.	

In	
about	
10	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
cataplexy	
will	
develop	
later	
in	
the	
course	
of	
the	
disease	CANCER
,	
necessitating	
a	
change	
in	
diagnosis	
to	
narco-	
lepsy	
type	
1	
.	

Most	
of	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
will	
,	
if	
tested	
,	
have	
absent	
or	
intermediate	
levels	
of	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
.	

In	
a	
cohort	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
without	
cataplexy	
in	
whom	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
status	
was	
known	
,	
33	
%	
of	
those	
with	
low	
levels	
later	
developed	
cataplexy	
,	
compared	
with	
18	
%	
with	
intermediate	
levels	
and	
only	
1	
%	
with	
normal	
levels	
.	

When	
left	
untreated	
,	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
is	
socially	
disabling	
and	
isolating	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
have	
a	
ten-	
dency	
to	
fail	
in	
school	
and	
are	
often	
dismissed	
from	
their	
jobs	
.	

Driving	
may	
be	
avoided	
for	
fear	
of	
a	
motor	
vehicle	
accident	
.	

The	
inability	
to	
sleep	
at	
night	
may	
further	
contrib-	
ute	
to	
a	
loss	
of	
control	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
over	
their	
schedule	
.	

Depression	
and	
weight	
gain	
also	
are	
common	
.	

Central

Hypersomnolence	
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	
Developmental	
Issues	
Children	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
will	
typically	
present	
with	
a	
reappearance	
of	
regular	
daytime	
napping	
after	
naps	
had	
been	
discontinued	
.	

In	
all	
pediatric	
cases	
,	
one	
should	
consider	
the	
possibility	
of	
an	
evolving	
disorder	
with	
the	
development	
of	
cataplexy	
over	
time	
.	

Once	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
develops	
clear	
cataplexy	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
should	
be	
changed	
to	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
.	

Limited	
information	
is	
available	
on	
narcolepsy	
type	
2	
prior	
to	
adolescence	
.	

Descriptions	
of	
the	
experience	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
or	
hypnagogic	
halluci-	ORGANISM
nations	
are	
very	
difficult	
to	
evoke	
in	
young	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
and	
normative	
data	
are	
not	
avail-	
able	
for	
the	
MSLT	
in	
children	ORGANISM
younger	
than	
six	
years	
of	
age	
.	

In	
peripubertal	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adolescents	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
is	
often	
challenging	
.	

The	
most	
common	
causes	
of	
short	
sleep	
latencies	
,	
often	
with	
multiple	
SOREMPs	
on	
the	
MSLT	
,	
are	
chronic	
sleep	
depri-	
vation	
and	
delayed	
sleep	
phase	
disorder	
.	

Behavioral	
problems	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
the	
onset	
of	
the	
disorder	
,	
and	
symptoms	
may	
be	
hidden	
by	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
.	

Inattentiveness	
,	
lack	
of	
energy	
,	
insomnia	
,	
bizarre	
hallucinations	
,	
or	
a	
combination	
thereof	
can	
lead	
to	
a	
psychiatric	
misdiagnosis	
of	
schizophrenia	
or	
depression	
.	

If	
the	
MSLT	
shows	
equivocal	
results	
,	
repeating	
it	
after	
a	
time	
interval	
may	
be	
helpful	
,	
as	
SOREMPs	
often	
emerge	
later	
in	
children	ORGANISM
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Narcolepsy	
type	
2	
is	
most	
likely	
a	
heterogeneous	
disorder	
.	

Approximately	
24	
%	
of	
nar-	

coleptic	
patients	ORGANISM
without	
cataplexy	
have	
a	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
concentration	
,	
and	
another	
8	
%	
have	
intermediate	
levels	
(	
>	
110	
pg	
/	
mL	
but	
≤	
200	
pg	
/	
mL	
)	
.	

The	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
status	
of	
most	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
is	
unknown	
(	
those	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
are	
known	
to	
have	
absent	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
are	
classified	
as	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
1	CELL
)	
.	

Therefore	
,	
there	
will	
be	
a	
subgroup	
of	
about	
one	
fourth	
to	
one	
third	
of	
narcolepsy	
type	
2	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
will	
have	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deficiency	
,	
presumably	
from	
loss	
of	
the	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
-	
producing	
neurons	CELL
.	

This	
group	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
can	
not	
be	
accurately	
separated	
clinically	
or	
by	
labora-	
tory	
tests	
(	
other	
than	
CSF	
Hcrt-1

)	
from	
the	
majority	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
without	
cataplexy	
who	
have	
normal	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
.	

Although	
those	
with	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
have	
a	
younger	
age	
of	
onset	
and	
their	
MSLT	
shows	
shorter	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
with	
more	
SOREMPs	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
in	
comparison	
with	
those	
with	
normal	
levels	
,	
there	
is	
too	
much	
overlap	
between	
the	
groups	
for	
these	
differences	
to	
be	
helpful	
diagnostically	
in	
individual	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

One	
hundred	
percent	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
are	
positive	
for	
HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
DQB1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
*	
0602	
.	

About	
26	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
normal	
levels	
are	
also	
HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
posi-	
tive	
,	
a	
percentage	
not	
higher	
than	
that	
seen	
in	
the	
normal	
population	
.	

The	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
the	
remainder	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
have	
normal	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
is	
unknown	
.	

It	
is	
possible	
some	
may	
have	
partial	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deficiency	
severe	
enough	
to	
cause	
sleepiness	
but	
not	
severe	
enough	
to	
result	
in	
cataplexy	
or	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
.	

However	
,	
support	
for	
this	
hypothesis	
is	
lacking	
in	
that	
there	
are	
no	
major	
differences	
in	
clinical

In	
the

of	
a

(	
CSF	
Hcrt-1

,	
the	
number

was	
decreased	
but	
not	
as	
much	
as	
in	
cases	
of	
narcolepsy	
with	
cataplexy

Objective	
Findings	

It	
is	
strongly	
rcommended	
that	
the	
MSLT	
be	
preceded	
by	
at	
least	
one	
week	
of	
acti-	
graphic	
recording	
with	
a	
sleep	
log	
to	
establish	
whether	
the	
results	
could	
be	
biased	
by	
insufficient	
sleep	
,	
shift	
work	
,	
or	
another	
circadian	
sleep	
disorder	
.	

The	
MSLT	
demon-	
strates	TISSUE
a	
mean	
latency	
of	
less	
than	
eight	
minutes	
,	
typically	
less	
than	
five	
minutes	
,	
with	
two	
or	
more	
SOREMPs	
or	
one	
SOREMP	
together	
with	
a	
SOREMP	
on	
the	
preceding	
polysomnogram	
.	

Meta	
-	
analysis	
shows	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
in	
narcoleptic	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
cataplexy	
of	
3.1	
±	
2.9	
minutes	
.	

Recent	
data	
suggest	
that	
a	
SOREMP	
within	
15	
minutes	
of	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
is	
a	
highly	
specific	
finding	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
another	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
but	
with	
low	
sensitivity	
.	

Therefore	
,	
the	
criteria	
for	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
allow	
the	
“	
replacement	
”	
of	
one	
SOREMP	
in	
the	
MSLT	
with	
a	
SOREMP	
on	
the	
preceding	
poly-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
somnogram	
.	

For	
the	
correct	
interpretation	
of	
MSLT	
findings	
,	
the	
recordings	
should	
be	
performed	
with	
the	
following	
conditions	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
must	
be	
free	
of	
drugs	
that	
influence	
sleep	
for	
at	
least	
14	
days	
(	
or	
at	
least	
five	
times	
the	
half	
-	
life	
of	
the	
drug	
and	
longer	
-	
acting	
metabolite	
)	
,	
confirmed	
by	
a	
urine	
drug	
screen	
;	
(	
2	
)	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
sched-	
ule	
must	
have	
been	
standardized	
and	
,	
if	
necessary	
,	
extended	
to	
a	
minimum	
of	
seven	
hours	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
(	
longer	
for	
children	ORGANISM
)	
for	
at	
least	
seven	
days	
before	
polysom-	

nography	
(	
preferably	
documented	
by	
sleep	
log	
and	
,	
whenever	
possible	
,	
actigraphy	
)	
;	
and	
(	
3	
)	
nocturnal	
polysomnography	
should	
be	
performed	
on	
the	
night	
immediately	
preceding	
the	
MSLT	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
that	
could	
mimic	
the	
diagnostic	
features	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
.	

Sleep	
time	
during	
polysomnography	
should	
be	
curtailed	
as	
little	
as	
possible	
,	
with	
the	
goal	
of	
at	
least	
seven	
hours	
asleep	
.	

The	
overnight	
poly-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
somnogram	
may	
demonstrate	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
amount	
of	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
,	
and	
there	
may	
be	
a	
disruption	
of	
the	
normal	
sleep	
pattern	
,	
with	
frequent	
awakenings	
.	

REM

without	
atonia	
may	
be	
present

patients	ORGANISM
with

but	
no	
cataplexy	
will	
have	
low

levels	
,	
the

that	
an	
HLA-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
positive	
patient	ORGANISM
will	
have	
low	
Hcrt-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
is	
only	
0.56	
.	

Therefore	
the	
HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
status	
of	
a	
patient	ORGANISM
can	
not	
be	
used	
to	
diagnose	
narcolepsy	
type	
2	
nor	
to	
predict	
with	
high	
probability	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s

;	
if

,	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
will	
almost	
certainly	
be

and	
the

will	
be	
unnecessary	
.	

Approximately	
24	
%	
of	
narcoleptic	
patients	ORGANISM
without	
cataplexy	
have	
a	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
concentration	
and	
another	
8

have

(

)	
.	

If	
the	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
of	
such	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
known	
to	
be	
low	
,	
they	
are	
classified	
as	
narcolepsy	CELL

,	
but	
the	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
status	
will	
not	
be	
known	
for	
most	
of	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

Possible	
indications	
for	
considering	
measuring	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
as	
a	
diag-	
nostic	
procedure	
would	
be	
the	
presence	
of	
disorders	
such	
as	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
or	
the	
use	
of	
psychotropic	
medications	
that	
may	
complicate	
interpretation	
of	
an	
MSLT	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Narcolepsy	
type	
1	
is	
diagnosed	
if	
cataplexy	
is	
present	
or	
the	
CSF	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
levels	
are	
known	
to	
be	
low	
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
idiopathic	
hyper-	
somnia	
may	
have	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
on	
MSLT	
similar	
to	
those	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
,	
but	
have	
fewer	
than	
two	
SOREMPs	
on	
MSLT	
and	
the	
preceding	
polysomnogram	
combined	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
narcolepsy	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
idiopathic	
hypersomnia	
generally	
have	
high	
sleep	
efficiency	
,	
sleep	
drunkenness	
,	
and	
long	
,	
unrefreshing	
naps	
.	

Sleepiness	
may	
be	
secondary	
to	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
(	
OSA	
)	
,	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
,	
shift	
work	
,	
the	
effects	
of	
substances	
or	
medications	
,	
or	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

Many	
of	
these	
conditions	
can	
result	
in	
early	
-	
onset	
REM	
sleep	
,	
so	
their	
clinical	
and	
polysomnographic	
exclusion	
is	
essential	
before	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
is	
made	
.	

However	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
does	
not	
preclude	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
if	
daytime	
sleepiness	
and	
REM	
abnormalities	
persist	
after	
adequate	
treatment	
of	
the	
initial	
disorder	
.	

Chronic	
fatigue	
syndrome	
and	
depression	
may	
mimic	
narcolepsy	
but	
do	
not	
show	
the	
typical	
MSLT	
findings	
.	

Malingering	
and	
substance	
abuse	
disorder	
should	
be	
considered	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
try	
to	
mislead	
the	
clinician	
in	
order	
to	
obtain	
stimulant	
medications	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Excluding	
the	
minority	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
definite	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deficiency	
,	
the	
underlying	
biology	
of	
narcolepsy	
without	
the	
presence	
of	
cataplexy	
is	
unknown	
.	

It	
is	
not	
estab-	
lished	
whether	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
is	
a	
homogeneous	
or	
heterogeneous	
condition	
.	

It	
is	
uncertain	
whether	
or	
not	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
partial	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deficiency	
not	
iden-	
tifiable	
from	
CSF	
measurements	
.	

Further	
advances	
in	
classification	
will	
depend	
on	
answers	
to	
these	
unknowns	
.	

Further	
studies	
on	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
are	
needed	
to	
determine	
the	
cause	
of	
the	
hypersomnolence	
and	
the	
risk	
of	
development	
of	
cataplexy	
over	
time

.	

A	
high	
sleep	
efficiency	
(	
≥

)	
on	
the

is	
a	
supportive	
finding	
(

.	
.	

The	
total	
24

hour	
sleep	
time	
required	
for	
diagnosis	
may	
need	
to	
be	
adapted	
to

for	
normal	
changes	
in	
sleep	
time	
associated	
with

Clinical	
judgment

deciding	
if	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
should	
be	
considered	
to	
have	
idiopathic

(	
IH

.	

Great	
caution	
should	
be	
exercised	
to	
exclude	
other	
conditions	
that	
might	
mimic	
the	
disorder	
.	

A	
repeat	
MSLT	
at	
a

date	
is	
advisable	
if	
the	
clinical	
suspicion	
for

A	
prolonged	
and	
severe	
form	
of

inertia	
,	
historically	
known	
as

Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
The	
2005	
2nd	
edition	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
divided	
IH	
into	
two	
disorders	
:	
IH	
with	
long	
sleep	
time	
,	
and	
IH	
without	
long	
sleep	
time	
.	

IH	
is	
likely	
a	
heterogeneous	
condition	
,	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
which	
is	
currently	
unknown	
.	

However	
,	
recent	
studies	
suggest	
that	
a	
division	
of	
the	
disorder	
based	
on	
the	
length	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
lacks	
validity	
.	

Comparison	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
≥	
10	
hours	
of	
sleep	
to	
those	
with	
<	
10	
hours	
show	
no	
differences	
in	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
scores	
,	
MSLT	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
,	
or	
percentage	
with	
sleep	
drunkenness	
,	
unrefreshing	
naps	
,	
hypnago-	
gic	
hallucinations	
,	
or	
sleep	
paralysis	
.	

The	
only	
reported	
differences	
are	
that	
the	
group	
with	
long	
sleep	
is	
somewhat	
younger	
and	
thinner	
,	
with	
lower	
Horne	
-	
Ostberg	
scores	
and	
marginally	
higher	
sleep	
efficiency	
.	

If	
MSLT	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
are	
not	
used	
as	
a	
diagnostic	
criterion	
,	
the	
distribution	
of	
latencies	
is	
unimodal	
,	
suggesting	
no	
sepa-	
rate	
subtypes	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
an	
actigraphy	
study	
has	
shown	
that	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
IH	
tend	
to	
overestimate	
their	
sleep	
time	
by	
a	
mean	
of	
0.99	
hours	
,	
thus	
making	
the	
fundamental	
criterion	
for	
distinguishing	
between	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
long	
and	
shorter	
sleep	
inaccurate	
.	

Clinicians	
may	
wish	
to	
continue	
to	
note	
sleep	
duration	
as	
an	
important	
clinical	
feature	
,	
but	
the	
caveats	
discussed	
above	
should	
be	
clearly	
considered	
.	

Any	
future	
separation	
of	
IH	
into	
distinct	
conditions	
must	
await	
advances	
in	
understanding	
the	
underlying	
biology	
.	

Demographics	
Prevalence	
and	
incidence	
of	
IH	
are	
not	
known

In	
contrast	
to	
narcolepsy	
,	
the	
disorder	
is	
not	
known	
to	
be	
HLA	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
associated	
,	
and	
no

Familial	
Patterns	

A	
familial	
predisposition	
to	
hypersomnia	
has	
been	
reported	
but	
rigorous	
studies	
have	
not	
been	
performed	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
IH	
in	
different	
series	
is	
16.6–21.2	
years	
.	

Once	
established	
,	
the	
disorder	
is	
generally	
stable	
in	
severity	
and	
long	
lasting	
,	
although	
a	
spontaneous	
remission	
rate	
of	
14	
%	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
one	
series	
.	

Complications	
are	
mostly	
social	
and	
professional	
,	
and	
include	
poor	
work	
or	
school	
performance	
,	
reduced	
earnings	
,	
and	
loss	
of	
employment	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
IH	
frequently	
develops	
in	
adolescence	
.	

Exclusion	
of	
other	
causes	
of	
hypersomno-	
lence	
in	
that	
age	
group	
,	
including	
delayed

,	
obstructive

,	
insufficient

syndrome	
,	
and	
use	
of	
recreational

,	
is	
essential	
.	

Early	
in	
the	
development	
of	
narcolepsy	
,	
SOREMPs	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
may	
not	
be	
present	
on

;	
therefore	
,	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
need	
to	
be	
reclassified	
later	
as	
narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
.	

If	
the	
24

total	
sleep	
time	
is	
used	
to	
confirm	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
IH	
in	
a	
child	
or	
adolescent	
,	
normal	
values	
may	
need	
to	
be	
adapted	
to	
account	
for	
changes	
in

associated	
with	
stages	
of	
development	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
of	
IH	
is	
unknown	
.	

Neurochemical	
studies	
measuring	
monoamine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
metabolites	
in	
the	
CSF	
have	
been	
inconclusive	
.	

CSF	
hypocretin-1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
concentrations	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
IH	
are	
normal	
.	

CSF	
histamine	
levels	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
low	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
and	
IH	
,	
but	
a	
recent	
study	
did	
not	
confirm	
these	
findings	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnographic	
monitoring	
generally	
demonstrates	
NREM	CANCER
and	
REM	
sleep	
in	
expected	
proportions	
with	
normal	
REM	
latency	
.	

Total	
sleep	
time	
is	
often	
prolonged	
.	

Sleep	
apnea	
should	
be	
either	
absent	
or	
adequately	
treated	
before	
diagnosing	
this	
disor-	
der	
,	
with	
special	
attention	
paid	
to	
excluding	
significant	
respiratory	
effort	
related	
arous-	
als	
.	

The	
MSLT	
should	
not	
show	
more	
than	
one	
SOREMP	
(	
or	
none	
if	
a	
SOREMP	
was	
observed	
on	
the	
preceding	
night	
’s	
polysomnogram	
(	
PSG	
)	
)	
.	

The	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
on	
the	
MSLT	
is	
usually	
shorter	
than	
in	
controls	
but	
longer	
than	
in	
most	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
nar-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
colepsy	
,	
averaging	
8.3	
and	
7.8	
minutes	
in	
two	
large	
studies	
.	

In	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
MSLT	
mean	
latencies	
>	
8	
minutes	
,	
prolonged	
sleep	
monitoring	
should	
be	
performed	
by	
polysomnography	
(	
24	
hours	
)	
or	
wrist	
actigraphy	
(	
7	
days	
with	
unre-	
stricted

)	
after	
correction	
of	
sleep	
deprivation	
,	
exclusion	
of	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
and	
discontinuation	
of	
sedating	
medication	
as	
required	
for	
an

Total	
24

in	
adults

660	
minutes	
(	
note	
that	
the	
use	
of	
24

monitoring	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of

has	
been	
validated	
against

,	
but	
the	
use	
of	
seven	
days	
of

validation	
)	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
IH	
may	
be	
confused	
with	
OSA	
,	
especially	
when	
respiratory	
-	
related	
arousals	
(	
rather	
than	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	
)	
are	
present	
.	

Narcolepsy	CELL
type	CELL
2	CELL
is	
distinguished	
from	
IH	
by	
the	
presence	
of	
two	
or	
more	
sleep	
onset	
REM	
periods	
on	
the	
MSLT	
or	
preceding	
PSG	
.	

Insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
must	
be	
carefully	
excluded	
by	
extending	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
sleep	
before	
testing	
.	

Historical	
information	
,	
physical	
examination	
,	
and	
,	
if	
indicated	
,	
laboratory	
testing	
including	
brain	ORGAN
imaging	
should	
help	
rule	
out	
hypersomnolence	
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disorder	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
posttraumatic	
hypersomnolence	
,	
residual	
hyper-	
somnolence	
following	
adequate	
treatment	
of	
sleep	
apnea	
,	
and	
sleep	
fragmentation	
due	
to	
pain	
may	
mimic	
IH	
.	

Hypersomnolence	
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
must	
be	
considered	
and	
ruled	
out	
by	
discontinuation	
of	
possible	
causative	
agents	
,	
if	
clinically	
appropriate	
.	

Hypersomnia	
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	
disorder	
should	
be	
consid-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
ered	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
psychiatric	
condition	
,	
most	
typically	
depression	
.	

The	
complaint	
of	
excessive	
sleepiness	
and	
prolonged	
sleep	
may	
be	
rather	
similar	
to	
that	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
IH	
,	
except	
that	
it	
may	
vary	
from	
day	
to	
day	
and	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
poor	
sleep	
at	
night	
.	

The	
MSLT	
in	
hypersomnia	
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	
disorder	
does	
not	
demonstrate	
a	
short	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
.	

Chronic	
fatigue	
syndrome	
is	
character-	
ized	
by	
persistent	
or	
relapsing	
fatigue	
that	
does	
not	
resolve	
with	
sleep	
or	
rest	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
clearly	
complain	
of	
fatigue	
rather	
than	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
and	
the	
mean	
MSLT	
sleep	
latency	
is	
normal	
.	

Long	
sleepers	
feel	
fully	
refreshed	
and	
do	
not	
experience	
daytime	
sleepiness	
if	
they	
are	
allowed	
to	
sleep	
as	
long	
as	
they	
need	
,	
in	
contrast	
with	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
IH	
who	
continue	
to	
feel	
sleepy	
regardless	
of	
prior	
sleep	
duration	
.	

Unresolved

experiences	
at	
least	
two	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
excessive	
sleepiness	
and	
sleep	
duration	
,	
each	
persisting	
for

Episodes	
recur	
usually	
more	
than	
once	
a	
year	
and	
at	
least	
once	
every	
18	
months	
.	

C.	ORGANISM

The	
patient	ORGANISM
has	
normal	
alertness	
,	
cognitive	
function	
,	
behavior	
,	
and	
mood	
between	
episodes	
.	

D.	

The	
patient	ORGANISM
must	
demonstrate	
at	
least	
one	
of	
the	
following	
during	
episodes	
:	
.	

Cognitive	
dysfunction	
.	
.	

Altered

E.	ORGANISM

The	
hypersomnolence	
and

symptoms	
are	
not	
better	
explained	
by	
another

,	
other	
medical

or	
psychiatric	
disorder	
(	
especially

)	
,	
or

.	

Essential	
Features	
Kleine	
-	
Levin	
syndrome	
is	
characterized	
by	
relapsing	
-	
remitting	
episodes	
of	
severe	
hypersomnolence	
in	
association	
with	
cognitive	
,	
psychiatric	
,	
and	
behavioral	
distur-	
bances	
.	

A	
typical	
episode	
lasts	
a	
median	
10	
days	
(	
range	
,	
2.5–80	
days	
)	
,	
with	
rare	
epi-	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
sodes	
lasting	
several	
weeks	
to	
months	
.	

The	
first	
episode	
is	
often	
triggered	
by	
an	
infec-	
tion	
or	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
intake	
,	
with	
further	
episodes	
recurring	
every	
1–12	
months	
(	
median	
three	
months	
)	
for	
years	
.	

During	
episodes	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
sleep	
as	
long	
as	
16	
to	
20	
hours	
per	
day	
,	
waking	
or	
getting	
up	
only	
to	
eat	
and	
void	
(	
incontinence	
is	
not	
observed	
)	
.	

They	
remain	
rousable	
,	
but	
are	
irritable	
if	
prevented	
from	
sleeping	
.	

When	
they	
are	
awake	
during	
episodes	
,	
most	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
exhausted	
,	
apathetic	
,	
confused	
,	
and	
slow	
in	
speaking	
and	
answering	
.	

Anterograde	
amnesia	
is	
typical	
.	

Almost	
all	
report	
a	
dreamlike	
,	
altered	
perception	
of	
the	
environment	
(	
derealization	
)	
.	

Less	
commonly	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
eat	
ravenously	
(	
66	
%	
,	
although	
one	
third	
eat	
less	
)	
,	
are	
hypersexual	
(	
53	
%	
,	
principally	
men	ORGANISM
)	
,	
childish	
,	
depressed	
(	
53	
%	
,	
predominantly	
women	ORGANISM
)	
,	
and	
anxious	
at	
being	
left	
alone	
and	
seeing	
strangers	
,	
and	
experience	
hallucinations	
and	
delusions	
(	
30	
%	
)	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
are	
remark-	
ably	
normal	
between	
episodes	
with	
regard	
to	
sleep	
,	
cognition	
,	
mood	
,	
and	
eating	
.	

The	
disease	
typically	
resolves	
after	
a	
median	
of	
14	
years	
,	
except	
in	
adult	
-	
onset	
cases	
,	
when	
the	
course	
may	
be	
more	
prolonged	
.	

The	
simultaneous	
occurrence	
of	
all	
these	
symp-	
toms	ORGANISM
is	
the	
exception	
rather	
than	
the	
rule	
,	
with	
hypersomnolence	
being	
more	
char-	
acteristic	
at	
the	
disease	
onset	
and	
during	
the	
first	
part	
of	
the	
episodes	
,	
and	
disinhib-	
ited	
behaviors	
being	
evident	
during	
only	
a	
few	
episodes	
.	

In	
occasional	
cases	
,	
isolated	
recurrent	
hypersomnolence	
may	
be	
the	
only	
symptom	
.	

Amnesia	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
transient	
dysphoria	
,	
or	
elation	
with	
insomnia	
may	
signal	
the	
termination	
of

Features	
Physical

is	
unremarkable

occupational	
impairment	
during

is	
often	
severe

,	
and	
Complications	
Early	
adolescence	
(	
second	
decade	
)	
is	
the	
usual	
age	
of	
onset	
.	

The	
course	
of	
Kleine-	

Levin	
syndrome	
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
severe	
sleepiness	
,	
lasting	
up	
to	
several	
weeks	
,	
with	
normal	
functioning	
between	
episodes

Several	
long

suggest	
an	
often

Postmortem

has	
been	
performed	
in	
only	
four	
cases	
,	
with	
inconsistent

One	
subject	
showed	
significant	
perivascular	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
lymphocytic	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
infiltrations	
in	
the	
hypothalamus	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
,	
amygdala	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
and	
the	
grey

of	
the	
temporal	
lobes	ORGAN
;	
a	
second	
demonstrated	
similar	
infiltrations	
in	
the	
thalamus	ORGAN
;	
and	
a	
third	
in	
the	
diencephalon	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
and	
the	
midbrain	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
with	
a	
suggestion	
of	
mild

,	
a	
smaller	
locus

An

,	
the	
complaint

occurs	
daily

is	
usually

Unresolved

and	
Future	
Directions	

The	
pathophysiology	
of	
this	
disorder	
is	
not	
known

Evidence	
to	
date	
suggests	
that	
a	
localized

multifocal	
encephalopathy	
occurs	
during	
episodes	
of

a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
or	
type

should	
be	
used	
rather	
than

in	
whom	
it	
is	
not	
possible

Essential	
Features	
Patients	ORGANISM
with	
this	
disorder	
have	
excessive	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
or	
excessive	
napping	
that	
is	
attributable	
to	
a	
coexisting	
medical	
or	
neurological	
disor-	
der	
.	

Daytime	
sleepiness	
may	
be	
of	
variable	
severity	
and	
may	
resemble	
that	
of	
narco-	
lepsy	
(	
i.e.	
,	
refreshing	
naps	
)	
or	
idiopathic	
hypersomnia	
(	
i.e.	
,	
long	
periods	
of	
unrefresh-	
ing	
sleep	
)	
.	

Sleep	
paralysis	
,	
hypnagogic	
hallucinations

automatic	
behavior	
may	
be	
present

narcolepsy	
(	
type	
1	
or

2	
)	
due	
to	
a	
medical	
condi-	
tion

In	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
both	
sleep	
related	
breathing	
disorders	
and	
hypersomnia	
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disorder	
,	
the

diagnosis	
should	
be	
made	
only	
if	
the	
hypersomnolence	
persists	
after	
adequate	
treatment	
of	
the	
sleep

Hypersomnia	
due

If	
so	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
should	
be	
insomnia

Cases	
of	
hypersomnolence	
that	
are	
due	
to	
the	
side	
effects	
of	
dopaminergic	
agents	
should	
be	
coded	
as	
hypersomnia	
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
.	

In	
other	
cases	
,	
however	
,	
hypersomnolence	
is	
likely	
of	
central	
origin	
and	
should	
be	
classified	
in	
this	
section

Parkinson	CANCER
disease	CANCER
patients	CANCER
with	
an	
MSLT

consistent	
with	
narco-

,	
with	
one	
meta

analysis	
suggesting	
a	
frequency	
of	
28	
%	
of	
TBI	CANCER
patients	CANCER
.	

In	
some	
cases	
this	
may	
be	
caused	
by

)	
in

is	
high	
(

)	
.	

The	
nature	
of	
the	
relationship	
between	
TBI	CANCER
and	
OSA	
remains	
undefined	
.	

Therefore	
,	
control	
of	
other	
potential

is	
necessary	
prior	
to	
making	
a	
diagnosis	
of

have	
been	
associated	
with

Moebius

A	
number	
of	
genetic

have	
been	
reported	
to

(	
e.g.

)	
.	

In	
these	
cases	
,	
hypersomnia	
due	
to	
a	
medical

should	
be	
diagnosed	
only	
if	
the	
excessive

is	
still

Residual	
hypersomnia	
in

OSA	
:	
Some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
SRBDs	
report	
persistent

despite	
apparently	
adequate	
amounts	
of	
sleep	
and	
optimal	
treatment

They	
may

but	
most	
have	
mean

They	
also	
report	
more	
fatigue

It	
is	
essential	
that	
sleep

be	
fully	
treated	
for	
at

three	
months

The

in	
establishing	
a

is	
deter-	
mining	
whether	
the

disorder	
is	
truly	
causing	
the	
hypersomnolence	
.

Features	
Patients	ORGANISM
with	
this

have	
excessive	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
or

Clinical	
and	
Pathological	
Subtypes	
Hypersomnia	
due	
to	
sedating	
medications	
:	
Sedation	
is	
a	
common	
side	
effect	
of	
many	
prescription	
medications	
including	
benzodiazepines	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
nonbenzodiazepine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
hypnot-	
ics	
,	
opioids	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
barbiturates	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
anticonvulsants	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
antipsychotics	
,	
anticholinergics	
,	
and	
some	
antidepressants	
and	
antihistamines	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

Sleepiness	
also	
can	
occur	
with	
some	
dopamine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
agonists	
such	
as	
pramipexole	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
or	
ropinirole	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
and	
with	
many	
antiseizure	
medications	
.	

Though	
less	
common	
,	
sleepiness	
can	
also	
occur	
with	
nonsteroidal	
anti	
-	
inflammatory	
drugs	
,	
some	
antibiotics	
,	
antispasmodics	
,	
antiarryhthmics	
,	
and	
beta	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
blockers	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

Over	
-	
the-	
counter	
medications	
,	
such	
as	
valerian	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
can	
produce	
sedation	
.	

Excessive	
sleepiness	
is	
especially	
common	
when	
these	
drugs	
are	
used	
in	
elderly	
patients	ORGANISM
or	
those	
with	
multiple	
medical	
conditions	
,	
or	
in	
combination	
.	

Some	
tolerance	
to	
the	
sedative	
effects	
can	
occur	
with	
time	
.	

Hypersomnia	
due	
to	
substance	
abuse	
:	
Daytime	
sleepiness	
can	
occur	
with	
abuse	
of	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
benzodiazepines	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
barbiturates	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
gamma	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
hydroxybutyrate	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
opiates	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
and	
marijuana	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

Hypersomnia	
due	
to	
stimulant	
withdrawal	
:	
Daytime	
sleepiness	
is	
common	
with	
abrupt	
discontinuation	
of	
stimulants	
.	

In	
chronically	
heavy	
amphetamine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
users	
,	
sleepiness	
is	
most	
severe	
in	
the	
first	
week	
of	
withdrawal	
and	
can	
persist	
for	
up	
to	
three	
weeks	
;	
indi-	
viduals	
may	
have	
an	
increase	
in	
total	
sleep	
and	
daytime	
napping	
,	
but	
sleep	
may	
seem	
fragmented	
and	
nonrestorative	
.	

Significant	
depression	
often	
accompanies	
the	
hyper-	
somnolence	
.	

Infrequently	
,	
sleepiness	
may	
be	
a	
residual	
complaint	
in	
those	
who	
have	
used	
stimulants	
in	
the	
past	
but	
have	
been	
abstinent

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnography	
is	
generally	
unnecessary	
unless	
a

is	
sus-	
pected

Polysomnography	
and

vary	
depending	
on	
the	
specific	
substance	
in	
question	
and	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
most	
recent	
intake	
.	

With	
stimulant	
withdrawal	
,	
noc-

polysomnography	
may	
show	
normal

Although	
many	
psychotropic

may	
result	
in

,	
it	
is	
import-	CELLULAR_COMPONENT

for

to	
recognize	
that	
many	
psychiatric

A.	ORGANISM

The	
patient	ORGANISM
has	
daily	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
to	
sleep	
or	
daytime	
lapses	
into	
sleep	
occurring	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
.	

B.	
The	
daytime	
sleepiness	
occurs	
in	
association	
with	
a	
concurrent	
psychiatric	
disorder	
.	

C.	ORGANISM

The	
symptoms	
are	
not	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
untreated	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
a	
medical	
or	
neurological	
disorder	
,	
or	
the	
effects	
of	
medications	
or	
drugs	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Patients	ORGANISM
with	
hypersomnia	
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	
disorder	
may	
report	
excessive	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
or	
excessive	
napping	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
they	
often	
feel	
their	
sleep	
is	
of	
poor	
quality	
and	
nonrestorative	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
are	
often	
intensely	
focused	
on	
their	
hypersomnolence	
,	
and	
psychiatric	
symptoms	
may	
become	
apparent	
only	
after	
prolonged	
interviews	
or	
psychometric	
testing	
.	

Associated	
psychiatric	
conditions	
include	
mood	
disorders	
,	
conversion	
or	
undifferentiated	
somatoform	
disorder	
,	
and	
less	
frequently	
other	
mental	
disorders	
such	
as	
schizoaffective

,	
or	
personality

Associated	
Features	
Poor	
work

,	
or	
abruptly

Hypersomnia	
associated	
with	
a	
conversion

or	
somatic	
symptom	
disorder	
:	
Pseudohypersomnia	
or	
pseudonarcolepsy	
,	
sometimes	
with	
pseudocataplexy	
,	
has	
been	
described	
.	

Demographics	
Hypersomnia	
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	
disorder	
accounts	
for	
5	
%	
to	
7	
%	
of	
hyper-	
somnolence	
cases	
.	

Women	ORGANISM
are	
more	
susceptible	
than	
men	ORGANISM
,	
and	
the	
typical	
age	
range	
is	
between	
20	
and	
50	
years	
.	

In	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
major	
depression	
,	
the	
prevalence	
of	
hypersom-	
nolence	
ranges	
from	
5	
%	
to	
over	
50	
%	
depending	
on	
how	
hypersomnolence	
is	
defined	
.	

Hypersomnolence	
affects	
over	
50	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
seasonal	
affective	
disorder	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Not	
applicable	
or	
known	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Not	
known	
,	
except	
for	
the	
familial	
patterns	
of	
certain	
psychiatric	
disorders	
(	
e.g.	
,	
bipolar	
II	
disorder	
)	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
is	
usually	
in	
the	
third	
decade	
in	
both	
sexes	
.	

With	
major	
depres-	
sion	
,	
hypersomnolence	
may	
persist	
even	
after	
the	
depressive	
episode	
improves	
,	
and	
persistent	
hypersomnolence	
is	
associated	
with	
increased	
risk	
of	
recurrent	
depression	
.	

Complications	
are	
mostly	
social	
and	
occupational	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Hypersomnolence	
occurs	
in	
10	
%	
to	
20	
%	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
major	
depression	
,	
some-	
times	
in	
combination	
with	
insomnia	
,	
but	
sleep	
quality	
appears	
normal	
.	

Although	
sleep	
problems	
may	
develop	
at	
any	
stage	
of	
depression	
,	
they	
are	
most	
pronounced	
during	
the	
acute	
phase	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
and	
adolescents	
with	
depression	
who	
manifest	
either	
insomnia	
or	
hypersomnolence	
generally	
manifest	
more	
pronounced	
symptoms	
,	
such	
as	
anhedo-	
nia	
and	
weight	
loss	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
underlying	
cause	
is	
unknown	
.	

Although	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
this	
disorder	
report	
sleep-	
iness	
,	
sleep	
studies	
reveal	
little	
or	
no	
evidence	
of	
increased	
propensity	
to	
sleep	
.	

In	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
fragmented	
nighttime	
sleep	
may	
contribute	
to	
their	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

Because	
of	
uncertainty	
about	
the	
nature	
of	
the	
relationship	
,	
the	
term	
“	
hypersomnia	
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	
disorder	
”	
is	
preferred	
to	
“	
hypersomnia	
due	
to	
a	
psychi-	
atric	
disorder	
.	
”	

Objective	
Findings	
Nocturnal	
polysomnography	
typically	
shows	
a	
prolonged	
total	
time	
in	
bed	
with	
frag-	
mented	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
latency	
is	
prolonged	
,	
wake	
time	
after	
sleep	
onset	
is	
increased	
,	
awakenings	
may	
be	
frequent	
and	
prolonged	
,	
and	
sleep	
efficiency	
is	
low	
.	

REM	
sleep	
latency	
may	
be	
shortened	
in	
the	
case	
of	
untreated	
depression	
.	

Sleep	
latencies	
on	
the	
MSLT	
are	
often	
within	
normal	
limits	
,	
a	
result	
contrasting	
with	
the	
subjective	
complaint	
of	
daytime	
sleepiness	
and	
an	
elevated	
score	
on	
the	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
.	

24	
-	
hour	
continuous	
sleep	
-	
recording	
studies	
typically	
show	
considerable	
time	
spent

night	
,	
a	
behavior	
sometime	
referred	
to	
as

.	

Psychiatric	
inter-	
views	
and	
evaluations	
are	
essential	
to	
diagnose	
the	
underlying	
psychiatric	
condition	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
As	
there	
are	
no	
definitive	
tests	
for	
diagnosing	
hypersomnolence	
associated	
with	
a	
psy-	
chiatric	
disorder	
,	
it	
is	
essential	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
common	
causes	
of	
sleepiness	
such	
as	
insufficient	
sleep	
,	
sedation	
from	
medications	
or	
substances	
,	
SRBD	
,	
periodic	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movement	
disorder	
,	
and	
IH	
.	

Chronic	
fatigue	
syndrome	
is	
characterized	
by	
persistent	
or	
relapsing	
fatigue	
that	
does	
not	
resolve	
with	
sleep	
or	
rest	
,	
but	
the	
main	
complaint	
is	
usually	
fatigue	
rather	
than	
sleepiness	
.	

Insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
is	
associated	
with	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
impaired	
concentration	
,	
and	
lowered	
energy	
level	
,	
but	
a	
detailed	
history	
of	
the	
subject	
’s	
current	
sleep	
schedule	
reveals	
chronic	
sleep	
deprivation	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Future	
Directions	

The	
lack	
of	
concordance	
between	
subjective	
and	
objective	
findings	
raises	
multiple	
issues	
.	

It	
is	
unclear	
to	
what	
extent	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
are	
objectively	
sleepy	
or	
,	
instead	
,	
suffer	
from	
decreased	
energy	
and	
lack	
of	
interest	
that	
confines	
them	
to	
bed	
.	

More	
research	
is	
needed	
to	
create	
an	
effective	
definition	
of	
hypersomnolence	
in	
this	
population	
and	
to	
develop	
tools	
for	
measuring	
it	
.	

Finally	
,	
future	
efforts	
should	
define	
the	
mechanism	
through	
which	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
express	
their	
psychiatric	
symptoms	
as	
excessive	
sleepiness	
.

A.	ORGANISM

The	
patient	ORGANISM
has	
daily	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
to	
sleep	
or	
daytime	
lapses	
into	
sleep	
or	
,	
in	
the	
case	
of	
prepubertal	
children	ORGANISM
,	
there	
is	
a	
complaint	
of	
behavioral	
abnormalities	
attributable	
to	
sleepiness	
.	

B.	
The	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
sleep	
time	
,	
established	
by	
personal	
or	
collateral	
history	
,	
sleep	
logs	
,	
or	
actigraphy1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
usually	
shorter	
than	
expected	
for	
age.2	
C.	

The	
curtailed	
sleep	
pattern	
is	
present	
most	
days	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
.	

D.	

The	
patient	ORGANISM
curtails	
sleep	
time	
by	
such	
measures	
as	
an	
alarm	
clock	
or	
being	
awakened	
by	
another	
person	
and	
generally	
sleeps	
longer	
when	
such	
measures	
are	
not	
used	
,	
such	
as	
on	
weekends	
or	
vacations	
.	

E.	ORGANISM
Extension	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
results	
in	
resolution	
of	
the

.	

F.	ORGANISM

The	
symptoms	
are	
not	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
untreated	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
the	
effects	
of	
medications	
or	
drugs	
,	
or	
other	
medical	
,

,	
or	
mental

Notes	
.	

If	
there	
is	
doubt	
about	
the	
accuracy	
of	
personal	
history	
or	
sleep	
logs	
,	
then	
actigraphy	
should	
be	
performed	
,	
preferably	
for	
at	
least	
two	
weeks	
.	
.	

In	
the	
case	
of	
long	
sleepers	
,	
reported	
habitual	
sleep	
periods	
may	
be	
normal	
based	
on	
age	
.	

However	
,	
these	
sleep	
periods	
may	
be	
insufficient	
for	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

Essential	
Features	
Insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
occurs	
when	
an	
individual	
persistently	
fails	
to	
obtain	
the	
amount	
of	
sleep	
required	
to	
maintain	
normal	
levels	
of	
alertness	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

The	
individual	
is	
chronically	
sleep	
deprived	
as	
a	
result	
of	
failure	
to	
achieve	
necessary	
sleep	
time	
due	
to	
reduced	
time	
in	
bed	
.	

There	
is	
a	
U	
-	
shaped	
relationship	
between	
age	
and	
average	
sleep	
time	
,	
with	
the	
minimum	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
individuals	
.	

Examination	
reveals	
unimpaired	
or	
above	
-	
average	
ability	
to	
initiate	
and	
maintain	
sleep	
,	
with	
little	
or	
no	
psychopathology	
.	

Physical	
examination	
reveals	
no	
medical	
explanation	
for	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
sleepiness	
.	

A	
detailed	
history	
of	
the	
sleep	
pattern	
reveals	
a	
substantial	
dis-	
parity	
between	
the	
need	
for	
sleep	
and	
the	
amount	
actually	
obtained	
.	

The	
significance	
of	
this	
disparity	
often	
goes	
unappreciated	
by	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
.	

Sleep	
time	
that	
is	
markedly	
extended	
on	
weekend	
nights	
or	
during	
holidays	
compared	
to	
weekday	
nights	
is	
also	
suggestive	
of	
this	
disorder	
.	

A	
therapeutic	
trial	
of	
a	
longer	
major	
sleep	
episode	
can	
reverse	
the	
symptoms	
.	

In	
individuals	
with	
physiologic	
sleep	
requirements	
significantly	
in	
excess	
of	
seven	
to	
eight	
hours	
,	
reported	
“	
average	
”	
amounts	
of	
sleep	
(	
e.g.	
,	
seven	
hours	
/	
night	
)	
may	
,	
in	
fact	
,	
be	
insufficient	
.	

Additional	
symptoms	
such	
as	
sleep	
paralysis	
and	
hypnagogic	
hallucinations	
may	
occur	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Depending	
upon	
chronicity	
and	
extent	
of	
sleep	
loss	
,	
individuals	
with	
this	
condition	
may	
show	
irritability	
,

,	
fatigue	
,	
restlessness	
,	
uncoordination	
,	
and	
malaise	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

Secondary	
symptoms	
may	
become	
the	
main	
focus	
of	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
,	
serving	
to	
obscure	
the	
primary	
cause	
of	
the	
difficulties	
.	

Psychologically	
and	
somatically	
normal	
individuals	ORGANISM
who	
chronically	
obtain	
less	
sleep	
than	
they	
physiologically	
require

cally	
experience	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

Situational	
factors	
such	
as	
demands	
of	
the	
family	
and	
work	
schedule	
may	
,	
on	
occasion	
,	
make	
it

Demographics	
Insufficient

affects

It	
may	
be	
more	
frequent	
in	
adolescence	
,	
when	
sleep	
need	
is	
high	
,	
but	
social	
pressure	
and	
tendency	
to	
delay	
sleep	
often	
lead	
to	
chronic	
restricted	
sleep	
.	

Cultural	
factors	
may	
also	
influence	
sleep	
dura-	
tion	
,	
with	
students	
from	
different	
countries	
reporting

varying	
between	
six

Developmental	
Issues	
Insufficient

is	
a	
common	
problem	
in

.	

It	
should	
be	
differ-	
entiated	
from

,	
the	
effects	
of

Increased

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Symptoms	
are	
due	
to	
normal	
physiological	
and	
psychological	
responses	
to	
sleep	
depri-	
vation	
.	

Sleep	
restriction	
studies	
in	
normal	
volunteers	
have	
shown	
that	
even	
mild	
sleep	
restriction	
(	
for	
example	
,	
six	
hours	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
per	
night	
)	
results	
in	
a	
correspond-	CELL
ing	
decrease	
in	
performance	
and	
increased	
sleepiness	
.	

Sleep	
restriction	
to	
four	
hours	
per	
night	
(	
i.e.	
,	
extension	
of	
wakefulness	
to	
20	
hours	
per	
day	
)	
will	
likely	
lead	
to	
greater	
buildup	
of	
homeostatic	
sleep	
drive	
during	
the	
waking	
hours	
and	
greater	
likelihood	
of	
impaired	
performance	
on	
a	
psychomotor	
vigilance	
task	
.	

The	
effects	
of	
sleep	
depriva-	
tion	
on	
neurobehavioral	
performance	
measures	
may	
vary	
with	
the	
nature	
of	
the	
task	
being	
considered	
.	

In	
some	
long	
sleepers	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
be	
aware	
that	
extending	
sleep	
to	
nine	
or	
more	
hours	
often	
results	
in	
improved	
performance	
.	

The	
diagnosis	
of	
insufficient	
sleep	
syn-	
drome	
may	
be	
especially	
difficult	
to	
make	
in	
subjects	
who	
have	
a	
physiologic	
need	
for	
unusually	
large	
amounts	
of	
sleep	
.

Actigraphy	
combined	
with	
sleep	
diaries

for	
a	
2-

,	
and

Polysomnography

MSLT	
are	
not	
required	
to	
establish	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
.	

Rather	
,	
sleep	
time	
is	
extended	
first	
,	
and	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
is	
reevaluated	
.	

If	
a	
therapeutic	
trial	
with	
a	
longer	
sleep	
episode	
eliminates	
the	
symptoms	
,	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
is	
diagnosed

and	
high

Long	
Sleeper	

A	
long	
sleeper	
is	
an	
individual	
who	
consistently	
sleeps	
substantially	
more	
in	
24	
hours	
than	
does	
the	
typical	
person	
of	
his	
or	
her	
age	
group	
.	

For	
adults	
,	
the	
usually	
accepted	
figure	
is	
10	
hours	
or	
more	
,	
but	
many	
epidemiologic	
studies	
have	
used	
sleep	
times	
of	
8–10	
hours	
.	

For	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adolescents	
,	
the	
entity	
should	
be	
considered	
if	
sleep	
time	
is	
more	
than	
two	
hours	
longer	
than	
age	
-	
specific	
norms	
.	

Sleep	
,	
although	
long	
,	
is	
basi-	TISSUE
cally	
normal	
in	
architecture	
and	
physiology	
.	

Sleep	
efficiency	
and	
timing	
are	
normal	
.	

A	
consistent	
daily	
pattern	
,	
documented	
by	
a	
carefully	
kept	
sleep	
log	
(	
preferably	
con-	
firmed	
by	
actigraphy	
)	
,	
showing	
10	
or	
more	
hours	
of	
sleep	
per	
night	
over	
a	
minimum	
of	
seven	
days	
is	
desirable	
for	
the	
identification	
of	
the	
long	
sleeper	
.	

In	
general	
,	
long	
sleepers	
seek	
medical	
help	
when	
they	
develop	
sleepiness	
as	
a	
result	
of	
being	
forced	
to	
curtail	
their	
sleep	
time	
to	
less	
than	
their	
required	
amounts	
.	

Usually	
,	
the	
long	
sleep	
pattern	
began	
in	
childhood	
,	
is	
well	
established	
by	
early	
adolescence	
,	
and	
persists	
throughout	
life	
.	

Many	
long	
sleepers	
,	
because	
of	
occupational	
or	
educational	
demands	
,	
function	
with	
reasonable	
success	
on	
nine	
hours	
of	
sleep	
per	
night	
during	
the	
work	
or	
school	
week	
,	
with	
increases	
to	
12	
or	
more	
hours	
on	
weekends	
and	
holidays	
.	

About	
2	
%	
of

and	
1.5	
%	
of

report

,	
but	
it	
is	
not	
clear	
whether	
most	
of	
the	
subjects	ORGANISM
were	
naturally	
long	
sleep-	
ers	
or	
had	
disorders	
resulting	
in	
excessive	
duration	
of	
sleep	
.	

In	
subjects	
older	
than	
60	
years	
,	
sleep	
duration	
longer	
than	
9.5	
hours	
is	
associated	
with	
male	
sex	
,	
low	
education	
,	
no	
physical	
exercise	
,	
and	
more	
physical	
diseases	
.	

Long	
(	
>	
nine	
hours	
)	
sleep	
duration	
has	
a	
high	
heritability	
(	
44	
%	
)	
and	
concordance	
between	
monozygotic	
twins	
,	
which	
is	
higher	
if	
they	
live	
together	
.	

Genomewide	
studies	
favor	
a	
polygenic	
origin	
of	
sleep	
duration	
,	
with	
influence	
of	
clock	
and	
other	
genes	
(

.	

Long	
sleepers	
presumably	
represent	
the	
extreme	
high	
end	
of	
the	
normal	
sleep	
duration	
continuum	
.	

Long	
sleepers	
,	
like	
short	
sleepers	
,	
have	
normal	
absolute	
amounts	
of	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
,	
unless	
there	
is	
chronic	
sleep	
restriction	
preceding	
polysomnography	
,	
in	
which	
case	
the	
absolute	
amount	
of	
N3	
stage	
is	
increased	
.	

Amounts	
of	
stages	
N2	CELL
and	
REM	
sleep	
are	
somewhat	
higher	
than	
normal	
.	

The	
individual	
has	
no	
problem	
with	
time	
distortion	
or	
ability	
to	
be	
accurate	
about	
the	
quantity	
or	
quality	
of	
sleep

Assuming	
that	
individuals	
Central

Central	
Disorders

Hypersomnolence	
have	
obtained	
their	
usual	
sleep	
amounts	
for	
several	
nights	
before	
the	
procedure	
,	
no	
sleepiness	
is	
evident	
on	
the	
MSLT	
.	

It	
is	
important	
to	
differentiate	
the	
long	
sleeper	
from	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
,	
idiopathic	
hypersomnia	
,	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
,	
or	
medical	
causes	
of	
hypersomnolence	
.	

Many	
pathologic	
causes	
of	
increased	
sleep	
have	
an	
acute	
or	
subacute	
onset	
,	
may	
not	
be	
present	
since	
childhood	
,	
and	
rarely	
show	
the	
stable	
course	
of	
the	
long	
sleeper	
.	

Nevertheless	
,	
differentiation	
from	
pathologic	
con-	
ditions	
of	
hypersomnolence	
may	
be	
difficult	
in	
the	
child	
or	
adolescent	
because	
the	
normal	
continuum	
of	
sleep	
duration	
is	
somewhat	
higher	
in	
these	
age	
groups	
than	
in	
adults	
.	

The	
correct	
determination	
is	
often	
made	
by	
exclusion	
of	
specific	
diagnostic	
features	
associated	
with	
other	
conditions	
and	
by	
the	
absence	
of	
complaints	
concerning	
the	
quality	
of	
the	
individual	
’s	
awake	
-	
state	
functioning	
when	
adequate	
sleep	
is	
obtained	
(	
e.g.	
,	
during	
prolonged	
holidays	
)	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
the	
differentiation	
of	
a	
genuine	
long	
sleeper	
from	
a	
patient	ORGANISM
with	
idiopathic	
hypersomnia	
may	
be	
difficult	
.	

In	
the	
genuine	
long	
sleeper	
,	
sleeping	
long	
hours	
is	
refreshing	
,	
and	
sleepiness	
disappears	
when	
long	
hours	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
are	
enforced

Circadian	
rhythms	
are	
endogenous	
,	
near-24	
-	
hour	
biological	
rhythms	
that	
exist	
in	
all	
living	
organisms	
.	

The	
internal	
near-24	
-	
hour	
circadian	
clock	
is	
entrained	
or	
synchro-	
nized	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
light	
-	
dark	
cycle	
.	

In	
humans	ORGANISM
,	
the	
endogenous	
period	
of	
the	
circa-	
dian	
oscillation	
is	
genetically	
determined	
and	
typically	
is	
slightly	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

In	
order	
to	
maintain	
entrainment	
,	
the	
endogenous	
rhythm	
must	
be	
reset	
each	
day	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
clock	
time	
.	

For	
optimal	
sleep	
,	
the	
actual	
sleep	
time	
should	
match	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
circadian	
rhythm	
of	
sleep	
and	
wake	
propensity	
.	

Therefore	
,	
a	
recurrent	
or	
chronic	
pattern	
of	
sleep	
and	
wake	
disturbance	
may	
result	
from	
disruption	
of	
the	
internal	
circa-	
dian	
timing	
system	
or	
a	
misalignment	
between	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
individual	
’s	
circadian	
sleep	
-	
wake	
propensity	
and	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
social	
and	
physical	
environments	
(	
e.g.	
,	
sleep	
episodes	
scheduled	
entirely	
or	
in	
part	
during	
a	
phase	
of	
circadian	
alertness	
promotion	
)	
.	

As	
used	
herein	
,	
a	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep	
-	
wake	
disorder	
(	
CRSWD	
)	
is	
defined	
by	
the	
following	
criterion	
:	
The	
disorder	
is	
caused	
by	
alterations	
of	
the	
circadian	
time	
-	
keeping	
system	
,	
its	
entrainment	
mechanisms	
,	
or	
a	
misalignment	
of	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
and	
the	
external	
environment	
.	

Most	
CRSWDs	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
arise	
when	
a	
substantial	
misalignment	
exists	
between	
the	
internal	
rhythm	
and	
the	
required	
timing	
of	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
school	
,	
work	
,	
or	
social	
activities	
.	

Therefore	
,	
measurement	
of	
endogenous	
circadian	
timing	
is	
important	
for	
the	
accu-	
rate	
diagnosis	
of	
CRSWDs	CANCER
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
history	
,	
multiple	
tools	
are	
available	
to	
assess	
sleep	
-	
wake	
patterns	
.	

Sleep	
log	
and	
actigraphy	
are	
essential	
instruments	
in	
the	
evaluation	
of	
CRSWDs	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
and	
should	
be	
conducted	
for	
at	
least	
seven	
days	
,	
preferably	
for	
14	
days	
,	
to	
capture	
work	
and	
non

days

The	
most

are	
difficulty	
initiating

Delayed	
sleep

wake	
phase	
disorder	
(	
DSWPD	
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
habitual	
sleep-	
wake	
timing	
that	
is	
delayed	
,	
usually	
more	
than	
two	
hours	
,	
relative	
to	
conventional	
or	
socially	
acceptable	
timing	
.	

Affected	
individuals	
complain	
of	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
a	
socially	
acceptable	
time	
,	
as	
required	
to	
obtain	
sufficient	
sleep	
duration	
on	
a	
school	
or	
work	
night	
.	

Once	
sleep	
onset	
occurs	
,	
it	
is	
reportedly	
of	
normal	
duration	
.	

These	
individ-	
uals	
also	
experience	
difficulty	
arising	
at	
a	
socially	
acceptable	
wake	
time	
,	
as	
required	
to	
prepare	
for	
school	
or	
work	
.	

When	
allowed	
to	
follow	
his	
or	
her	
preferred	
schedule	
,	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
timing	
of	
sleep	
is	
delayed	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Individuals	
with	
DSWPD	ORGANISM
may	
demonstrate	
excessive	
sleep	
inertia	
(	
extreme	
difficulty	
awakening	
and	
confusion	
)	
in	
the	
morning	
as	
a	
result	
of	
curtailed	
sleep	
time	
and	
awak-	
ening	TISSUE
during	
a	
circadian	
phase	
of	
high	
sleep	
propensity	
.	

Individuals	
with	
this	
disor-	
der	
as	
well	
as	
normal	
sleepers	
with	
evening	
chronotypes	
may	
have	
increased	
rates	
of

.	

In	
some	
individuals	
with	
DSWPD	
,	
there	
may	
be	
an	
overlap	
with	
non-24

disorder	
,	
or	
an	
alternation	
between	
symptoms	
of	
the	
two	
disorders	
.	

Attempts	
to	
cope	
with	
the	
inability	
to	
fall	
asleep	
earlier	
may	
result	
in	
the	
development	
of	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Individuals	
may	
use	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
sedatives	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
hypnotics	
,	
or	
stimulant	
substances	
to	
alleviate	
symptoms	
of

and	
excessive

,	
thereby	
perpetuating	
their	
underlying	
sleep	
disorder	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Motivated	
delayed	
sleep

wake	
phase	
disorder	
is	
a	
subtype	
typically	
composed	
of	
ado-	
lescents	
who	
have	
little	
intrinsic	
motivation	
to	
successfully	
complete	
treatment	
and	
thereby	
resume	
a	
normal	
lifestyle	
(	
regular	
school	
attendance	
,	
developmentally	
appro-	
priate	
peer	
interactions	
,	
etc	
)	
.	

A	
history	
of	
mood	
or	
anxiety	
disorder	
(	
especially	
school	
phobia	
and	
separation	
and	
social	
anxiety	
)	
or	
other	
factors	
(	
e.g.	
,	
learning	
disabilities	
,	
attention	
deficit	
hyperactivity	
disorder	
)	
are	
often	
present	
and	
may	
motivate	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
(	
sometimes	
unconsciously	
)	
to	
avoid	
a	
return	
to	
normal	
adolescent	
activities	
,

.	

It	
is	
not	
uncommon	
that	
ill

medical	
issues	
(	
e.g.	
,	
chronic	
fatigue	
,	
recurrent	
mononucleosis	
episodes	
,	
pain	
syndromes	
)	
trigger	
the	
onset	
or	
complicate	
the	
course	
of	
the	
disorder	
.	

Important	
clues	
,	
in	
addition	
to	
the	
exis-	
tence	
of	
premorbid	
mental	
disorders	
,	
include	
exaggerated	
presenting	
symptoms	
(	
e.g.	
,	
“	
ca	
n’t	
wake	
up	
even	
if	
I	
throw

”	
)	
and	
failure	
to	
comply	
with	
basic	
straightforward	
treatment	
recommendations	
(	
e.g.	
,	
refusal	
or	
inability	
to	
stop

day	
)	
.	

Although	
social	
,	
psychological	
,	
and	
environmental	
factors	
may	
play	
a	
significant	
role	
in	
the	
development	
of

International

only	
a

the	
recognition	
that	
most

.	

Demographics	
The	
exact	
prevalence	
of	
DSWPD	
in	
the	
general	
population	
is	
unknown	
.	

The	
condition	
is	
more	
common	
among	
adolescents	
and	
young	
adults	
,	
with	
a	
reported	
prevalence	
of	
7	
%	
to	
16	
%	
.	

It	
is	
estimated	
that	
DSWPD	
is	
seen	
in	
approximately	
10	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
pre-	
senting	
in

with	
recurrent	
insomnia	
complaints	
.	

There	
have	
been	
no	
studies	
assessing	
racial	
/	
ethnic	
differences	
in	
DSWPD	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Most	
individuals	
with	
DSWPD	
are	
evening

.	

Genetic	
factors	
such	
as	
polymorphism	
in	
the	
circadian	
clock	
gene	
hPer3	
are	
associated	
with	
DSWPD	
.	

Environmental	
factors	
,	
including	
decreased

light	
during	
the	
phase

of	
the

)	
(	
i.e.

)	
or	
increased	
exposure	
to	
bright	
light	
during	
the	
phase	
delay	
portion	
of	
the	
PRC	
(	
i.e.	
,	
late	
in	
the	
evening	
)	
may	
exacerbate	
the	
delayed	
circa-	
dian	
phase	
.	

Individuals	
may	
have	
increased

or	
decreased

in	
the

changes	
in	
work	
and	
social	
schedules	
,	
travel	
across	
time	
zones	
,	
and	
shift	
work	
can	
precipitate	
this	
disorder	
.	

Individuals	
may	
consume	
excessive	
caffeine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
other	
stimulants	
,	
which	
may	
further	
delay	
sleep	
onset	
and	
thus	
exacerbate	
the	
delayed	
sleep	
time	
.	

Social	
and

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
A	
delayed	
sleep	
pattern	
typically	
begins	
during	
adolescence	
.	

Onset	
in	
early	
childhood	
is	
also	
described	
,	
especially	
in	
familial	
cases	
;	
the	
onset	
may	
follow	
psychological	
,	
medical	
,	
or	
environmental	
stressors	
.	

Without	
treatment	
,	
DSWPD	
is	
a	
chronic	
condition	
that	
may	
last	
into	
late	
life	
.	

However	
,	
with	
increasing	
age	
across	
adulthood	
,	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
may	
advance	
,	
thereby	
decreasing	
the	
propensity	
to	
delayed	
sleep	
phase	
.	

Phototherapy

as	
well	
as	
behavioral	
and	
pharmacologic	
treatments	
,	
can	
advance	
the	
timing	
of	
sleep

but	
there	
is	
usually	
a	
continual	
tendency	
and	
prefer-	
ence	
for	
delayed

Developmental	
Issues	
DSWPD	
may	
be	
encountered	
in	
any	
age	
group	
but	
is	
especially	
prevalent	
among	
ado-	
lescents	
and	
young	
adults	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
clinical	
features	
described	
elsewhere	
,	
DSWPD	ORGANISM
may	
present	
in	
older	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adolescents	
with	
chief	
complaints	
of	
truancy	CANCER
,	
repeated	
school	
absences	
,	
chronic	
tardiness	
and/or	
school	
failure	
,	
rather	
than	
sleep	
complaints	
per	
se	
.	

In	
severe	
cases	
,	
school	
attendance	
is	
completely	
curtailed	
and	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
may	
have	
failed	
to	
attend	
school	
regularly	
for	
many	
months	
.	

Extreme	
diffi-	
culty	
in	
morning	
awakening	
,	
requiring	
intensive	
parental	
involvement	
,	
may	
also	
be	
the	
presenting	
concern	
.	

An	
increased	
risk	
of	
motor	
vehicle	
accidents	
has	
been	
associated	
with	
delayed	
sleep	
onset	
and	
resultant	
insufficient	
sleep	
in	
adolescents	
;	
thus	
,	
the	
occur-	ORGAN
rence	
of	
a	
car	
crash	
or	
“	
near	
-	
miss	
”	
incident	
should	
alert	
the	
clinician	
to	
probe	
for	
addi-	
tional	
evidence	
of	
circadian	
pathology	
.	

Adolescents	
may	
also	
present	
primarily	
with	
mood	
complaints	
(	
depression	
,	
suicidal	
ideation	
)	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	
is	
commonly	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
and	
may	
be	
the	
chief	
presenting	
complaint	
in	
adolescents	
with	
DSWPD	
as	
a	
result	
of	
repeated	
attempts	
and	
failures	
to	
achieve	
sleep	
onset	
at	
their	
desired	
bedtime	
.	

In	
younger	
children	ORGANISM
,	
the	
condition	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
delays	
in	
other	
markers	
of	
circadian	
phase	
,	
including	
the	
typical	
presleep	
surge	
in	
alertness	
referred	
to	
as	
the	
“	AMINO_ACID
for-	
bidden	
zone	
”	
or	
“	
second	
wind	
phenomenon	
.	
”	

Thus	
,	
especially	
in	
younger	
children	ORGANISM
,	
DSWPD	ORGANISM
may	
present	
primarily	
as	
bedtime	
resistance	
,	
as	
caregivers	
attempt	
to	
establish	
bedtimes	
that	
directly	
conflict	
with	
the	
child	
’s	
circadian	
-	
mediated	
readiness	
for	
sleep	
.	

Several	
pediatric	
populations	
appear	
to	
have	
an	
increased	
vulnerability	
to	
DSWPD	
and	
sleep	
disturbances	
,	
likely	
of	
multifactorial	
etiology	
.	

These	
include	
children	ORGANISM
with	
attention	
deficit	
hyperactivity	
disorder	
(	
ADHD	CANCER
)	
and	
autism	
spectrum	
disorder	
(	
ASD	
)	
.	

Several	
studies	
have	
examined	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
onset	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
ADHD	CANCER
and	
reported	
significant	
delays	
in	
comparison	
with	
typically	
developing	
children	ORGANISM
,	
as	
well	
as	
suc-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
cessful	
treatment	
with	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

Children	ORGANISM
with	
ASD	
have	
a	
high	
prevalence	
(	
up	
to	
80	
%	
)	
of	
sleep	
disturbances	
,	
including	
delayed	
sleep	
onset	
,	
night	
and	
early	
morning	
awakenings	
,	
and	
irregular	
sleep	
patterns	
,	
at	
least	
some	
of	
which	
appear	
associated	
with	
circadian	
abnormalities	
.	

These	
children	ORGANISM
reportedly	
have	
a	
number	
of	
alterations	
in	
mel-	

atonin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
synthesis	
,	
levels	
,	
amplitude	
,	
and	
patterns	
of	
secretion	
.	

Little	
is	
known	
about	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
the	
clinical	
entity	
of	
DSWPD	
in	
the	
pediat-	
ric	
population	
,	
including	
the	
impact	
of	
various	
treatment	
modalities	
,	
the	
likelihood	
of	
spontaneous	
resolution	
of	
symptoms	
,	
or	
long	
-	
term	
consequences	
.	

There	
is	
increasing	
evidence	
to	
suggest	
that	
the	
evening	
chronotype	
is	
associated	
in	
both	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adolescents	
with	
a	
number	
of	
adverse	
consequences	
,	
including	
decreased	
health	
-	
related	
quality	
of	
life	
,	
higher	
rates	
of	
behavioral	
/	
emotional	
problems	
including	
depression	
and	
suicidality	
,	
decreased	
sleep	
duration	
and	
increased	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
more	
sleep	
complaints	
,	
impairments	
in	
academic	
functioning	
,	
and	
increased	
likelihood	
of	
substance	
use	
.	

Thus	
,	
eveningness	
may	
confer	
an	
increased	
risk	
for	
physical	
and	
mental	
health	
problems	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
exact	
mechanisms	
responsible	
for	
DSWPD	
are	
unknown	
.	

An	
abnormal	
interac-	
tion	
between	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
and	
the	
sleep	
homeostatic	
process	
that	
regulates	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
may	
play	
an	
essential	
role	
in	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
DSWPD	
.	

Early	
studies	
reported	
an	
altered	
phase	
relationship	
between	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
and	
circadian	
phase	
,	
whereas	
more	
recent	
studies	
have	
failed	
to	
support	
this	
finding	
.	

In	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
sleep	
onset	
,	
sleep	
offset	
,	
and	
phase	
of	
circadian	
markers	
such	
as	
core	
body	
temperature	
and	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
are	
delayed	
relative	
to	
clock	
time	
when	
com-	ORGAN
pared	
with	
controls	
.	

Although	
this	
condition	
may	
be	
predominantly	
due	
to	
a	
misalign-	
ment	
between	
circadian	
timing	
and	
the	
external	
environment	
,	
alterations	
in	
the	
length	
of	
the	
circadian	
period	
or	
an	
altered	
homeostatic	
process	
(	
indicated	
by	
decreased	
sleep	
propensity	
in	
response	
to	
sleep	
deprivation	
)	
also	
may	
be	
contributing	
factors	
.	

In	
chil-	
dren	
and	
adults	
,	
voluntary	
behaviors	
such	
as	
staying	
awake	
late	
at	
night	
and	
waking	
up	
late	
in	
the	
morning	
or	
afternoon	
may	
result	
in	
an	
abnormal	
relationship	
between	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
and	
the	
sleep	
homeostatic	
process	
that	
regulates	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

Delayed	
bedtimes	
and

,	
thereby	
promoting	
and	
perpetuating	
the

in	
the	
circadian	
sleep

.	

Given	
a	
sufficient	
discrepancy	
between	
early	
and	
late	
wake

Individuals	
may

For	
example	
,	
partial

can	
also	
attenuate	
the

Objective	
Findings	
Recordings	
of	
sleep	
logs	
and	
actigraphy	
over	
an	
interval	
of	
at	
least	
seven	
(	
and	
pref-	
erably	
fourteen	
)	
consecutive	
days	
demonstrate	
delayed	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sleep	
offset	
(	
typically	
greater	
than	
two	
hours	
)	
relative	
to	
socially	
acceptable	
times	
.	

Though	
clock	
times	
may	
be	
culture	
dependent	
,	
for	
many	
affected	
individuals	
sleep	
onset	
is	
typi-	
cally	
delayed	
until	
1:00	
a.m.	
to	
6:00	
a.m.	
,	
(	
though	
may	
be	
earlier	
based	
on	
age	
and	
developmental	
status	
)	
,	
and	
wake	
time	
occurs	
in	
the	
late	
morning	
or	
afternoon	
.	

Daily	
demands	
and	
schedules	
may	
result	
in	
an	
earlier	
than	
desired	
wake	
-	
up	
time	
during	
work	
or	
school	
days	
,	
but	
a	
delay	
in	
bedtime	
and	
wake	
-	
up	
time	
is	
almost	
always	
seen	
during	
free	
days	
and	
vacation	
.	

Polysomnography	
(	
though	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
nor	
required	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
)	
,	
when	
performed	
at	
preferred	
(	
delayed	
)	
sleep	
times	
,	
is	
essentially	
normal	
for	
age	
.	

If	
a	
conventional	
bedtime	
and	
wake	
-	
up	
time	
are	
enforced	
,	
however	
,	
polysomnographic	
recording	
may	
show	
prolonged	
sleep	
latency	
and	
decreased	
total	
sleep	
time	
.	

Laboratory	
measures	
of	
circadian	
timing	
generally	
show	
the	
expected	
phase	
delay	
in	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
nadir	
of	
the	
core

and	
dim-

Several	
questionnaires	
are	
useful	
in	
assessing	
the	
chro-

,	
the	
degree	
of	
eveningness	
or	
morningness	
(	
e.g.	
,	
“

)	
.	

Individuals

DSWPD	
,	
typ-

though	
normal

.	

The	
results	
of	
polysomnography	
and	
other	
diagnostic	
tools	
in	
younger	
age	
groups	
are	
similar	
to	
those	
seen	
in	
adults	
.	

Actigraphy	
and/or	
sleep	
logs	
are	
useful	
in	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
DSWPD	
in	
the	
pediatric	
population	
.	

Several	
validated	
instruments	
are	
available	
for	
assessing	
phase	
preference	
in	
the	
pediatric	
and	
adolescent	
pop-	
ulations	
.	

These	
include	
the	
Children	ORGANISM
’s	
Chronotype

(

)	
(

)	
,	
and	
the	
Morningness

for	
Children	CANCER
and	
Adolescents	
.	

These	
surveys	
have	
been	
used	
to	
assess	
chronotype	
in	
the	
pediatric	
population	
and	
may	
be	
useful	
in	
clinical	
settings	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Delayed	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
“	
normal	
”	
sleep	
pat-	
terns	
,	
particularly	
in	
adolescents	
and	
young	
adults	
who	
maintain	
delayed	
schedules	
regularly	
or	
intermittently	
,	
without	
distress	
or	
impaired	
functioning	
.	

DSWPD	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
difficulty	
initiating	
sleep	
,	
including	
chronic	
insom-	
nia	
disorder	
.	

In	
DSWPD	
,	
sleep	
initiation	
and	
maintenance	
are	
improved	
when	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
is	
allowed	
to	
sleep	
on	
the	
preferred	
schedule	
.	

When	
individuals	
with	
DSWPD	
must	
arise	
before	
the	
desired	
wake	
time	
,	
excessive	
sleep	
inertia	
and	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
may	
be	
evident	
.	

Other	
forms	
of	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
from	
which	
this	
must	
be	
distinguished	
,	
do	
not	
generally	
exhibit	
the	
pronounced	
circadian	
pattern	
and	
do	
not	
abate	
with	
alterations	
in	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedule	
.	

The	
development	
of	
DSWPD	ORGANISM
may	
be	
influenced	
by	
alterations	
in	
circadian	
physiology	
as	
well	
as	
behavioral	
factors	
.	

Inadequate	
sleep	
hygiene	
and	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
must	
also	
be	
considered	
in	
the	
differential	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
is	
limited	
knowledge	
of	
the	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
DSWPD	
.	

Recent	
evidence	
suggests	
that	
alteration	
in	
the	
homeostatic	
regulation	
of	
sleep	
and	
alertness	
may	
play	
an	
important	
role	
.	

The	
intrinsic	
circadian	
period	
may	
be	
abnormally	
long	
.	

Recent	
advances	
in	
the	
understanding	
of	
the	
molecular	
basis	
for	
the	
generation	
and	
entrainment	
of	
circadian	
rhythms	
,	
together	
with	
the	
identification	
of	
a	
familial	
form	
of	
DSWPD	
,	
will	
lead	
to	
improved	
understanding	
of	
the	
mechanisms	
responsible	
for	
this	
condition	
,	
as	
well	
as	
targeted	
,	
evidence

Essential	
Features	
Advanced	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
(	
ASWPD	
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
stable	
advance	
(	
earlier	
timing	
)	
of	
the	
major	
sleep	
episode	
,	
such	
that	
habitual	
sleep	
onset	
and	
offset	
occur	
typically	
two	
or	
more	
hours	
prior	
to	
required	
or	
desired	
times	
.	

Affected	
individ-	
uals	
complain	
of	
early	
morning	
or	
maintenance	
insomnia	
and	
excessive	
evening	
sleep-	
iness	
.	

When	
affected	
individuals	
are	
allowed	
to	
maintain	
an	
advanced	
schedule	
,	
sleep	
quality	
and	
quantity	
are	
improved	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Individuals	
with	
ASWPD	
may	
experience	
chronic	
partial	
sleep	
loss	
due	
to	
early	
morning	
and	
maintenance	
insomnia	
,	
particularly	
if	
sleep	
is	
resisted	
during	
early	
evening	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Familial	
patterns	
are	
discussed	
below	
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
of	
ASWPD	
in	
the	
general	
population	
is	
unknown	
.	

In	
one	
large	
survey	
study	
involving	
middle	
-	
aged	
adults	
(	
40	
-	
64	
years	
)	
,	
the	
population	
prevalence	
was	
esti-	
mated	
at	
1	
%	
,	
although	
it	
is	
unclear	
what	
proportion	
of	
these	
subjects	
would	
deem	
their	
schedule	
to	
be	
significantly	
troublesome	
so	
as	
to	
warrant	
clinical	
attention	
.	

Until	
the	
identification	
of	
familial	
cohorts	
(	
see	
below	
)	
,	
only	
four	
cases	
were	
described	
in

Among

aged	
20	
to	
59	
years	
,	
older

A	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
ability	
to	
sleep	
at	
an	
abnormal	
circadian	
phase	
(	
phase	
tolerance	
)	
also	
impacts	
the	
degree	
to	
which	
adverse	
symptoms	
are	
experienced	
,	
and	
this	
adaptability	
varies	
among	
individuals	
.	

Conflicting	
results	
have	
been	
obtained	
with	
respect	
to	
the	
relationship	
between	
age	
and	
phase

,	
with	
some	
suggesting	
that	
age	
decreases

and	
others	
suggesting	
that

do	
wide

groups	
studied	
.	

Genetic	
factors	
also	
can	
influence	
the	
development	
of	
the	
condition	
,	
as	
has	
been	
definitively	
demonstrated	
among	
select	
familial	
cohorts	
(	
see	
Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
section	
)	
.	

Environmental	
influences	
may	
precipitate	
,	
maintain	
,	
or	
exacerbate	
the	
advanced	
circadian	
phase	
,	
but	
this	
has	
not	
been	
proven	
.	

ASWPD	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
neurodevelopmental	
disorders	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
studies	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
autism	
spectrum	
disorders	
and	
Smith	
-	
Magenis	
syndrome	
have	
shown	
profound	
alterations	
in	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
secretion	
profiles	
,	
which	
may	
manifest	
as	
a	
phase	
advance	
with	
very	
early	
morning	
waking	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Various	
groups	
have	
described	
kindreds	
with	
familial	
ASWPD	
.	

These	
cases	
may	
be	
characterized	
by	
an	
earlier	
age	
of	
onset	
.	

It	
is	
not	
clear	
whether	
the	
familial	
or	
non-	
familial	
variety	
of	
the	
condition	
is	
more	
common	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Repetitive	
attempts	
to	
resume	
sleep	
with	
awakenings	
may	
result	
in	
the	
development	
of	
a	
comorbid	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Individuals	
may	
use	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
other	
sedatives	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
and/or	
stimulants	
to	
alleviate	
symptoms	
,	
potentially	
exacerbating	
the	
underlying	
sleep/	
wake	
disorder	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
neurodevelopmental	
disor-	
ders	
and	
ASWPD	
may	
be	
particularly	
profound	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
ASWPD	
is	
most	
frequently	
encountered	
among	
older	
age	
groups	
.	

An	
early	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
ASWPD	
should	
prompt	
further	
probing	
for	
a	
familial	
pattern	
.	

Caregivers	
may	
report	
that	
a	
child	
wakes	
“	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
morning	
,	
which	
is	
disruptive	
to	
the	
house-	
hold	
routine	
and	
may	
curtail	
parental	
sleep	
.	

This	
is	
particularly	
true	
for	
younger	
chil-	
dren	
,	
who	
may	
require	
adult	
supervision	
once	
they	
are	
awake	
.	

However	
,	
this	
complaint	
regarding	
the	
waking	
pattern	
is	
often	
more	
related	
to	
unrealistic	
caregiver	
expecta-	
tions	
regarding	
an	
“	
appropriate	
”	
wake	
time	
for	
a	
young	
child	
and/or	
a	
developmentally	
inappropriate	
early	
bedtime	
resulting	
in	
prolonged	
time	
in	
bed	
,	
rather	
than	
to	
a	
true	
advance	
in	
sleep	
onset	
and	
offset	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
children	ORGANISM
are	
motivated	
to	
wake	
up	
earlier	
than	
desired	
because	
they	
are	
reinforced	
for	
this	
behavior	
by	
parental	
attention	
or	
the	
opportunity	
to	
watch	
television	
or	
utilize	
other	
media	
upon	
waking	
.	

The	
com-	
plaint	
that	
a	
child	
“	
falls	
asleep	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
evening	
,	
especially	
in	
adolescence	
,	
is	
rare	
and	
should	
raise	
concerns	
regarding	
the	
possibility	
of	
chronically	
insufficient	
sleep	
and/or	
a	
sleep	
disorder	
resulting	
in	
increased	
sleep	
needs	
.	

The	
rarity	
of	
observa-	ORGANISM
tions	
of	
advanced	
sleep	
onset	
and	
offset	
times	
among	
young	
children	ORGANISM
may	
also	
be	
due	
in	
part	
to	
societal	
expectations	
of	
earlier	
bed	
and	
wake	
times	
for	
this	
age	
group	
;	
thus	
,	
a	
misalignment	
with	
circadian	
preference	
is	
less	
likely	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Possible	
etiologies	
include	
:	
(	
1	
)	
an	
alteration	
in	
the	
ability	
of	
the	
circadian	
clock	
to	
phase	
delay	
;	
(	
2	
)	
a	
dominant	
phase	
advance	
region	
of	
the	
light	
phase	
response	
curve	
to	
entraining	
agents	
;	
(	
3	
)	
altered	
strength	
of	
entraining	
agents	
,	
such	
as	
light	
exposure	
at	
the	
appropriate	
circadian	
time	
(	
voluntarily	
or	
involuntarily	
induced	
)	
;	
or	
(	
4	
)	
a	
shortened	
endogenous	
circadian	
period	
of	
the	
pacemaker	
.	

Among	
these	
proposed	
mechanisms	
,	
only	
the	
latter	
has	
been	
definitively	
demonstrated	
among	
select	
familial	
ASWPD	
sub-	
jects	
.	

Genetic	
analyses	
revealed	
a	
missense	
mutation	
in	
a	
casein	
kinase	
(	
CK1ε	
)	
binding	
region	
of	
a	
Period	
gene	
(	
hPer2	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
)	
,	
culminating	
in	
hypophosphorylation	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
by	
CK1ε	
in	
vitro	
.	

Hypophosphorylation	
of	
the	
Period	
protein	
results	
in	
promotion	
of	
its	
transcription	
and	
,	
ultimately	
,	
a	
decrease	
in	
the	
period	
length	
of	
the	
clock	
.	

However	
,	
genetic	
het-	
erogeneity	
is	
apparent	
within	
familial	
ASWPD	
,	
as	
demonstrated	
by	
the	
fact	
that	
other	
cohorts	
from	
this	
same	
study	
and	
another	
study	
did	
not	
reveal	
mutations	
in	
hPer2	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

A	
separate	
report	
of	
a	
Japanese	
familial	
ASWPD	
cohort	
described	
a	
missense	
mutation	
in	
a	
different	
casein	
kinase	
gene	
(	
CKIδ	CANCER
)	
,	
which	
also	
resulted	
in	
decreased	
enzymatic	
activity	
in	
vitro	
.	

Yet	
another	
group	
described	
associations	
between	
hPer1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
and	
hPer2	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
polymorphisms	
and	
extreme	
morningness	
circadian	
preferences	
(	
questionnaire	
-	
based	
)	
,	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
discrete	
ASWPD	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Among	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
familial	
ASWPD	
,	
laboratory	
measures	
to	
determine	
the	
phase	
of	
circadian	
rhythms	
reliably	
show	
the	
expected	
phase	
advance	
in	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
nadir	
of	
the	
temperature	
rhythm	
and	
the	
dim	
light	
melatonin	
onset	
,	
in	
comparison	
with	
unaf-	
fected	
controls	
.	

Among	
those	
with	
nonfamilial	
ASWPD	
,	
a	
wider	
range	
of	
timing	
of	
circadian	
markers	
is	
found	
,	
with	
some	
values	
approaching	
those	
of	
unaffected	
controls	
.	

Polysomnography	
(	
though	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
nor	
required	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
)	
,	
when	
performed	
at	
preferred	
(	
advanced	
)	
sleep	
times	
,	
is	
essentially	
normal	
for	
age	
.	

If	
Circadian	
Rhythm

Disorders	
Circadian	
Rhythm

Disorders	
a	
conventional	
bedtime	
and	
wake	
-	
up	
time	
is	
enforced	
,	
however	
,	
polysomnographic	
recording	
may	
show	
short	
sleep	
latency	
and	
early	
awakening	
with	
curtailment	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
ASWPD	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
“	
normal	
”	
sleep	
patterns	
,	
particularly	
among	
the	
elderly	
or	
very	
young	
,	
who	
often	
maintain	
advanced	
schedules	
without	
distress	
or	
impaired	
functioning	
.	

ASWPD	
must	
also	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
early	
awakening	
,	
including	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
.	

Poor	
sleep	
hygiene	
practices	
,	
partic-	
ularly	
evening	
napping	
among	
the	
elderly	
,	
and	
irregularity	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedule	
should	
also	
be	
considered	
.	

The	
possibility	
of	
a	
“	
free	
-	
running	
”	
(	
nonentrained	
)	
circadian	
rhythm	
also	
merits	
consideration	
,	
but	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
this	
condition	
are	
most	
commonly	
blind	
and	
report	
only	
periodic	
complaints	
of	
insomnia	
depending	
on	
the	
relative	
rela-	
tionship	
between	
the	
internal	
rhythm	
and	
that	
of	
the	
light	
/	
dark	
cycle	
.	

Major	
depressive	
disorder	
is	
a	
common	
cause	
of	
early	
awakening	
that	
must	
be	
considered	
.	

These	
patients	ORGANISM
do	
not	
typically	
manifest	
the	
early	
evening	
sleepiness	
that	
is	
characteristic	
of	
ASWPD	
.	

As	
with	
any	
sleep	
disturbances	
that	
persists	
over	
time	
,	
insomnia	
can	
develop	
second-	
arily	
.	

The	
Horne	
-	
Östberg	
questionnaire	
(	
or	
other	
chronotype	
questionnaire	
)	
may	
assist	
in	
determining	
the	
contribution	
of	
a	
morningness	
circadian	
preference	
to	
the	
presenting	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaint	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
more	
than	
one	
contributing	
variable	
seems	
to	
be	
the	
norm	
,	
and	
each	
entity	
needs	
to	
be	
treated	
accordingly	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

The	
existing	
literature	
suggests	
that	
clinicians	
are	
unlikely	
to	
encounter	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
stringently	
defined	
ASWPD	
.	

Until	
the	
identification	
of	
familial	
cohorts	
,	
only	
four	
cases	
were	
described	
.	

Various	
treatment	
trials	
also	
support	
this	
contention	
with	
demon-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
stration	
of	
objectively	
conventional	
sleep	
and	
wake	
times	
despite	
study	
entry	
based	
on	
subjective	
reports	
of	
advanced	
sleep	
phase	
.	

Select	
studies	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
sole	
complaints	
of	
maintenance	
insomnia	
/	
early	
-	
morning	
awakenings	
have	
demonstrated	
marked	
advances	
(	
earlier	
timing	
)	
of	
physiologically	
measured	
circadian	
rhythms	
.	

The	
absence	
of	
the	
early	
evening	
sleepiness	
complaint	
may	
be	
due	
to	
the	
fact	
that	
the	
timing	
of	
sleep	
onset	
can	
be	
more	
readily	
modified	
than	
wake	
time	
,	
and	
is	
likely	
to	
be	
more	
actively	
resisted	
due	
to	
its	
propensity	
to	
conflict	
with	
social	
or	
family	
obligations	
.	

Alternatively	
,	
evening	
sleep	
that	
occurs	
prior	
to	
entering	
the	
bed	
/	
bedroom	
may	
not	
be	
reported	
as	
such	
.	

If	
it	
is	
definitively	
demonstrated	
that	
the	
evening	
sleepiness	
complaint	
is	
not	
present	
or	
is	
not	
prominent	
,	
the	
term	
advance	
-	
related	
sleep	
complaints	
may	
be	
used	
in	
lieu	
of	
ASWPD	
.	

If	
this	
broader	
term	
is	
used	
,	
the	
condition	
is	
observed	
more	
commonly	
(	
~7	
%	
of	
respondents	
in	
a	
study	
of	
individuals	
aged	
40	
-	
64	
years	
)	
.	

There	
is	
limited	
knowledge	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
ASWPD	
(	
or	
advance	
-	
related	
sleep	
complaints	
)	
beyond	
those	
associated	
with	
select	
cases	
of	
familial	
ASWPD	
.	

Increased	
use	
of	
physiologic	
circadian	
assessments	
will	
require	
the	
development	
of	
normative	
values	
to	
guide	
practitioners	
.	

Knowledge	
gaps	
are	
even	
more	
prominent	
within	
pediat-	
ric	
and	
adolescent	
populations	
.

A.	ORGANISM

The	
patient	ORGANISM
or	
caregiver	
reports	
a	
chronic	
or	
recurrent	
pattern	
of	
irregular	
sleep	
and	
wake	
episodes	
throughout	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
period	
,	
characterized	
by	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	
during	
the	
scheduled	
sleep	
period	
(	
usually	
at	
night	
)	
,	
excessive	
sleepiness	
(	
napping	
)	
during	
the	
day	
,	
or	
both	
.

Essential	
Features	
Irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
rhythm	
disorder	
(	
ISWRD	
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
lack	
of	
a	
clearly	
defined	
circadian	
rhythm	
of	
sleep	
and	
wake	
.	

The	
chronic	
or	
recurring	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
is	
temporally	
disorganized	
so	
that	
sleep	
and	
wake	
episodes	
are	
variable	
throughout	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
.	

Individuals	
have	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	
and	
excessive	
sleepiness	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
time	
of	
day	
and	
their	
particular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
.	

Associated	
Features	
ISWRD	
is	
more	
commonly	
observed	
in	
neurodegenerative	
disorders	
,	
such	
as	
demen-	
tia	
,	
and	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
developmental	
disorders	
.	

Individuals	
typically	
present	
with	
insomnia	
or	
excessive	
sleepiness	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
time	
of	
day	
.	

Sleep	
and	
wake	
epi-	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
sodes	
across	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
are	
fragmented	
,	
with	
the	
longest	
sleep	
bout	
being	
typi-	
cally	
less	
than	
four	
hours	
.	

Individuals	
or	
caregivers	
report	
frequent	
naps	
throughout	
the	
daytime	
.	

Total	
sleep	
time	
across	
the	
24

may	
be	
normal	
for	
age	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Older	
adults	
with	
Alzheimer	
disease	
who	
experience	
sundowning	
may	
represent	
a	
clin-	
ical	
subtype	
with	
more	
severe	
sleep	
fragmentation	
and	
lower	
circadian	
rhythm	
ampli-	
tude	
than	
those	
who	
do	
not	
experience	
sundowning	
.	

Demographics	
Demographic	
patterns	
generally	
parallel	
those	
of

factors	
such	
as	
neuro-	
developmental	
and	
neurodegenerative	
disorders	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Neurodegenerative	
disorders	
such	
as	
Alzheimer	
disease	
,	
Parkinson	CANCER
disease	CANCER
,	
and	
Huntington	
disease	
increase	
the	
risk	
for	
ISWRD	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
with	
developmental	
disor-	
ders	CANCER
also	
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
ISWRD	
.	

Poor

hygiene	
and	
lack	
of	
exposure	
to	
external	
synchronizing	
agents	
such	
as	
light	
,	
activity	
,	
and	
social	
schedules	
may	
be	
predisposing	
as	
well	
as	
precipitating	
factors	
involved	
in	
the	
development	
of	
ISWRD	
,	
particularly	
in	
the	
institutionalized

and	
Complications	
Onset	
of	
the

may	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
.	

Little	
is	
known	
regarding	
the	
course	
and	
complications	
of	
ISWRD	
in	
adults	
.	

Due	
to	
the	
multiple	
awakenings	
and	
,	
in	
the	
elderly	
,	
nocturnal	
wandering	
,	
falls	
can	
be	
an	
indirect	
complication	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
sleep	
-	
wake	
dysfunction	
,	
the	
caregiver	
’s	
sleep	
is	
often	
disrupted	
.	

The	
sleep	
and	
wake	
disruption	
associated	
with	
ISWRD	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
a	
common	
cause	
of	
institutionalization	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Caregivers	
may	
report	
that	
a	
child	
with	
ISWRD	
has	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
the	
desired	
bedtime	
or	
“	
falls	
asleep	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
evening	
,	
wakes	
“	
too	
early	
”	
or	
has	
dif-	
ficulty	
waking	
in	
the	
morning	
,	
and/or	
exhibits	
developmentally	
inappropriate	
napping	
behavior	
during	
the	
day	
.	

Parents	
may	
complain	
that	
their	
child	
sleeps	
too	
much	
or	
too	
little	
or	
at	
inappropriate	
times	
.	

Attempts	
to	
keep	
the	
child	
awake	
during	
the	
day	
,	
especially	
during	
sedentary	
activities	
,	
are	
often	
unsuccessful	
.	

The	
key	
characteristics	
that	
distinguish	
ISWRD	
from	
other	
sleep	
complaints	
or	
circadian	
sleep	
wake	
disor-	
ders	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
are	
the	
lack	
of	
prolonged	
consolidated	
sleep	
periods	
,	
the	
often	
seemingly	
random	
distribution	
in	
sleep	
periods	
across	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
,	
and	
the	
marked	
day	
-	
to	
-	
day	
and	
week	
-	
to	
-	
week	
variability	
with	
little	
in	
the	
way	
of	
a	
clearly	
predictable	
major	
sleep-	
wake	
pattern	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
’	
sleep	
and	
daytime	
functioning	
is	
likely	
to	
be	
particularly	
profound	
.	

There	
may	
be	
phenotypes	
of	
ISWRD	
in	
children	ORGANISM
,	
with	
differences	
regarding	
symptom	
presentation	
and	
severity	
and	
chronicity	
that	
are	
related	
to	
the	
underlying	
condition	
.

For	
example	
,	
it	
is	
possible	
that	
children	ORGANISM
with	
chronic	
neurologic	
conditions	
such	
as	
autism	
or	
chromosomal	CELLULAR_COMPONENT
syndromes	
characterized	
by	
developmental	
delays	
may	
have	
a	
more	
intractable	
and	
treatment	
resistant	
pattern	
compared	
with	
children	ORGANISM
with	
more	
self	
-	
limited	
conditions	
(	
e.g.	
,	
postconcussion	
)	
.	

Although	
ISWRD	
appears	
to	
be	
rare	
in	
typically	
developing	
children	ORGANISM
,	
it	
may	
be	
envi-	
ronmentally	
or	
behaviorally	
induced	
.	

This	
may	
be	
seen	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
irregular	
or	
fragmented	
sleep	
and	
wake	
schedules	
because	
of	
a	
chaotic	
household	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
with	
developmental	
disorders	
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
ISWRD	
.	

For	
example	
,	
children	ORGANISM
with	
autism	
,	
Asperger	
syndrome	
,	
or	
pervasive	
developmental	
disorder	
not	
otherwise	
spec-	
ified	
often	
have	
highly	
irregular	
sleep	
patterns	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
these	
children	ORGANISM
often	
have	
circadian	
rhythm	
abnormalities	
which	
are	
both	
more	
severe	
and	
chronic	
and	
they	
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
relapse	
.	

Both	
ISWRD	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
and

are	
also	
common

in	
children	ORGANISM
with

Studies	
in

and	
adults	
with	
autism

and	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
Smith

have	
shown	
profound	
alterations	
in	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

profiles	
.	

Smith-	

Magenis	
syndrome	
is	
a	
developmental	
disorder	
caused	
by	
an	
abnormality	
in	
the	
short	
(	
p	
)	
arm	
of	
chromosome	
17	
.	

It	
is	
characterized	
by	
mild	
to	
moderate	
intellectual	
disabil-	
ity	
,	
distinctive	
facial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
features	
,	
sleep	
disturbances	
,	
and	
behavioral	
problems	
.	

Decreased	
concentrations	
of	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
its	
metabolites	
and	
daytime	
elevation	
and	
abnormal	
rhythm	
/	
decreased	
amplitude	
of	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
secretion	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
these	
popu-	
lations	
.	

These	
findings	
may	
be	
due	
to	
polymorphisms	
in	
melatonin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
enzymes	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
synthesis	
or	
variants	
in	
genes	
coding	
for	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
receptors	
.	

Other	
postulated	
mechanisms	
for	
circadian	
rhythm	
disturbances	
,	
particularly	
ISWRD	
,	
in	
these	
populations	
include	
clock	
gene	
polymorphisms	
and	
decreased	
levels	
of	
entrainment	
by	
social	
/	
environmental	
cues	
.	

There	
may	
also	
be	
medical	
conditions	
that	
predispose	
typically	
developing	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adolescents	
to	
ISWRD	
.	

These	
include	
traumatic

and	
chronic

,	
may	
have	
an	
increased	
prevalence	
of	
circadian

,	
including	
ISWRD	CANCER
.	

There	
is	
very	
little	
literature	
on	
ISWRD	
in	
the	
pediatric	
population	
;	
prevalence	
,

are	
unknown	
.	

Little	
is	
known	
about	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
the	
clinical	
entity	
of	
ISWRD	
in	
the	
pediatric	
population	
,	
including	
the	
impact	
of	
various	
treatment	
modalities	
,	
the	
likelihood	
of	
spontaneous	
resolution	
of	
symptoms	
,	
or	
long

consequences	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
neurodevelopmen-	
tal	
disorders	
and	
ISWRD	
may	
be	
particularly	
profound	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
ISWRD	
increases	
with	
advancing	
age	
,	
but	
it	
is	
likely	
that	
age	
-	
re-	
lated	
increase	
in	
neurodegenerative	
disorders	
,	
rather	
than	
aging	
per	
se	
,	
explains	
this	
relationship	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
etiology	
of	
ISWRD	
is	
likely	
multifactorial	
.	

Anatomic	
or	
functional	
abnormal-	
ities	
of	
the	
circadian	
clock	
can	
result	
in	
an	
arrhythmic	
pattern	
of	
rest	
and	
activity	
.	

Decreased	
exposure	
to	
environmental	
-	
entraining	
agents	
,	
such	
as	
light	
and	
structured	
physical	
and	
social	
activities	
(	
common	
in	
institutionalized	
elderly	
,	
and	
children	ORGANISM
with	
developmental	
disorders	
)	
,	
also	
can	
contribute	
to	
the	
development	
of	
an	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
.	

Objective	
Findings	

In	
addition	
to	
a	
careful	
sleep	
history	
,	
sleep	
log	
and	
actigraphy	
monitoring	
show	
the	
expected	
lack	
of	
a	
clearly	
defined	
circadian	
rhythm	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
,	
which	
,	
instead	
,	
is	
characterized	
by	
multiple	
irregular	
sleep	
and	
wake	
bouts	
throughout	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
period	
.	

The	
use	
of	
sleep	
log	
and	
actigraphy	
is	
indicated	
for	
the	
identification	
of	
irregular	
sleep	
wake	
rhythm	
.	

The	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
is	
defined	
as	
having	
multiple	
sleep	
bouts	
(	
typically	
2–4	
hours	
)	
during	
a	
24	
-	
hour	
period	
.	

The	
pattern	
may	
vary	
from	
day	
to	
day	
,	
thus	
monitoring	
for	
at	
least	
seven	
days	
and	
preferably	
14	
days	
may	
be	
needed	
to	
differentiate	
the	
irregular	
pattern	
from	
other	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep-	
wake	
disorders	
.	

Polysomnography	
is	
not	
required	
to	
establish	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

Polysomnography	
may	
be	
useful	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
other	
comorbid	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

Monitoring	
of	
other	
circa-	
dian	
rhythms	
,	
such	
as	
core	
body	
temperature	
and	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
for	
at	
least	
24	
hours	
,	
may	
also	
show	
a	
loss	
of	
clear	
circadian	
rhythmicity	
or	
a	
low	
amplitude	
rhythm	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Poor	
sleep	
hygiene	
and	
voluntary	
maintenance	
of	
irregular	
sleep	
schedules	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
.	

Individuals	
with	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
rhythms	
may	
present	
with	
complaints	
of	
insomnia	
.	

Careful	
analysis	
of	
sleep	
logs	
or	
actigraphy	
will	
demonstrate	
multiple	
irregular	
periods	
of	
sleep	
throughout	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
.

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
is	
limited	
knowledge	
of	
the	
pathophysiology

and	
complications	
of

Further	
research	
into	
the	
relative	
contribution	
of	
alterations	
in	
environmental	
synchronizing	
agents	
,	
such	
as	
light	
and

,	
versus	
a	
dysfunction	
of	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
clock	
in	
the	
development	
of	
irregular	
sleep	
and	
wake	
patterns	
will	
lead	
to	
improved	
understanding	
of	
this	
condition

Notes	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
may	
present	
with	
a	
progressively	
delaying	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
and	
intermittent	
insomnia	
and	
excessive	
sleepiness	
.	

Individual	
symptoms	
will	
depend	
on	
when	
an	
individual	
tries	
to	
sleep	
in	
relation	
to	
the	
circadian	
rhythm	
of	
sleep	
-	
wake	
propensity	
.	

The	
magnitude	
of	
the	
daily	
delay	
will	
depend	
on	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
period	
,	
and	
may	
range	
from	
less	
than	
30	
minutes	
(	
when	
the	
period	
is	
close	
to	
24	
hours	
)	
to	
more	
than	
an	
hour	
(	
when	
the	
period	
is	
longer	
than	
25	
hours	
)	
.	
.	

The	
symptomatic	
episode	
will	
typically	
begin	
with	
a	
gradual	
increase	
in	
sleep	
latency	
and	
delayed	
sleep	
onset	
.	

As	
the	
sleep	
propensity	
rhythm	
shifts	
into	
the	
daytime	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
will	
have	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
night	
and	
staying	
awake	
during	
the	
day	
.	

As	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
propensity	
rhythm	
drifts	
further	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
will	
eventually	
complain	
of	
late	
afternoon	
and	
evening	
sleepiness	
and	
naps	
as	
well	
as	
an	
early	
sleep	
onset	
time	
and	
short	
sleep

Essential

Non-24

disorder	
(	
N24SWD	
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	
or	
excessive	
sleepiness	
that	
occur	
because	
the	
intrinsic	
circadian	
pace-	
maker	
is	
not	
entrained	
to	
a	
24	
-	
hour	
light	
/	
dark	
cycle	
.	

The	
non-24	
-	
hour	
period	
can	
be	
shorter	
or	
,	
more	
typically	
,	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

Because	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
is	
not	
aligned	
to	
the	
external	
24	
-	
hour	
environment	
,	
symptoms	
will	
depend	
on	
when	
an	
individual	
tries	
to	
sleep	
in	
relation	
to	
the	
circadian	
rhythm	
of	
sleep	
and	
wake	
propensity	
.	

Individuals	
typically	
present	
with	
episodes	
of	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
or	
staying	
asleep	
,	
excessive	
sleepiness	
or	
both	
,	
alternating	
with	
short	
asymp-	
tomatic	
periods	
.	

The	
severity	
of	
individual	
sleep	
-	
wake	
symptoms	
can	
be	
variable	
.	

Starting	
with	
the	
asymptomatic	
period	
when	
the	
individual	
’s	
endogenous	
rhythm	
is	
aligned	
to	
the	
external	
environment	
and	
required	
sleep	
-	
wake	
times	
,	
sleep	
latency	
will	
gradually	
increase	
and	
the	
individual	
will	
complain	
of	
sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	
.	

As	
the	
sleep	
phase	
continues	
to	
drift	
so	
that	
maximal	
endogenous	
sleep	
propensity	
is	
now	
in	
the	
daytime	
,	
individuals	
will	
have	
trouble	
staying	
awake	
during	
the	
day	
(	
exhibiting	
multiple	
daytime	
naps	
)	
and	
complain	
of	
sleepiness	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Most	
individuals	
with	
nonentrained	
circadian	
rhythms	
are	
totally	
blind	
,	
and	
the	
failure	
to	
entrain	
circadian	
rhythms	
is	
related	
to	
the	
lack	
of	
photic	
input	
to	
the	
cir-	
cadian	
pacemaker	
.	

A	
small	
proportion	
of	
totally	
blind	
people	ORGANISM
may	
retain	
functional	
circadian	
photoreception	
and	
entrained	
rhythms	
if	
their	
blindness	
is	
due	
exclusively	
to	
an	
outer	
retina	
disorder	
(	
rod	
and	
cone	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
layer	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
)	
with	
retention	
of	
functional	
,	
intrin-	
sically	
photosensitive	
retinal	CELL
ganglion	CELL
cells	CELL
and	
the	
retinohypothalamic	
pathway	
.	

Some	
blind	
people	ORGANISM
may	
also	
be	
able	
to	
entrain	
to	
nonphotic	
cues	
(	
e.g.	
,	
the	
timing	
of	
physical	
activity	
)	
,	
producing	
entrainment	
at	
an	
adverse	
phase	
in	
some	
cases	
.	

In	
sighted	
people	ORGANISM
,	
social	
and	
behavioral	
factors	
also	
play	
an	
important	
role	
in	
the	
development	
and	
maintenance	
of	
the	
disorder	
,	
as	
there	
is	
an	
increased	
incidence	
of	
psychiatric	
disorders	
.	

Occasionally	
,	
the	
disorder	
is	
associated	
with	
developmental	
intellectual	
disability	
or	
dementia	
.	

In	
sighted	
individuals	
,	
there	
is	
often	
a	
history	
of	
delayed	
sleep	
phase	
,	
and	
decreased	
exposure	
to	
light	
and	
structured	
social	
and	
phys-	
ical	
activity	
.	

Some	
sighted	
individuals	
with	
N24SWD	
also	
demonstrate	
increased	
sleep	
duration	
.	

Demographics	
It	
is	
thought	
that	
over	
half	
of	
totally	
blind	
individuals	
have	
non-24

dian	
rhythms	
;	
50	
%

In

the

by	
certain	
environmental

Caregivers	
may	
report	
that	
a	
child	
has	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
the	
desired	
bedtime	
or	
“	
falls

may	
complain	
that	
their

sleeps	
too

or	
too

The	
key	
characteristics	
that	
distinguish	
N24SWD	
from	
other	
sleep	
complaints	
or	
circadian	
sleep	
wake	
dis-	
orders	
are	
twofold	
:	
(

)	
the	
predictable	
pattern	
of	
misalignment	
between	
the	
child	
’s	
sleep	
patterns	
and	
the	
light	
-	
dark	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
(	
progressive	
delay	
in	
sleep	
onset	
-	
offset	
across

to	
weeks	
)	
;	
and	
(

)	
periods	
of	
apparent	
“	
symptom	
remission	
”	
during	
those	
transient	
intervals	
when	
the	
child	
’s	
circadian	
sleep	
-	
wake	
propensity	
coincides	
with	
the	
desired	
bed	
and	
wake	
times	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
’	
sleep	
and	
daytime	
functioning	
is	
often	
profound	
.	

Although	
N24SWD	
is	
extremely	
rare	
in	
typically	
developing	
or	
sighted	
children	ORGANISM
,	
it	
has	
been	
reported	
with	
some	
frequency	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
intellectual	
disabilities	
and	
blindness	
.	

For	
example	
,	
children	ORGANISM
with	
optic	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE

hypoplasia	
due	
to	
a	
variety	
of	
under-

those

callosum	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
and	
comor-	CELL

severe	
intellectual	
and	
visual	
impairments	
,	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
have	
features	
of	
N24SWD	
.	
N24SWD	
has	
also	
been	
described	
in	
pediatric	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
Rett	
syndrome	
(	
a	
genetic	
disorder	
occurring	
almost	
exclusively	
in	
girls	
,	
characterized	
by	
severe	
developmental	
regression	
,	
language	
delays	
,	
and	
limited	
social	
interactions	
)	
,	
autism

,	
and	
Angelman

,	
a	
neurodevelopmental	
disorder	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
an	
abnormality	
of	
chromosome	
15q11	
-	
q13	
.	

The	
common	
mechanism	
in	
all	
of	
these	
disorders	
is	
postulated	
to	
be	
lack	
of	
entrainment	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
that	
results	
from	
the	
failure	
to	
perceive	
and/or	
attend	
to	
social	
/	
environmental	
zeitgebers	
(	
time	
cues	
)	
.	

There	
have	
also	
been	
several	
case	
reports	
which	
describe	
the	
emergence	
of	
N24SWD	
in	
intellectually	
normal	
sighted	
children	ORGANISM
or	
adolescents	
who	
have	
limited	
or	
inappropriate	
exposure	
to	
environmental	
and	
other	
entraining	
cues	
(

and/or

evening	
)	
.	

These	
individuals	
are	
likely	
to	
have	
significant	
psychiatric	
impairments	
that	
predispose	
them	
to	
avoid-	
ance	
of	
social	
interactions	
(	
e.g.

or	
medical

Little	
is	
known	
about	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
the	
clinical	
entity	
of	
N24SWD	
in	
the	
pedi-

population

including	
the

the	
likelihood	
of	
spontaneous	
resolution	
of

There	
may	
be	
varying

N24SWD	
in

with	
differences	
in	
regard	
to	
symptom	
presentation	
,	
severity	
,	
and	
chronicity	
that	
are	
related	
to	
the	
underlying	
condition	
.	

For	
example	
,	
it	
is	
likely	
that	
children	ORGANISM
with	
chronic	
neurologic	
conditions	
such	
as	
blindness	
or	
neurodevelopmental	
disabilities	
have	
a	
more	
intractable

,	
the	
course	
is

Attempts	
to

may	
involve	
the	
use	
of

which	
in

Depressive

can	
be

in

The	
adverse	
effects	
on	
school

as	
well	
as

due	
to	
a

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
intrinsic	
period	
of	
the	
human	ORGANISM
circadian	ORGANISM
pacemaker	ORGANISM
is	
usually	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
and	
requires	
daily	
input	
from	
the	
environment	
to	
maintain	
synchrony	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
.	

The	
light	
-	
dark	
cycle	
is	
the	
most	
important	
environmental	
time	
cue	
(	
zeitgeber	
)	
in	
humans	ORGANISM
(	
as	
in	
other	
species	
)	
,	
although	
nonphotic	
time	
cues	
also	
play	
a	
role	
in	
normal	
entrainment	
.	

A	
lack	
of	
photic	
input	
to	
the	
circadian	
pacemaker	
is	
clearly	
the	
cause	
of	
nonentrained	
rhythms	
in	
totally	
blind	
people	ORGANISM
.	

It	
has	
been	
suggested	
that	
,	
in	
sighted	
individuals	
,	
a	
systematic	
delay	
due	
to	
inadequate	
exposure	
to	
light	
may	
contribute	
to	
the	
development	
of	
N24SWD	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
disorder	
may	
be	
caused	
by	
an	
extremely	
prolonged	
endogenous	
circadian	
period	
that	
is	
outside	
of	
the	
range	
for	
entrainment	
to	
the

cycle	
or	
by	
an	
alteration	
in	
the	
response	
of	
the	
circadian	
clock	
to	
the	
entraining	
effects	
of	
light	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Sleep	
studies	
yield	
different	
results	
depending	
on	
the	
degree	
of	
synchrony	
between	
sleep	
times	
and	
the	
circadian	
pacemaker	
at	
the	
time	
when	
the	
sleep	
study	
is	
performed	
.	

Recording	
of	
sleep	
log	
and	
actigraphy	
over	
prolonged	
periods	
(	
at	
least	
14	
days	
,	
but	
ideally	
longer	
in	
blind	
individuals	
)	
demonstrate	
the	
lack	
of	
a	
stable	
relationship	
between	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
and	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
.	

When	
sleep	
sched-	
ules	
follow	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
propensity	
for	
sleep	
and	
wake	
,	
sleep	
onset	
and	
wake	
times	
are	
typically	
delayed	
each	
day	
.	

Serial	
measurements	
of	
circadian	
rhythms	
,	
such	
as	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
usually	
show	
a	
progressive	
daily	
delay	
of	
the	
phase	
of	
the	
rhythm	
consistent	
with	
a	
period	
that	
is	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiologic	
Subtypes	
Totally	
blind	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
N24SWD	
are	
clinically	
different	
than	
sighted	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

In	
sighted	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
N24SWD	
,	
the	
circadian	
period	
is	
often	
25	
hours	
or	
longer	
,	
whereas	
in	
totally	
blind	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
the	
disorder	
,	
the	
circadian	
period	
follows	
an	
average	
period	
length	
which	
is	
often	
closer	
to	
24	
hours	
and	
rarely	
may	
be	
shorter	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

Some	
individuals	
with	
severe	
DSWPD	
may	
demonstrate	
progressive	
delay	
of	
their	
sleep	
period	
by	
30	
minutes	
or	
more	
for	
several	
days	
,	
and	
their	
symptoms	
may	
be	
con-	
fused	
with	
N24SWD	
.	

Behavioral	
factors	
and	
psychiatric	
disorders	
,	
as	
well	
as	
medical	
and	
neurological	
dis-	
orders	
(	
especially	
blindness	
,	
but	
also	
dementia	
or	
mental	
retardation	
)	
,	
may	
play	
a	
role	
in	
the	
development	
of	
N24SWD	
.	

In	
many	
of	
these	
cases	
,	
however	
,	
multiple	
physio-	
logic	
,	
behavioral	
,	
and	
environmental	
factors	
contribute	
to	
the	
condition	
.	

In	
the	
major-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
ity	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
of	
these	
cases	
,	
the	
disorder	
should	
be	
coded	
as	
N24SWD	
.	

This	
includes	
non-24-	
hour	
sleep	
-	
wake	
patterns	
that	
are	
associated	
with	
blindness	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
is	
only	
limited	
knowledge	
of	
the	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
sighted	
persons	ORGANISM
with	
N24SWD	
.	

The	
primary	
risk	
factor	
in	
sighted	
persons	ORGANISM
appears	
to	
be	
a	
long	
circa-	
dian	
period	
that	
is	
beyond	
the	
range	
of	
entrainment	
to	
a	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
or	
a	
progressive	
delay	
due	
to	
inappropriate	
exposure	
to	
light	
.	

This	
risk	
may	
explain	
the	
overlap	
between	
DSWPD	
and	
N24SWD	
.	

Future	
studies	
are	
needed	
to	
understand	
the	
role	
of	
genetic	
predisposition	
,	
environmental	
or	
social	
cues	
and	
traumatic

injury	
in	
the	
develop-	
ment

and	
to

A.	ORGANISM

There	
is	
a	
report	
of	
insomnia	
and/or	
excessive	
sleepiness	
,	
accompanied	
by	
a	
reduction	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
,	
which	
is	
associated	
with	
a	
recurring	
work	
schedule	
that	
overlaps	
the	
usual	
time	
for	
sleep	
.	

B.	
The	
symptoms	
have	
been	
present	
and	
associated	
with	
the	
shift	
work	
schedule	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
.

(	
whenever	
possible	
and	
preferably	
with

at	
least	
14	
days	
(	
work	
and	
free	
days	
)	
demonstrate	
a	
disturbed	
sleep	
and	
wake	
pattern	
.	

D.	

The	
sleep	
and/or	
wake	
disturbance	
are	
not	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
current

Essential	
Features	
Shift	
work	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
by	
complaints	
of	
insomnia	
or	
excessive	
sleepi-	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
ness	
that	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
work	
hours	
that	
occur	
,	
at	
least	
in	
part	
,	
during	
the	
usual	
sleep	
episode	
.	

There	
are	
several	
types	
of	
shift	
-	
work	
schedules	
,	
including	
evening	
shifts	
,	
night	
shifts	
,	
early	
morning	
shifts	
,	
rotating	
shifts	
,	
split	
shifts	
,	
on	
-	
call	
overnight	
duty	
,	
and	
long	
duration	
work	
shifts	
that	
include	
work	
hours	
at	
night	
.	

The	
sleep	
distur-	
bance	
is	
most	
commonly	
reported	
in	
association	
with	
night	
shifts	
,	
early	
morning	
shifts	
,	
and	
rotating	
shifts	
.	

Total	
sleep	
time	
is	
typically	
curtailed	
by	
one	
to	
four	
hours	
,	
and	
sleep	
quality	
is	
perceived	
as	
unsatisfactory	
in	
night	
,	
early	
morning	
,	
and	
rotating	
shift	
workers	
as	
well	
as	
in	
those	
who	
work	
long	
-	
duration	
shifts	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
impairment	
of	
performance	
at	
work	
,	
reduced	
alertness	
may	
also	
be	
associated	
with	
consequences	
for	
safety	
during	
the	
work	
schedule	
and	
on	
the	
commute	
to	
and	
from	
work	
.	

The	
sleep	
disorder	
occurs	
despite	
attempts	
to	
optimize	
environmental	
conditions	
for	
sleep	
.	

The	
condition	
usually	
persists	
only	
for	
the	
duration	
of	
the	
shift	
work	
schedule	
.	

However	
,	
in	
some	
individuals	
,	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
may	
persist	
beyond	
the	
duration	
of	
shift	
work	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Early	
morning	
work	
shifts	
starting	
between	
4:00	
a.m.	
and	
7:00	
a.m.	
can	
also	
be	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
complaints	
of	
difficulty	
in	
sleep	
initiation	
as	
well	
as	
difficulty	
awakening	
.	

Circadian	
Rhythm	
Sleep	
-	
Wake	
Disorders	
Permanent	
evening	
shifts	
may	
be	
primarily	
associated	
with	
sleep	
maintenance	
dif-	
ficulty	
.	

Excessive	
sleepiness	
usually	
occurs	
during	
work	
shifts	
(	
mainly	
night	
,	
early	
morning	
,	
and	
rotating	
shifts	
)	
,	
often	
accompanied	
by	
the	
need	
to	
nap	
and	
by	
impaired	
mental	
ability	
due	
to	
the	
reduced	
alertness	
.	

Reduced	
alertness	
and	
increased	
fatigue	
throughout	
the	
waking	
period	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
reduced	
performance	
capacity	
,	
and	
with	
consequences	
for	
safety	
.	

Also	
,	
major	
portions	
of	
free	
time	
may	
have	
to	
be	
used	
for	
recovery	
of	
sleep	
,	
resulting	
in	
adverse	
social	
consequences	
.	

When	
compared	
with	
shift	
workers	
without	
shift	
work	
disorder	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
shift	
work	
disorder	
report	
greater	
mood	
problems	
,	
such	
as	
impatience	
,	
avoidance	
of	
interaction	
with	
coworkers	
,	
a	
higher	
risk	
of	
depression	
,	
impaired	
social	
functioning	
,	
and	
lower	
coping	
skills	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
shift	
work	
disorder	
also	
have	
a	
higher	
risk	
of	
subjective	
health	
complaints	
,	
ulcers	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
and	
substance	
abuse	
.	

Risk	
for	
sleepiness	
-	
related	
errors	
and	
accidents	
are	
highest	
at	
night	
,	
especially	
in	
the	
early	
morning	
hours	
.	

Drowsy	
driving	
accident	
risk	
is	
highest	
in	
the	
morning	
hours	
when	
night	
shift	
workers	
commute	
home	
and	
early	
morning	
workers	
commute	
to	
work	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
There	
are	
substantial	
individual	
differences	
in	
the	
ability	
to	
adjust	
to	
shift	
work	
.	

However	
,	
mechanisms	
underlying	
these	
individual	
differences	
are	
not	
known	
.	

Requirement	
of	
extended	
work	
hours	
,	
such	
as	
on	
-	
call	
overnight	
duty	
and	
long	
-	
duration	
work	
shifts	
that	
include	
work	
hours	
at	
night	
,	
represents	
a	
specific	
clinical	
subtype	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
circadian	
misalignment	
(	
having	
to	
work	
during	
the	
night	
)	
,	
sleep	
loss	
and	
fatigue	
associated	
with	
prolonged	
continuous	
work	
may	
increase	
the	
severity	
of	
excessive	
sleepiness	
and	
performance	
impairments	
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
depends	
on	
the	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
in	
the	
population	
.	

It	
has	
been	
estimated	
that	
approximately	
20	
%	
of	
the	
workforce	
in	
indus-	
trialized	
countries	
is	
employed	
in	
a	
job	
that	
requires	
shift	
work	
.	

Although	
the	
actual	
prevalence	
of	
clinically	
significant	
sleep	
disturbance	
and	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
due	
to	
work	
schedules	
is	
unknown	
,	
the	
total	
number	
of	
night	
-	
shift	
workers	
suggests	
that	
an	
estimated	
prevalence	
of	
2	
%	
to	
5	
%	
of	
the	
general	
population	
is	
reasonable	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
among	
rotating-	
and	
night	
-	
shift	
workers	
has	
been	
estimated	
to	
be	
between	
~10	
%	
and	
38	
%	
.	

These	
figures	
do	
not	
,	
however	
,	
include	
individuals	
with	
early	
morning	
or	
split	
shift	
work	
,	
which	
may	
be	
other	
at	
-	
risk	
groups	
.	

There	
is	
no	
known	
sex	
or	
racial	
difference	
in	
vulnerability	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Depending	
on	
the	
type	
of	
shift	
,	
circadian	
preference	
may	
influence	
the	
ability	
to	
adjust	
to	
or	
tolerate	
shift	
work	
.	

For	
example	
,	
individuals	
described	
as	
morning	
types

individuals	
with

sleep	
may	
be	
at	
particular	
risk	
.	

Social	
pressures	
before

after	
a

shift	
also	
contribute	
to	
short	
sleep	
durations	
in

social	
inter-	
actions

domestic

,	
a

and	
leisure	
activ-

)	
.	

Social	
pressures	
also	
diminish	
the	
desire	
or	
willingness	
to	
maintain	
a	
consis-	
tent

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	

The	
condition	
is	
closely	
linked	
to	
work	
schedules	
and	
typically	
remits	
when	
the	
major	
sleep	
episode	
is	
scheduled	
at	
a	
conventional	
time	
.	

Because	
there	
are	
so	
many	
different	
work	
schedules	
,	
ranging	
from	
an	
occasional	
overnight	
shift	
to	
regular	
night	
work	
,	
the	
course	
is	
quite	
variable	
.	

Because	
shift	
work	
is	
often	
combined	
with	
extended	
hours	
of	
duty	
,	
fatigue	
can	
be	
a	
complicating	
factor	
.	

Circadian	
adaptation	
is	
often	
counteracted	
by	
exposure	
to	
light	
at	
the	
wrong	
time	
of	
the	
day	
and	
the	
tendency	
of	
most	
workers	
to	
resume	
full	
daytime	
activities	
and	
nighttime	
sleep	
during	
weekends	
and	
vacations	
.	

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
in	
some	
individuals	
,	
the	
condition	
may	
lead	
to	
chronic	
sleep	
disturbances	
.	

Complications	
may	
include	
exacerbation	
of	
gastrointestinal	CANCER

,	
neoplastic	
,	
and

Disruptions	
of	
social	
and	
family	
life	
are	
frequent	
.	

Drug

dependency	
may	
result	
from	
attempts	
to	
improve	
the	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
disturbances	
produced	
by	
shift	
work	
.	

Fatigue	
and	
excessive	
sleepiness	
due	
to	
the	
combination	
of	
sleep	
loss	
and	
circadian	
misalignment	
pose	
important	
safety	
concerns	
.	

The	
level	
of	
alertness	
required	
of	
the	
worker	
,	
in	
addi-	
tion	
to	
the	
intensity	
of	
symptoms	
,	
needs	
to	
be	
taken	
into	
account	
when	
evaluating	
the	
disorder	
.	

For	
example	
,	
the	
threshold	
for	
intervention	
may	
be	
lower	
for	
workers	
whose	
performance	
is	
critical

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	

The	
condition	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
directly	
related	
to	
circadian	
misalignment	
and	
sleep	
loss	
.	

The	
sleep	
disturbance	
is	
generated	
by	
a	
circadian	
alerting	
process	
that	
corre-	
sponds	
with	
the	
time	
that	
the	
worker	
needs	
to	
sleep	
.	

The	
excessive	
sleepiness	
during	
the	
night	
and	
early	
morning	
appears	
to	
be	
partly	
related	
to	
cumulative	
sleep	
loss	
and	
partly	
due	
to	
a	
decreased	
circadian	
alerting	
signal	
that	
corresponds	
with	
the	
work	
time	
and	
the	
commute	
to	
and	
from	
work	
.	

Tolerance	
to	
night	
work	
varies	
considerably	
and	
may	
involve	
differences	
in	
the	
degree	
of	
circadian	
adaptation	
(	
“	
clock	
resetting	
”	
)	
to	
a	
night	
-	
work	
,	
day	
-	
sleep	
schedule	
.	

Alternatively	
,	
tolerance	
may	
be	
related	
to	
individual	
differences	
in	
response	
to	
circadian	
and	
homeostatic	
influences	
on	
sleep	
and	
wakeful-	
ness	
regulation	
.	

Environmental	
and	
social	
factors	
may	
exacerbate	
sleep	
loss	
associated	
with	
shift	
work	
schedules	
.	

Objective	
Findings	

The	
condition	
can	
usually	
be	
diagnosed	
by	
history	
.	

Sleep	
logs	
and	
actigraphy	
are	
rec-	
ommended	
to	
demonstrate	
a	
disrupted	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
consistent	
with	
shift	
work	
disorder	
.	

Polysomnographic	
recordings	
,	
while	
not	
required	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
,	
are	
useful	
if	
the	
etiology	
of	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
is	
in	
question	
(	
for	
example	
to	
rule	
out	
sleep	
apnea	
or	
narcolepsy	
)	
.	

Polysomnography	
during	
a	
typical	
daytime	
sleep	
episode	
after	
a	
work	
shift	
also	
can	
be	
useful	
to	
determine	
the	
severity	
of	
the	
sleep	
disruption	
,	
although	
this	
is	
undertaken	
almost	
exclusively	
for	
research	
studies	
of	
shift	
work	
disor-	
der	
.	

Polysomnography	
may	
demonstrate	
impaired	
sleep	
quality	
,	
with	
prolonged	
sleep	
latency	
,	
sleep	
maintenance	
difficulty	
,	
or	
shortened	
total	
sleep	
time	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
sleep	
episode	
in	
relation	
to	
the	
underlying	
phase	
of	
the	
circadian	
timing	
system	
.	

The	
sleep	
episode	
may	
be	
fragmented	
,	
with	
frequent	
arousals	
and	
awaken-	
ings	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

The	
Multiple	
Sleep	
Latency	
Test	
(	
MSLT	
)	
may	
demonstrate	
excessive	
sleepiness	
during	
the	
time	
of	
the	
work	
shift	
.	

If	
available	
,	
measures	
of	
the	
unmasked	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
rhythm	
are	
useful	
to	
indicate	
the	
degree	
of	
circadian	
misalignment	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
excessive	
sleepiness	
should	
be	
differentiated	
from	
that	
caused	
by	
other	
primary	
sleep	
disorders	
such	
as	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
or	
narcolepsy	
.	

Insufficient	
sleep	
related	
to	
conflicting	
daytime	
activities	
(	
for	
example	
,	
child	
care	
)	
or	
from	
environmental	
interference	
with	
sleep	
(	
for	
example	
,	
daytime	
noise	
)	
often	
contributes	
to	
sleepiness	
.	

Sometimes	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
DSWPD	
may	
adopt	
a	
night	
-	
work	
schedule	
that	
is	
more	
con-	
gruent	
with	
their	
sleep	
preferences	
.	

Insomnia	
and	
excessive	
sleepiness	
may	
also	
suggest	
other	
persistent	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep	
-	
wake	
disorders	
.	

However	
,	
historical	
informa-	
tion	
on	
the	
relation	
between	
the	
occurrence	
of	
disturbed	
sleep	
and	
work	
-	
hour	
distribu-	
tion	
should	
provide	
sufficient	
information	
to	
indicate	
the	
correct	
diagnosis	
.	

Increasing	
frustration	
,	
negative	
expectations	
,	
and	
poor	
sleep	
hygiene	
may	
predispose	
the	
person	
to	
the	
development	
of	
coexisting	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
that	
could	
persist	
beyond	
the	
shift	
work	
schedule	
(	
i.e.	
,	
shift	
work	
may	
represent	
a	
precipitating	
event	
that	
leads	
to	
chronic	
problems	
with	
insomnia	
)	
.	

Drug	
and	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
abuse	
or	
dependency	
may	
result	
from	
efforts	
to	
treat	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Although	
there	
is	
sufficient	
information	
regarding	
the	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
in	
indus-	
trialized	
populations	
,	
less	
information	
is	
available	
regarding	
the	
actual	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
and	
its	
impact	
on	
health	
and	
safety	
.	

Further	
research	
is	
needed	
to	
improve	
the	
definition	
of	
what	
constitutes	
shift	
work	
disorder	
,	
to	
develop	
diagnostic	
tools	
for	
shift	
work	
disorder	
,	
to	
determine	
the	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
using	
diagnostic	
criteria	
,	
to	
elucidate	
the	
burden	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
over	
and	
above	
that	
which	
may	
be	
due	
to	
shift	
work	
in	
general	
,	
to	
investigate	
mechanisms	
underlying	
the	
health	
and	
safety	
consequences	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
,	
and	
to	
determine	
which	
shift	
workers	
are	
at	
greatest	
risk	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
there	
is	
limited	
information	
on	
the	
role	
of	
age	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
circadian	
chronotype	
on	
the	
vulnerability	
to	
shift	
work	
disorder

Essential	
Features	
Jet	
lag	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
temporary	
mismatch	
between	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
sleep	
and	
wake	
cycle	
generated	
by	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
clock	
and	
that	
of	
the	
sleep	
and	
wake	
pattern	
required	
by	
a	
change	
in	
time	
zone	
.	

Individuals	
complain	
of	
disturbed	
sleep	
,	
sleepiness	
and	
fatigue	
,	
and	
impaired	
daytime	
function	
.	

The	
severity	
and	
duration	
of	
symptoms	
is	
dependent	
on	
the	
number	
of	
time	
zones	
traveled	
,	
the	
ability	
to	
sleep	
while	
traveling	
,	
exposure	
to	
appropriate	
circadian	
times	
cues	
in	
the	
new	
environment	
,	
tolerance	
to	
circadian	
misalignment	
when	
awake	
during	
the	
bio-	
logical	
night	
,	
and	
the	
direction	
of	
the	
travel	
.	

Eastward	
travel	
(	
requiring	
advancing	
circadian	
rhythms	
and	
sleep	
-	
wake	
hours	
)	
is	
usually	
more	
difficult	
to	
adjust	
to	
than	
westward	
travel	
.	

Associated	
Features	

In	
addition	
to	
sleep	
disturbance	
and	
decreased	
daytime	
alertness	
,	
associated	
features	
may	
include	
general	
malaise	
and	
gastrointestinal	
symptoms	
.	

Numerous	
other	
variables	
related	
to	
travel	
,	
such	
as	
sleep	
loss	
,	
decreased	
mobility	
,	
and	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and/or	
caffeine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
intake	
,	
contribute	
to	
the	
overall	
fatigue	
.	

Daytime	
sleepiness	
can	
lead	
to	
memory	
diffi-	
culties	
,	
problems	
concentrating	
,	
driving	
and	
flying	
,	
and	
to	
impaired	
decision	
-	
making	
.	

Sleepiness	
,	
sleep	
disturbance	
and	
circadian	
misalignment	
associated	
with	
jet	
lag	
may	
also	
impair	
athletic	
performance	
.	

Effects	
of	
jet	
lag	
not	
only	
affect	
travelers	
,	
but	
also	
can	
have	
significant	
consequences	
for	
airline	
pilots	
and	
flight	
attendants	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
There	
are	
individual	
differences	
in	
the	
ability	
to	
adjust	
to	
rapid	
shifts	
in	
time	
zones	
;	
however	
,	
specific	
clinical	
subtypes	
have	
not	
been	
identified	
.	

Demographics	
Jet	
lag	
affects	
all	
age	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
racial	
groups	
.	

Limited	
available	
data	
suggest	
that	
older	
individuals	
may	
experience	
fewer	
jet	
lag	
symptoms	
compared	
with	
younger	
individu-	
als	
.	

However	
,	
the	
data	
have	
limitations	
and	
further	
research	
is	
needed	
to	
better	
define	
the	
relationship	
between	
age	
and	
the	
development	
of	
jet	
lag	
disorder	
.	

There	
are	
no	
studies	
on	
the	
prevalence	
of	
jet	
lag	
disorder	
.

and	
excessive	
caffeine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

may	
increase	
the	
severity	
of	
insomnia	
and	
impaired	
alertness	
and	
function	
associated	
with	
transmeridian	
travel	
.	

Eastward	
travel	
often	
leads	
to	
difficulties	
with	
sleep	
onset	
as	
attempts	
to	
sleep	
are	
made	
at	
an	
earlier	
internal	
circadian	
time	
when	
the	
travelers	
’	
biological	
clock	
is	
pro-	
moting	
alertness	
(	
i.e.	
,	
biological	
day	
)	
.	

Difficulty	
awakening	
and	
daytime	
sleepiness	
and	
fatigue	
occur	
because	
wake	
time	
also	
occurs	
at	
an	
earlier	
biological	
time	
when	
the	
circadian	
clock	
is	
still	
promoting	
sleep	
(	
i.e.	
,	
during	
the	
travelers	
’	
biological	
night	
)	
.	

Westward	
jet	
travel	
often	
leads	
to	
sleepiness	
and	
fatigue	
in	
the	
evening	
hours	
of	
the	
new	
time	
zone	
as	
the	
internal	
circadian	
clock	
of	
the	
traveler	
is	
promoting	
sleep	
(	
i.e.	
,	
biological	
night	
)	
.	

Sleep	
disturbance	
in	
the	
new	
time	
zone	
is	
typically	
manifest	
as	
a	
sleep	
maintenance	
issue	
with	
early	
morning	
awakenings	
and	
difficulty	
returning	
to	
sleep	
because	
the	
internal	
circadian	
clock	
of	
the	
traveler	
is	
promoting	
wakefulness	
during	
the	
sleep	
episode	
(	
i.e.	
,	
biological	
day	
)	
.	

Basic	
circadian	
science	
principles	
suggest	
that	
inappropriately	
timed	
exposure	
to	
light	
and	
darkness	
during	
and	
immediately	
after	
jet	
travel	
can	
shift	
the	
circadian	
clock	
in	
the	
wrong	
direction	
,	
thereby	
increasing	
the	
duration	
of	
jet	
lag	
symptoms	
.	

Time	
at	
destina-	
tion	
upon	
arrival	
may	
also	
influence	
jet	
lag	
symptoms	
with	
fewer	
symptoms	
reported	
following	
midday	
arrivals	
after	
eastward	
travel	
.	

An	
individual	
’s	
innate	
circadian	
preference	
may	
also	
confer	
a	
greater	
or	
lesser	
ability	
to	
adjust	
to	
a	
particular	
time	
shift	
,	
but	
this	
finding	
has	
not	
been	
systematically	
assessed

Jet

is	
often

to	
be	
worse	
after

than	
westward

.	

Westward	
travel	
may	
generally	
be	
easier	
because	
the	
genetically	
determined	
period	
of	
the	
cir-	
cadian	
clock	
in	
humans	ORGANISM
is	
on	
average	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

A	
circadian	
period	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
is	
associated	
with	
a	
circadian	
drive	
or	
physiological	
tendency	
for	
bed	
and	
wake	
times	
to	
be	
later	
,	
thus	
making	
it	
easier	
to	
shift	
the	
circadian	
clock	
during	
west-	
ward	
travel	
to	
more	
delayed	
sleep	
and	
wake	
times	
.	

However	
,	
20	
%	
to	
25

of	
humans	ORGANISM
have	
circadian	
periods	
that	
are	
near

shorter	
than

24

,	
and	
these

may

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Jet	
lag	
is	
usually	
a	
temporary	
condition	
.	

Symptoms	
begin	
approximately	
one	
to	
two	
days	
after	
air	
travel	
across	
at	
least	
two	
time	
zones	
and	
are	
self	
-	
limited	
.	

The	
severity	
and	
duration	
of	
symptoms	
are	
usually	
in	
proportion	
to	
the	
number	
of	
time	
zones	
trav-	
eled	
and	
the	
direction	
of	
travel	
.	

It	
is	
estimated	
that	
it	
takes	
one	
day	
per	
time	
zone	
for	
circadian	
rhythms	
to	
adjust	
to	
the	
local	
time	
.	

However	
,	
if	
traveling	
more	
than	
six	
time	
zones	
,	
circadian	
rhythms	
may	
shift	
in	
the	
opposite	
direction	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
prolonged	
period	
of	
adjustment	
that	
may	
last	
up	
to	
several	
weeks	
and	
increased	
severity	
of	
jet	
-	
lag	
symptoms	
.	

Exposure	
to	
light	
at	
inappropriate	
times	
may	
prolong	
the	
time	
of

ment	
by

is	
unknown

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
symptoms	
of	
jet	
lag	
disorder	
are	
due	
to	
both	
desynchronization	
of	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythms	
with	
local	
time	
and	
sleep	
disturbance	
.	

The	
severity	
of	
symptoms	
can	
be	
influenced	
by	
the	
environment	
and	
behaviors	
of	
the	
traveler	
.	

Factors	
inherent	
to	
jet	
travel	
,	
including	
prolonged	
time	
spent	
sitting	
in	
a	
confined	
space	
,	
ability	
to	
sleep	
on	
long	
-	
haul	
flights	
,	
decreased	
physical	
activity	
,	
and	
a	
low

Differential	
Diagnosis	
A	
thorough	
history	
and	
physical	
examination	
should	
be	
performed	
to	
exclude	
other	
mental	
,	
physical	
,	
or	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

Somatic

may	
indicate	
an	
underlying	
medical	
condition	
.	

When

lag	
symptoms	
persist	
,	
increas-	
ing	
frustration	
,	
negative	
expectations	
,	
and	
poor

hygiene	
may	
predispose	
the	
indi-

to	
the	
development	
of	
chronic

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
Understanding	
mechanisms	
of	
individual	
differences	
in	
vulnerability	
and	
tolerance	
to	
disturbed	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
during

three	
states	
are	
modulated	
by	
a	
host	
of	
influences	
including	
the	
degree	
of	
ami-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
nergic	
and	
cholinergic	TISSUE
neurochemical	TISSUE
bias	
,	
central	
nervous	
system	
(	
CNS	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
)	
activation	
,	
Parasomnias	
and	
the	
degree	
of	
endogenous	
versus	
exogenous	
input	
.	

Under	
normal	
physiologic	
conditions	
,	
which	
include	
homeostatic	
drive	
and	
circadian	
rhythmicity	
,	
the	
process	
of	
state	
declaration	
is	
maintained	
in	
a	
stable	
and	
predictable	
fashion	
throughout	
a	
24	
-	
hour	
period	
.	

However	
,	
as	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
oscillates	
,	
the	
normally	
distinct	
states	
of	
con-	
sciousness	
may	
be	
rendered	
into	
a	
state	
that	
is	
not	
fully	
declared	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
tempo-	CANCER
rary	
unstable	
state	
of	
dissociation	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
and	
wake	
can	
be	
viewed	
as	
occurring	
on	
a	
spectrum	
rather	
than	
being	
entirely	
dichotomous	
states	
.	

Parasomnias	
are	
the	
result	
of	
such	
state	
dissociation	
.	

Recent	
research	
has	
shown	
that	
com-	ORGAN
binations	
of	
one	
or	
more	
of	
these	
states	
do	
occur	
and	
may	
result	
in	
unstable	
states	
of	
altered	
consciousness	
manifesting	
as	
parasomnias	
.	

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
such	
as	
sleepwalking	
,	
sleep	
terrors	
,	
and	
confusional	
arousals	
are	
an	
admixture	
of	
wakefulness	
and	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

Higher	
cognitive	
function	
is	
severely	
impaired	
,	
if	
not	
absent	
,	
while	
the	
potential	
for	
motor	
capacity	
has	
,	
for	
the	
most	
part	
,	
been	
retained	
.	

REM	
sleep	
behavior	
disorder	
(	
RBD	
)	
is	
an	
admixture	
of	
REM	
sleep	
coupled	
with	
waking	
or	
NREM	
sleep	
levels	
of	
tonic	
EMG	CANCER
activity	
.	

All	
three	
states	
may	
be	
present	
in	
the	
same	
individual	
as	
an	
overlap	
of	
disorders	
.	

The	
comingling	
of	
basic	
states	
of	
consciousness	
is	
the	
result	
of	
different	
forms	
of	
pathophysiology	
.	

In	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
no	
identifiable	
neuropathology	
is	
present	
,	
but	
functional	
changes	
in	
cerebral	ORGAN
activity	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
are	
present	
,	
essentially	
resulting	
in	
a	
brain	ORGAN
in	
which	
certain	
areas	
are	
deactivated	
(	
asleep	
)	
and	
others	
remain	
activated	
(	
awake	
)	
.	

This	
CNS	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
activation	
,	
with	
concomitant	
skeletal	
muscle	
and	
auto-	
nomic	
nervous	
system	
activation	
,	
is	
believed	
to	
reflect	
a	
functional	
disabling	
of	
,	
or	
damage	
to	
,	
brain	ORGAN
areas	
usually	
responsible	
for	
the	
inhibition	
of	
these	
activities	
during	
sleep	
.	

Additionally	
,	
sleep	
inertia	
,	
sleep	
state	
instability	
,	
and	
locomotor	
/	
central	
pattern	
generators	
are	
thought	
to	
contribute	
to	
the	
occurrence	
of	
NREM	CANCER
parasomnias	
.	

NREM	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
frequently	
appear	
to	
involve	
the	
disinhibition	
of	
“	
basic	
drive	
states	
”	
such	
as	
feeding	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
aggression	
.	

Here	
,	
it	
has	
been	
postulated	
that	
central	
pattern	
generators	
elicit	
primal	
fixed	
action	
patterns	
that	
would	
otherwise	
have	
been	
inhibited	
by	
the	
prefrontal	CANCER
cortex	CANCER
during	
wake	
.	

In	
this	
regard	
,	
aggression	
is	
typ-	
ically	
abrupt	
in	
onset	
and	
characterized	
by	
apparent	
instinctual	
defensive	
posturing	
as	
opposed	
to	
behaviors	
that	
are	
complex	
and	
procedural	
.	

These	
can	
emerge	
in	
pathologic	
forms	
with	
the	
parasomnias	
,	
as	
seen	
with	
sleep	
related	
aggression	
and	
locomotion	
,	
sleep	
related	
eating	
disorder	
(	
SRED	
)	
,	
and	
abnormal	
sleep	
related	
sexual	
behaviors	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
RBD	
often	
results	
from	
serious	
neuropathology	
.	

Initially	
,	
this	
neuropathology	
affects	
the	
area	
of	
the	
brain	ORGAN
responsible	
for	
inhibiting	
muscle	ORGAN
tone	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
dreams	
may	
be	
enacted	
.	

In	
the	
case	
of	
REM	
-	
related	
behaviors	
,	
the	
experience	
and	
activity	
reflect	
the	
actual	
,	
often	
aggressive	
content	
of	
a	
dream	
.	

It	
is	
frequently	
pos-	
sible	
to	
correlate	
observed	
movements	
with	
later	
descriptions	
of	
the	
dream	
.	

The	
initial	
appearance	
of	
RBD	
symptoms	
is	
often	
followed	
years	
later	
by	
the	
development	
of	
neu-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
rodegenerative	
disorders	
,	
particularly	
Parkinson	CANCER
disease	CANCER
and	
related	
synucleinopathies	
.	

Abnormal	
sleep	
related	
movements	
comprise	
a	
separate	
category	
of	
disorders	
,	
which	
is	
detailed	
in	
the	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
section	
.	

Unlike	
the	
parasomnias	
,	
which	
typ-	
ically	
entail	
more	
complex	
movements	
and	
behavior	
,	
the	
movement	
disorders	
encompass	
a	
broad	
range	
of	
predominantly	
simple	
motoric	
activities	
:	
myoclonic	
,	
repetitive	
,	
rocking	
,	
rhythmic	
,	
grinding	
,	
cramping	
,	
fragmentary	
,	
dystonic	
,	
or	
dyskinetic	
movements	
or	
tremors	
,	
which	
are	
not	
usually	
associated	
with	
dream	
mentation	
or	
experiential	
concomitants	
.	

Parasomnias	
involve	
sleep	
related	
behaviors	
and	
experiences	
over	
which	
there	
is	
no	
conscious	
deliberate	
control	
.	

There	
are	
ten	
core	
categories	
of	
parasomnias	
listed	
in	
the	
International	
Classification	
of

criteria	
.	

However	
,	
for	
most	
of	
the	
other	
parasomnias	
,	
polysomnographic	
monitoring	
can	
provide	
corroborative	
documentation	
in	
support	
of	
the	
clinical	
diagnosis	
.	

Considerable	
advances	
have	
taken	
place	
in	
understanding	
the	
neurophysiologic	
aspects	
of	
abnormal	
arousals	
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
associated	
with	
the	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Advances	
in	
the	
clinical	
understanding	
of	
these	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
parasomnias	
have	
occurred	
as	
well	
,	
particularly	
in	
regard	
to	
their	
prevalence	
and	
severity	
in	
adults	
.	

In	
regard	
to	
RBD

Essential	
Features	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
consist	
of	
complex	
behaviors	
that	
are	
usually	
initiated	
during	
partial	
arousals	
from	
slow	
wave	
(	
N3	
)	
sleep	
.	

Most	
episodes	
are	
brief	
,	
but	
they	
may	
last	
as	
long	
as	
30	
to	
40	
minutes	
in	
some	
children	ORGANISM
.	

Sleep	
talking	
and	
shouting	
may	
accompany	
these	
events	
.	

The	
eyes	ORGAN
are	
usually	
open	
during	
an	
episode	
and	
,	
not	
uncom-	
monly	
,	
are	
wide	
open	
with	
a	
confused	
“	
glassy	
”	
stare	
.	

The	
patient	ORGANISM
with	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
may	
be	
very	
difficult	
to	
awaken	
and	
,	
when	
awakened	
,	
is	
often	
confused	
.	

There	
is	
usually	
amnesia	
for	
these	
episodes	
,	
although	
adults	
may	
remember	
fragments	
of	
episodes	
.	

Dream	
-	
like	
mentation	
is	
sometimes	
reported	
in	
adults	
.	

Other	
high	
-	
level	
cog-	
nitive	
functions	
such	
as	
attention	
,	
planning	
,	
social	
interaction	
,	
and	
intent	
are	
absent	
.	

Because	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
usually	
originate	
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
,	
they	
most	
often	
emerge	
in	
the	
first	
third	
or	
first	
half	
of	
the	
typical	
sleep	
period	
.	

They	
may	
occur	
during	
other	
times	
of	
increased	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
,	
such	
as	
during	
recovery	
sleep	
following	
sleep	
deprivation	
.	

They	
rarely	
arise	
from	
a	
daytime	
nap	
.	

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
are	
encountered	
most	
commonly	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
typically	
resolve	
by	
puberty	
but	
may	
persist	
(	
or	
,	
infrequently	
,	
arise	
de	
novo	
)	
in	
adolescence	
or	
adulthood	
.	

Confusional	
Arousals	
:	
Confusional	
arousals	
,	
unlike	
sleepwalking	
,	
occur	
with	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
in	
bed	
.	

When	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
leaves	ORGANISM
the	
bed	
,	
sleepwalking	
has	
been	
initiated	
.	

Confusional	
arousals	
often	
start	
with	
the	
individual	
sitting	
up	
in	
bed	
and	
looking	
about	
in	
a	
confused	
manner	
.

episodes	
can	
also	
begin	
with	
the	
individual	
immediately	
leaving	
the	
bed	
and	
walking	
or	
even	
“	
bolting	
”	
from	
the	
bed	
and	
running	
.	

Highly	
inappropriate	
,	
agitated	
,	
resistive	
,	
belligerent	
,	
or	
violent	
behavior	
can	
also	
occur	
.	

Behaviors	
can	
be	
simple	
and	
non	
–	
goal	
-	
directed	
,	
or	
complex	
and	
protracted	
,	
and	
may	
involve	
inappro-	
priate	
sexual	
activity	
with	
oneself	
or	
an	
individual	
in	
close	
proximity	
such	
as	
a	
bed	
partner	
.	

The	
ambulation	
may	
terminate	
spontaneously	
,	
at	
times	
in	
inappropriate	
places	
,	
or	
the	
sleepwalker	
may	
return	
to	
bed	
,	
lie	
down	
,	
and	
continue	
to	
sleep	
without	
reach-	
ing	
conscious	
awareness	
at	
any	
point	
.	

The	
sleepwalking	
individual	
is	
disoriented	
in	
time	
and	
place	
,	
with	
slow	
speech	
,	
with	
severely	
diminished	
mentation	
,	
and	
blunted	
response	
to	
questions	
or	
requests	
.	

There	
is	
often	
prominent	
anterograde	
and	
retrograde	
memory	
impairment	
.	

Despite	
diminished	
external	
perception	
as	
a	
result	
of	
blockade	
of	
sensory	
input	
,	
the	
individual	
may	
appear	
to	
be	
awake	
during	
some	
or	
most	
of	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
with	
reduced	
vigilance	
and	
impaired	
cognitive	
response	
.	

Sleep	
Terrors	
:	
Sleep	
terrors	
differ	
from	
other	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
in	
that	
the	
events	
are	
often	
accompanied	
by	
a	
cry	
or	
piercing	
scream	
,	
accompanied	
by	
autonomic	CANCER
nervous	CANCER
system	CANCER
and	
behavioral	
manifestations	
of	
intense	
fear	
.	

There	
is	
often	
intense	
autonomic	
discharge	
,	
with	
tachycardia	
,	
tachypnea	
,	
flushing	
of	
the	
skin	ORGAN
,	
diaphoresis	
,	
mydriasis	
,	
and	
increased	
muscle	ORGAN
tone	
.	

The	
person	
usually	
sits	
up	
in	
bed	
;	
is	
unresponsive	
to	
exter-	
nal	
stimuli	
;	
and	
,	
if	
awakened	
,	
is	
confused	
and	
disoriented	
.	

However	
,	
bolting	
out	
of	
bed	
and	
running	
is	
not	
uncommon	
in	
adults	
and	
also	
can	
be	
associated	
with	
violent	
behav-	
iors	
,	
particularly	
if	
attempts	
are	
made	
to	
block	
or	
restrain	
the	
individual	
.	

The	
sleep	
terror	
episode	
may	
be	
accompanied	
by	
incoherent	
vocalizations	
.	

Sometimes	
there	
is	
prolonged	
inconsolability	
associated	
with	
a	
sleep	
terror	
in	
children	ORGANISM
or	
adults	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
are	
devoid	
of	
higher	
cognitive	
functions	
such	
as	
planning	
,	
memory	
from	
before	
an	
incident	
,	
formation	
of	
a	
memory	
during	
an	
incident	
,	
true	
social	
inter-	
action	
,	
or	
recognition	
of	
others	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
exhibiting	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
are	
not	
con-	
sciously	
aware	
and	
behaviors	
are	
often	
thought	
to	
be	
“	
automatic	
”	
in	
nature

injury	
may	
occur	
as	
well	
as

close	
proximity

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
in	
particular	
sleepwalking	
,	
can	
involve	
normal	
,	
routine	
behav-	
iors	
that	
are	
inappropriate	
only	
in	
regard	
to	
their	
timing	
.	

More	
often	
,	
however	
,	
sleep-	
walking	
involves	
inappropriate	
behaviors	
,	
such	
as	
urinating	
in	
a	
wastebasket	
,	
moving	
furniture	
around	
haphazardly	
,	
or	
climbing	
out	
a	
window	
.	

Sleepwalkers	
are	
sometimes	
able	
to	
navigate	
in	
familiar	
surroundings	
,	
but	
are	
prone	
to	
bumping	
into	
objects	
or	
falling	
down	
.	

A	
sudden	
arousal	
consistent	
with	
sleep	
terrors	
may	
segue	
rapidly	
into	
agitated	
sleepwalking	
and	
panicky	
running	
and	
other	
potentially	
dangerous	
behav-	
iors	
.	

Self

injury	
is	
not

.	

Violence	
to	
others	
also	
can	
occur	
with	
adult	
sleepwalking	
,	
especially	
in	
men	ORGANISM
.	

The	
sleepwalker	
does	
not	
generally	
seek	
out	
the	
eventual	
victim	
of	
violence	
.	

More	
typi-	

cally

a

to	
block	
,

,	
restrain	
,	
redirect	
or	
awaken	
a	
sleepwalker	
during	
an	
episode	
may	
be	
violently	
attacked	
,	
even	
if	
they	
are	
family	
members	
or	
friends	
.	

This	
may	
result	
in	
a	
form	
of	
primitive	
defensive	
aggression	
including	
pushing	
,	
hitting	
,	
kicking	
,	
or	
throwing	
objects	
.	

This	
pattern	
also	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
when	
technical	
personnel	
have	
attempted	
to	
return	
sleepwalking	
patients	ORGANISM
to

.	

In	
extreme	
cases	
,	
victims	
have	
been	
stabbed	
with

or	
blunt	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
objects	
.	

Such	
inappropriate	
and	
antisocial	
behaviors	
have	
legal	
and	
forensic	
implications

have	
been

with	
calm	
sleepwalking	
may	
quietly	
walk	
toward	
a	
light	
or

Occasionally	
,	
children	ORGANISM
will	
walk

even	
go	
outside

with	
obvious

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
are	
most	
often	
evaluated	
in	
terms	
of	
predisposing	
,	
priming	
,	
and	
precipitating	
(	
triggering	
)	
factors	
.	

Most	
often	
a	
simultaneous	
co	
-	
occurrence	
of	
these	
factors	
is	
thought	
necessary	
in	
order	
for	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
occur	
.	

However	
,	
the	
reason	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
occurs	
on	
one	
night	
and	
not	
others	
is	
not	
fully	
understood	
.	

A	
genetic	
predisposition	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
and	
several	
studies	
have	
identified	
dif-	
ferent	
genetic	
loci	
and	
modes	
of	
inheritance	
(	
see	
Familial	
Pattern	
,	
below	
)	
.	

In	
childhood	
,	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
can	
usually	
be	
considered	
an	
expected	
and	
normal	
developmental	
sleep	
phenomenon	
,	
apart	
from	
those	
cases	
with	
clinical	
consequences	
.	

However	
,	
dis-	
orders	
of	
arousal	
that	
persist	
beyond	
adolescence	
or	
begin	
in	
adulthood	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
can	
often	
be	
problematic	
and	
may	
require	
clinical	
attention

Parasomnias

Many	
priming	
factors	
for	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
in	
particular	
sleepwalking	
,	
have	
been	
identified	
.	

Sleep	
deprivation	
and	
situational	
stress	
are	
the	
most	
potent	
factors

as	
potential	
priming	
factors	
.	

OSA	
and	
other	
sleep	
related	
respiratory	
events	
are	
increasingly	
recognized	
precipitants	
of	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
in	
both	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adults

Treatment	
of	
these	
comorbid	
con-	
ditions	
may	
reduce	
or	
eliminate	
the	
occurrence	
of	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
may	
also	
be	
triggered	
by	
environmental	
stimuli	
such	
as	
telephone	
calls	
,	
pagers	
,	
messaging	
from	
electronic	
devices	
,	
and	
a	
host	
of	
other	
stimuli

It	
is	
clinically	
important	
to	
note	
that	
first	
responders	
,	
physicians	
,	
and	
others	
on	
call	
may	
be	
vulnerable	
to	
such	
stimuli

the	
potential

inappropriate	
responses

Alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
has	
been	
identified	
in

However	
,	
the

Genetic

Sleepwalking	
has	
a

and	
autosomal	
dominant	
trait	
with	
reduced	
penetrance	
have	
been	
proposed	
,	
based	
primarily	
on	
analysis	
of	
family	
histories	
.	

However	
,	
these	
finding	
are	
not	
sufficiently	
specific	
to	
be	
used	
for	
diagnostic	
testing	
.	

Further	
,	
the	
mechanisms	
by	
which	
a	
genetic	
predisposition	
for	
confusional	
arousal	
or	
other	
related	
disorders	
contributes	
to	
their	
occurrence	
are	
not	
known	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Confusional	
arousals	
most	
often	
appear	
in	
early	
childhood	
around	
the	
age	
of	
two	
years	
.	

This	
childhood	
form	
of	
confusional	
arousals	
is	
typically	
benign	CANCER
,	
but	
may	
cause	
concern	
in	
parents	
.	

Confusional	
arousals	
of	
early	
childhood	
diminish	
in	
occurrence	
after	
the	
age	
of	
five	
years	
.	

Sleepwalking	
can	
begin	
as	
soon	
as	
a	
child	
is	
able	
to	
walk	
but	
may	
begin	
at	
almost	
any	
time	
in	
the	
life	
cycle	
,	
including	
as	
late	
as	
the	
seventh	
decade	
.	

Sleepwalking	
is	
often	
preceded	
by	
confusional	
arousals	
.	

Childhood	
sleepwalking	
usually	
disappears	
sponta-	
neously	
around	
puberty	
but	
may	
persist	
into	
adolescence	
.	

Episodes	
can	
occur	
sporad-	
ically	
or	
with	
high	
frequency	
,	
such	
as	
multiple	
times	
nightly	
for	
several	
consecutive	
nights	
.	

Sleepwalking	
may	
occur	
for	
the	
first	
time	
in	
adulthood	
or	
may	
recur	
in	
adult-	
hood	
during	
periods	
of	
sleep	
deprivation	
or	
stress	
.	

Sleep	
terrors	
usually	
emerge	
in	
children	ORGANISM
aged	
four	
to	
12	
years	
(	
but	
can	
also	
emerge	
in	
adulthood	
)	
and	
tend	
to	
resolve	
spontaneously	
by	
early	
adolescence	
,	
as	
does	
sleep-	
walking	
.	

Social	
embarrassment	
over	
the	
sleep	
terrors	
can	
impair	
social	
relationships	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adults	
.	

Serious	
or	
even	
lethal	
injuries	
can	
occur	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
noted	
above	
,	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
most	
often	
occur	
initially	
in	
childhood	
and	
decrease	
in	
occurrence	
steadily	
until	
young	
adulthood	
.	

However	
,	
they	
may	
occur	
for	
the	
first	
time	
in	
adulthood	
or	
reappear	
after	
many	
asymptomatic	
years	
,	
often	
related	
to	
stress	
,	
sleep	
deprivation	
,	
or	
development	
of	
another	
sleep	
disorder	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
overwhelming	
majority	
of	
individuals	
with	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
do	
not	
have	
neuro-	
logical	
or	
psychological	
pathology	
.	

There	
are	
rare	
reported	
cases	
of	
confusional	
arous-	
als	
associated	
with	
brain	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
lesions	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
in	
areas	
subserving	
arousal	
,	
such	
as	
the	
posterior	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
hypothalamus	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
,	
midbrain	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
reticular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
area	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
,	
and	
periventricular	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
gray	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
matter	
.	

However	
,	
data	
from	
a	
single	
patient	ORGANISM
with	
confusional	
arousals	
suggest	
that	
they	
may	
be	
due	
to	
a	
func-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
tional	
abnormality	
in	
the	
brain	ORGAN
that	
leaves	TISSUE
some	
regions	
,	
such	
as	
hippocampus	
and	
Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
frontal	
associative	
cortices	
,	
asleep	
,	
while	
other	
parts	
of	
the	
brain	ORGAN
such	
as	
motor	
,	
cingu-	
late	
,	
insular	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
amygdala	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
and	
temporopolar	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
cortices	
,	
are	
active	
or	
awake	
.	

It	
is	
generally	
considered	
that	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
represent	
a	
dissociation	
of	
different	
regions	
of	
the	
brain	ORGAN
in	
addition	
to	
activation	
of

and

.	

Objective	
Findings	

Although	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
for	
the	
evaluation	
of	
typical	
,	
uncomplicated	
,	
and	
non-	
injurious	
parasomnias	
,	
polysomnographic	
studies	
demonstrate	
that	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
typically	
begin	
after	
an	
arousal	
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
,	
most	
commonly	
toward	
the	
end	
of	
the	
first	
or	
second	
episode	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

Occasionally	
,	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
can	
emerge	
from	
stage	
N2	
sleep	
.	

Heart	ORGAN
rate	
acceleration	
,	
increased	
muscle	ORGAN
tone	
,	
and	
muscle	ORGAN
twitching	
may	
rarely	
be	
observed	
before	
a	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
arousal	
.	

Diagnostic	
polysomnography	
may	
note	
high	
-	
amplitude	
hypersynchronous	
delta	
waves	
and	
frequent	
arousals	
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
these	
findings	
have	
a	
low	
spec-	
ificity	
and	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
occur	
in	
other	
disorders	
such	
as	
OSA	
and	
in	
asymp-	
tomatic	
individuals	
.	

On	
rare	
occasions	
,	
polysomnography	
can	
provide	
support	
for	
the	
clinical	
diagnosis	
by	
documenting	
arousals	
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
accompanied	
by	
behaviors	
typical	
of	
confusional	
arousals	
.	

Out	
-	
of	
-	
bed	
behaviors	
are	
very	
rare	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
.	

Changes	
between	
the	
home	
and	
sleep	
laboratory	
environment	
,	
timing	
,	
habits	
,	
and	
other	
factors	
may	
serve	
to	
decrease	
the	
likelihood	
of	
sleepwalking	
in	
the	
laboratory	
.	

Time	
-	
synchronized	
video	
-	
polysomnographic	
(	
vPSG	
)	
recording	
is	
essen-	
tial	
if	
polysomnography	
(	
PSG	
)	
is	
to	
be	
used	
as	
support	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

However	
,	
a	
normal	
PSG	
does	
not	
rule	
out	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
.	

In	
adults	
in	
whom	
there	
are	
only	
one	
or	
two	
episodes	
per	
year	
,	
there	
is	
a	
very	
low	
likelihood	
of	
occurrence	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
.	

However	
,	
the	
sleep	
study	
may	
assist	
in	
ruling	
out	
disorders	
with	
similar	
presentations	
,	
such	
as	
RBD	
or	
nocturnal	
epilepsy	
.	

PSG	
may	
further	
be	
useful	
by	
identifying	
potential	
triggers	
,	
such	
as	
sleep	
related	
breathing	
disorder	
or	
peri-	
odic	
leg	ORGAN
movements	
that	
are	
currently	
present	
.	

Provocative	
sleep	
studies	
using	
sleep	
deprivation	
and	
acoustic	
stimuli	
have	
been	
used	
for	
research	
purposes	
,	
with	
success	
.	

However	
,	
the	
sensitivity	
and	
specificity	
of	
these	
techniques	
for	
clinical	
purposes	
are	
unknown	
.	

Postarousal

.	

PSG	
also	
may	
be	
helpful	
in	
excluding	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
RBD	
by	
demonstration	
of	
normal	
muscle	ORGAN
atonia	
in	
REM	
sleep	
(	
assuming	
adequate	
amounts	
of	
REM	
sleep	
are	
observed	
)	
.	

Although	
the	
“	
macrostructure	
”	
of	
sleep	
(	
i.e.	
,	
the	
cycling	
of	
various	
NREM	
and	
REM	
sleep	
stages	
and	
the	
relative	
distributions	
of	
these	
sleep	
stages	
)	
is	
generally	
preserved	
with	
sleepwalking	
,	
the	
“	
microstructure	
”	
of	
sleep	
can	
be	
perturbed	
.	

Power	
spectral	
analyses	
of	
slow	
wave	
activity	
in	
adult	
sleepwalkers	
have	
revealed	
several	
forms	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
dysregulation	
,	
including	
high	
amounts	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
fragmentation	
(	
particularly	
during	
the	
first	
NREM	
-	
REM	
sleep	
cycle	
)	
,	
a	
significant	
increase	
in	
delta	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
power	
just	
prior	
to	
an	
arousal	
,	
and	
increased

activity	
across	
all	
NREM	
sleep	
cycles	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
should	
be	
carefully	
distinguished	
from	
other	
disorders	
with	
similar	
presentations	
,	
but	
different	
pathophysiologies	
,	
courses	
,	
and	
treatments	
.	

Other	
disorders	
to	
be	
considered	
include	
RBD	
,	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	
,	
sleep	
related	
dissocia-	
tive	
disorders	
,	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
drug	
related	
behaviors	
,	
and	
OSA	
.	

RBD	
typically	
presents	
as	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
during	
the	
second	
half	
of	
the	
night	
and	
usually	
affects	
middle	
-	
aged	
men	ORGANISM
,	
but	
also	
can	
affect	
women	ORGANISM
and	
virtually	
any	
age	
group	
.	

Because	
sleepwalking	
in	
adults	
can	
also	
present	
as	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
that	
emerge	
during	
any	
time	
of	
the	
night	
,	
vPSG	
may	
be	
necessary	
to	
distinguish	
sleep-	
walking	
from	
RBD	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
signs	
of	
RBD	
,	
particularly	
tonic	
/	
phasic	
EMG	
activity	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
are	
almost	
always	
present	
during	
sleep	
studies	
.	

If	
sleepwalking	
(	
or	
sleep	
terrors	
)	
occurs	
with	
RBD	
in	
the	
same	
patient	ORGANISM
,	
both	
should	
be	
diagnosed	
.	

This	
has	
been	
referred	
to	
as	
a	
parasomnia	
overlap	
disorder	
.	

Other	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
such	
as	
OSA	
,	
can	
precipitate	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Therefore	
,	
a	
careful	
history	
must	
be	
obtained	
to	
identify	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

Sleep	
related	
epilepsy	
can	
manifest	
with	
wandering	
behavior	
or	
with	
frenzied	
walking	
or	
running	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
malingering	
also	
should	
be	
considered	
.	

If	
a	
neurologic	
or	
medical	
disor-	
der	
is	
identified	
as	
the	
precipitant	
of	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
,	
then	
the	
sleepwalking	
should	
be	
diagnosed	
as	
parasomnia	
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disorder	
.	

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
should	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
in	
the	
presence	
of	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
intoxication	
.	

The	
behavior	
of	
the	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
-	
intoxicated	
individual	
may	
superficially	
resemble	
that	
of	
the	
sleepwalker	
.	

However	
,	
the	
sleepwalker	
is	
typically	
severely	
cognitively	
impaired	
,	
but	
with	
only	
limited	
motor	
impairment	
.	

The	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
-	
intoxicated	
individual	
’s	
level	
of	
cognitive	
functioning	
may	
be	
reduced	
,	
but	
not	
absent	
,	
whereas	
motor	
behavior	
is	
often	
severely	
impaired	
.	

In	
alcoholic	
blackouts	
,	
where	
anterograde	
amnesia	
is	
,	
by	
definition	
,	
Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
the	
cardinal	
manifestation	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
note	
that	
outward	
motor	
behavior	
and	
cog-	
nitive	
function	
may	
not	
be	
impaired	
and	
may	
be	
perceived	
as	
normal	
.	

Thus	
,	
the	
impor-	
tance	
of	
appreciating	
the	
neuroscience	
of	
alcoholic	
blackouts	
and	
its	
potential	
role	
in	
the	
explanation	
of	
unusual	
and	
bizarre	
nocturnal	
behaviors	
can	
not	
be	
understated	
because	
these	
can	
mimic	
parasomnias	
.	

The	
former	
are	
exponentially	
more	
prevalent	
and	
thus	
should	
be	
given	
appropriate	
weight	
when	
attributing	
likely	
causation	
in	
cases	
with	
criminal	
allegations	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
With	
the	
development	
of	
sophisticated	
genetic	
testing	
and	
neuroimaging	
,	
direct	
research	
into	
the	
causes	
and	
mechanisms	
of	
disorders	
or	
arousals	
is	
anticipated	
.	

Further	
investigations	
that	
aid	
in	
the	
characterization	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
are	
necessary	
.	

Further	
development	
of	
sleep	
laboratory	
-	
based	
techniques	
for	
provoking	
episodes	
of	
sleepwalking	
would	
improve	
diagnostic	
accuracy	
.

Essential	
Features	
SRED	
consists	
of	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
involuntary	
eating	
and	
drinking	
during	
arous-	
als	
from	
sleep	
,	
associated	
with	
diminished	
levels	
of	
consciousness	
and	
subsequent	
recall	
,	
with	
problematic	
consequences	
.	

The	
episodes	
of	
eating	
always	
occur	
in	
an	
involuntary	
or	
“	
out	
of	
control	
”	
manner	
after	
an	
interval	
of	
sleep	
.	

Typically	
,	
they	
occur	
during	
partial	
arousals	
from	
sleep	
with	
subsequent	
partial	
recall	
.	

On	
the	
one	
hand	
,	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
can	
not	
be	
easily	
brought	
to	
full	
consciousness	
during	
an	
episode	
of	
eating	
,	
as	
is	
the	
case	
with	
sleepwalking	
,	
and	
may	
have	
no	
recall	
of	
having	
eaten	
during	
the	
night	
.	

On	
the	
other	
hand	
,	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
seemingly	
have	
considerable	
alertness	
during	
an	
episode	
and	
have	
substantial	
recall	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

There	
may	
be	
variability	
of	
awareness	
and	
subsequent	
recall	
within	
one	
night	
,	
and	
across	
the	
evolution	
of	
the	
disorder	
in	
individual	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

The	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
involuntary	
eating	
and	
drinking	
during	
the	
main	
sleep	
period	
are	
typically	
associated	
with	
a	
feeling	
of	
lack	
of	
control	
over	
eating	
.	

Problematic	
features	
of	
the	
recurrent	
sleep	
related	
eating	
include	
the	
following	
:	
con-	
sumption	
of	
peculiar	
forms	
or	
combinations	
of	
food	
,	
or	
of	
inedible	
or

SRED	
carries	
the

disorders	
may	
emerge	
from	
longstanding	
personal	
dejection	
and	
a	
sense	
of	
failure	
over	
the

to	
control	
the	
nocturnal

,	
prompted	
by	
despair	
over	
not

to	
stop	
the	
nocturnal	
eating

often	
occurs	
at	
some	
point	
during	
the	
course

Demographics	
The

rates	
of	
SRED	
,	
as	
determined	
by	
self

administered	
questionnaire	
,	
have	
been	
reported	
:	
16.7

outpatient

group	
;	
and	
4.6	
%	
in	
an	
unselected	
university	
student	
group	
.	

This	
study	
would	
indicate	
a	
high	
prevalence	
of	
SRED	
,	
although	
confirmatory	
studies	
across	
Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
different	
clinical

Females	
comprise	
60	
%	
to	
83	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
in	
reported	
series	
.	

Mean	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
SRED	
is	
reported	
to	
be	
22	
-	
39	
years	
.	

In	
the	
reported	
series	
,	
the	
mean	
duration	
of	
SRED	
prior	
to	
clinical	
presen-	
tation	
ranged	
from	
four	
to	
15	
years	
,	
suggesting	
that	
SRED	
often	
is	
a	
chronic	
disorder	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
SRED	
can	
be	
idiopathic	
,	
but	
it	
appears	
to	
be	
most	
commonly	
associated	
with	
a	
primary	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
another	
clinical	
condition	
,	
or	
use	
of	
a	
sedative	
-	
hypnotic	
medication	
.	

Sleepwalking	
is	
the	
most	
common	
sleep	
disorder	
associated	
with	
sleep	
related	
eating	
,	
although	
once	
eating	
becomes	
part	
of	
the	
behavioral	
repertoire	
,	
it	
quickly	
becomes	
the	
predominant	
,	
if	
not	
the	
exclusive	
,	
nocturnal	
“	
sleepwalking	
”	
behavior	
.	

This	
would	
indi-	ORGAN
cate	ORGAN
that	
SRED	
is	
most	
often	
a	
“	
sleepwalking	
variant	
disorder	
.	
”	

A	
history	
of	
sleepwalk-	
ing	
during	
childhood	
appears	
to	
be	
a	
predisposing	
factor	
in	
many	
cases	
.	

A	
recent	
retro-	ORGANISM
spective	
controlled	
study	
of	
SRED	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
sleepwalking	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
and	
controls	
found	
that	
SRED	
patients	ORGANISM
were	
mainly	
women	ORGANISM
with	
onset	
of	
the	
disturbance	
in	
adulthood	
.	

They	
typically	
experienced	
nightly	
episodes	
and	
had	
more	
frequent	
eating	
problems	
in	
childhood	
and	
higher	
current	
anorexia	
scores	
than	
sleepwalking	
patients	ORGANISM
or	
controls	
.	

They	
also	
shared	
commonalities	
with	
sleepwalking	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
including	
a	
high	
(	
66	
%	
)	
frequency	
of	
past	
or	
current	
sleepwalking	
,	
a	
similar	
timing	
of	
parasomnia	
episodes	
(	
in	
the	
first	
half	
of	
the	
night	
)	
,	
and	
numerous	
arousals	
from	
stage	
N3	
.	

On	
video	
-	
polysom-	
nography	
,	
eating	
episodes	
occurred	
mostly	
within	
one	
minute	
after	
awakening	
from	
stage	
N2	
or	
N3	
.	

The	
frequencies	
of	
RLS	
,	
PLMs	CANCER
,	
and	
sleep

were	
similar	
across	
the	
three	
groups

that	
can	
be	
closely

have	
been	
reported	
with

,	
including

has	
been	
reported

with

of	
narcolepsy	
,

SRED	
can	
also	
be	
associated	
with	
daytime	
eating	
disorders	
,	
and	
with	
nocturnal	
dissocia-

disorder	
.	

In	
a

who	
were	
systematically

Complications	
The	
onset	
of	
SRED	
can	
be	
insidious	
and	
sporadic	
,	
or	
it	
can	
be	
precipitous	
and	
fulmi-	
nant	
with	
rapid	
development	
of	
nightly	
episodes	
of	
eating	
,	
related	
or	
unrelated	
to	
the	
start	
of	
hypnotic	
medication	
therapy	
of	
insomnia	
.	

The	
course	
is	
usually	
unremitting	
.	

Fires	
can	
occur	
when	
the	
individual	
with	
SRED	
begins	
to	
cook	
foods	
on	
the	
stove	
or	
in	
the	
oven	
,	
and	
then	
abandons	
them	
.	

A	
variety	
of	
other	
complications	
have	
been	
described	
previously	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
SRED	
can	
emerge	
in	
childhood	
,	
either	
associated	
or	
unassociated	
with	
a	
family	
history	
of	
SRED	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
SRED	
is	
unclear	
.	

Despite	
the	
broad	
range	
of	
pre-	
disposing	
and	
precipitating	
factors	
in	
SRED	
,	
the	
relatively	
homogeneous	
set	
of	
clinical	
features	
suggests	
the	
presence	
of	
a	
“	
final	
common	
pathway	
”	
that	
can	
be	
accessed	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
factors	
.	

Although	
SRED	
has	
prominent	
features	
of	
both	
a	
sleep	
disorder	
and	
an	
eating	
disorder	
,	
its	
relatively	
homogeneous	
presentation	
supports	
its	
classification	
as	
a	
separate	
diagnostic	
entity	
.	

More	
than	
half	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
SRED	
have	
a	
history	
of	
another	
parasomnia	
that	
preceded	
the	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
eating	
,	
suggesting	
that	
the	
presence	
of	
another	
parasomnia	
is	
a	
major	
risk	
factor	
for	
SRED	
.	

However	
,	
the	
female	ORGANISM
predominance	
in	
SRED	
is	
more	
consistent	
with	
eating	
disorders	
,	
which	
are	
female	
pre-	
dominant	
,	
than	
with	
sleepwalking	
or	
movement	
disorders	
(	
RLS	
/	
PLMD	
)	
which	
have	
slight	
to	
no	
female	ORGANISM
bias	
.	

Thus	
it	
appears	
that	
two	
basic	
drive	
states	
—	
sleeping	
and	
eating	
—	
are	
pathologically	
intertwined	
in	
SRED	
.	

Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
Objective	
Findings	
Although	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
in	
the	
assessment	
of	
SRED	
,	
vPSG	
evaluations	
have	
often	
reported	
positive	
findings	
.	

The	
most	
common	
finding	
consists	
of	
multiple	
confu-	
sional	
arousals	
,	
with	
or	
without	
eating	
,	
arising	
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
abnor-	AMINO_ACID
mal	AMINO_ACID
arousals	AMINO_ACID
have	AMINO_ACID
been	AMINO_ACID
documented	
from	
all	
stages	
of	
NREM	
sleep	
and	
also	
occasion-	
ally	
from	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
level	
of	
consciousness	
has	
typically	
spanned	
the	
range	
from	
virtual	
unconsciousness	
to	
various	
levels	
of	
partial	
consciousness	
despite	
a	
concurrent	
EEG	
pattern	
that	
is	
often	
predominantly	
awake	
,	
suggesting	
dissociation	
between	
the	
EEG	
and	
the	
level	
of	
consciousness	
.	

This	
dissociation	
also	
can	
be	
found	
in	
adult	
sleep-	
walking	
without	
associated	
eating	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
classic	
sleepwalking	
in	
childhood	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
the	
persistence	
of	
high	
-	
voltage	
delta	
waves	
or	
the	
admixture	
of	
delta	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
theta	
,	
and	
alpha	
activity	
.	

A	
predominant	
wake	
pattern	
is	
rare	
in	
childhood	
sleep-	
walking	
.	

PLMs	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
and	
OSA	
may	
be	
observed	
in	
polysomnographic	
monitoring	
of	
SRED	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

In	
one	
recent	
study	
that	
addressed	
the	
boundaries	
between	
SRED	
and	
fully	
conscious	
abnormal	
nocturnal	
eating	
,	
22	
of	
35	
patients	ORGANISM
had	
PLMs	CANCER
,	
5	
of	
35	
had	
RLS	
,	
and	
29	
of	
35	
had	
recurring	
chewing	
and	
swallowing	
movements	
during	
sleep	
that	
were	
associated	
with	
nearly	
half	
of	
the	
total	
number	
of	
EEG	
arousals	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
SRED	
must	
be	
distinguished	
primarily	
from	
night	
eating	
syndrome	
(	
NES	
)	
,	
which	
is	
characterized	
by	
excessive	
eating	
between	
dinner	
and	
bedtime	
and	
during	
full	
awaken-	
ings	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
during	
the	
sleep	
period	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
daytime	
eating	
disorders	
(	
bulimia	
nervosa	
,	
anorexia	
nervosa	
)	
,	
inappropriate	
compensatory	
behavior	
,	
such	
as	
self	
-	
induced	
vom-	
iting	
,	
enemas	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
misuse	
of	
laxatives	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
diuretics	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
or	
other	
medications	
,	
or	
other	
purging	
activity	
,	
are	
not	
present	
in	
SRED	
,	
although	
the	
two	
conditions	
may	
be	
comorbid	
.	

A	
person	
with	
a	
daytime	
eating	
disorder	
may	
also	
have	
a	
coexisting	
SRED	
that	
is	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
confusional	
arousals	
but	
not	
associated	
with	
purging	
behaviors	
during	
the	
night	
or	
upon	
arising	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
longstanding	
SRED	
and	
excessive	
weight	
gain	
may	
eventually	
fast	
during	
the	
daytime	
and/or	
engage	
in	
excessive	
exer-	
cise	
to	
prevent	
obesity	
from	
the	
SRED	
.	

Likewise	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
otherwise	
fulfill	
crite-	
ria	
for	
SRED	
may	
consciously	
eat	
during	
the	
prebedtime	
period	
in	
a	
futile	
attempt	
to	
suppress	
the	
compulsion	
to	
eat	
after	
subsequently	
falling	
asleep	
.	

SRED	
appears	
to	
be	
considerably	
more	
female	ORGANISM
predominant	
that	
NES	
(	
which	
has	
<	
60	
%	
female	
prevalence	
)	
,	
and	
mood	
disorders	
are	
more	
common	
with	
NES	
than	
with	
SRED	
.	

Nevertheless	
,	
SRED	
and	
NES	
share	
a	
considerable	
number	
of	
overlapping	
features	
and	
may	
exist	
along	
a	
common	
spectrum	
of	
pathophysiology	
.	

SRED	
should	
also	
be	
distinguished	
from	
nocturnal	
(	
sleep	
related	
)	
extensions	
of	
bulimia	
nervosa	
,	
binge	
-	
eating	
disorder	
,	
and	
anorexia	
nervosa	
,	
binge	
/	
purge	
type	
.	

The	
nocturnal	
eating	
(	
drinking	
)	
syndrome	
described	
in	
the	
original	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
is	
primarily	
a	
disorder	
of	
infancy	
that	
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent	
awakenings	
with	
the	
inability	
to	
resume	
sleep	
without	
eating	
or	
drinking	
.	

Kleine	
-	
Levin	
syndrome	
(	
periodic	
hypersomnia	
)	
can	
present	
with	
inappropriate	
noctur-	
nal	
eating	
,	
but	
its	
predominance	
in	
adolescent	
males	
and	
its	
hallmark	
symptom	
complex	
of	
periodic	
hypersomnia	
,	
hypersexuality	
,	
and	
hyperphagia	
lasting	
days	
to	
weeks	
should	
easily	
distinguish	
it	
from	
SRED	
.	

Medical	
and	
neurologic	
disorders	
that	
could	
be	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
abnormal	
recurrent	
eating	
during	
the	
main	
sleep	
period	
(	
usually	
with	
full	
or	
almost	
full	
alertness	
)	
should	
also	
be	
excluded	
.	

These	
include	
:	
hypoglycemic	
states	
,	
peptic	
ulcer	
disease	
,	
reflux	
esophagitis

and	
Kluver

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Future	
Directions	

The	
extent	
of	
overlap	
and	
divergence	
between	
SRED	
and

needs	
to	
be	
further	
elucidated

typically

On

there	
may	
be	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
typical	
clinical	
history	
of	
RBD	
with

Therefore	
,	
medication

RBD	
can	
be	
diagnosed	
as	
RBD	
,	
using	
clinical	
judgment	
,	
pending

longitudinal	
studies	
.	

Essential	
Features	
RBD	
is	
characterized	
by	
abnormal	
behaviors	
emerging	
during	
REM	
sleep	
that	
may	
cause	
injury	
or	
sleep	
disruption	
.	

RBD	
is	
also	
associated	
with	
EMG	CANCER
abnormalities	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
EMG	CANCER
demonstrates	
an	
excess	
of	
muscle	ORGAN
tone	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
and/or	
an	
excess	
of	
phasic	
EMG	CANCER
twitch	CANCER
activity	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

A	
complaint	
of	
sleep	
related	
injury	
is	
common	
with	
RBD	
,	
which	
usually	
manifests	
as	
an	
attempted	
enactment	
of	
unpleasant	
,	
action	
-	
filled	
,	
and	
violent	
dreams	
in	
which	
the	
individual	
is	
being	
confronted	
,	
attacked	
,	
or	
chased	
by	
unfamiliar	
people	ORGANISM
or	
animals	
.	

Typically	
,	
at	
the	
end	
of	
an	
episode	
,	
the	
individual	
awakens	
quickly	
,	
becomes	
rapidly	
alert	
,	
and	
reports	
a	
dream	
with	
a	
coherent	
story	
.	

The	
dream	
action	
corresponds	
closely	
to	
the	
observed	
sleep	
behaviors	
.	

Sleep

Walking	
,	
however	
,	
is	
quite	
uncommon	
with	
RBD	
,	
and	
leaving	
the	
room	
is	
especially	
rare	
,	
because	
the	
eyes	ORGAN
are	
usually	
closed

precluding	
attention

Medical	
attention	
is	
usually	
sought	
after	
sleep	
related	
injury	
has	
occurred	
to	
either	
the	
person	
or	
the	
bed	
partner	
,	
and	
rarely	
because	
of	
sleep	
disruption	
.	

Because	
RBD	
occurs	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
it	
usually	
appears	
at	
least	
90	
minutes	
after	
sleep	
onset	
,	
unless	
there	
is	
coexisting	
narcolepsy

in

Daytime

This	
condition	
is	
male	
predominant	
,	
but	
less	
so	
than	
isolated	
RBD	
.	

Most	
cases	
begin	
during	
childhood	
or	
adolescence	
.	

Virtually	
all	
age	
groups	
can	
be	
affected

It	
can	
be	
idiopathic

Status	
dissociatus	
can	
be	
classified	
as	
a	
subtype	
of	
RBD	
that	
manifests	
as	
an	
extreme	
form	
of	
state	
dissociation	
without	
identifiable	
sleep	
stages	
,	
but	
with	
sleep	
and	
dream	
-	
related	
behaviors	
that	
closely	
resemble	
RBD	
.	

Status	
dissociatus	
represents	
a	
major	
breakdown	
of	
the	
polysomnographic	
markers	
for	
REM	
sleep	
,	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
,	
and	
wakefulness	
,	
with	
admixtures	
of	
these	
states	
being	
present	
,	
but	
with	
conventional	
sleep	
stages	
not	
being	
identifiable	
during	
polysomnographic	
monitoring	
.	

There	
is	
abnormal	
behavioral	
release	
that	
can	
be	
associated	
with	
disturbed	
dreaming	
,	
strongly	
suggestive	
of	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
that	
closely	
resemble	
RBD	
.	

Not	
uncommonly	
,	
the	
indi-	
vidual	
thinks	
he	
is	
awake	
when	
observers	
presume	
he	
is	
asleep	
and	
attempting	
to	
act	
out	
a	
dream

An	
underlying	
neurologic	
or	
medical	
condition	
,	
spanning	
a	
broad	
range	
of	
pathology	
,	
is	
virtually	
always	
present	
.	

Dream	
enactment	
(	
“	
oneirism	
”	
)	
that	
is	
REM	
sleep	
related	
or	
related	
to	
a	
dissociated	
REM	
sleep	
-	
wakefulness	
state	
can	
be	
a	
core	
feature	
of	
a	
pathologic	
condition	
called	
agrypnia	
excitata	
that	
is	
characterized	
by	
generalized	
motor	
overactivity	
,	
impaired	
ability	
to	
initiate	
and	
maintain	
sleep	
(	
with	
“

”	
)	
,	
loss	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
,	
and	
marked	
motor	
and	
autonomic	
sympathetic	
activation	
.	

Agrypnia	
excitata	
is	
found	
with	
such	
diverse	
conditions	
as	
delirium	
tremens	
,	
Morvan	
syndrome	
,	
and	
fatal	
familial	
insomnia	
.	

Thus	
,	
agrypnia	
excitata	
manifests	
as	
both	
a	
severe	
parasomnia	
and	
a	
severe	
insomnia	
.	

Demographics	
RBD	
is	
a	
male	
predominant	
disorder	
that	
usually	
emerges	
after	
age	
50	
years	
.	

Cases	
of	
RBD	
from	
early	
childhood	
up	
to	
age	
88	
years	
have	
been	
reported	
.	

RBD	
emerging	
in	
adults	
before	
age	
50	
years	
tends	
to	
have	
different	
demographics	
and	
associated	
features	
,	
including	
greater	
sex	
parity	
and	
increased	
rates	
of	
idiopathic	
RBD	
and	
para-	
somnia	
overlap	
disorder	
(	
POD	
)	
,	
comorbid	
narcolepsy	
,	
antidepressant	
medication	
use	
,	
and	
possibly	
autoimmune	
diseases	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
clinical	
presentation	
of	
RBD	
in	
younger	
adults	
differs	
from	
that	
in	
older	
adults	
in	
being	
less	
aggressive	
and	
violent	
,	
presumably	
due	
to	
greater	
female	ORGANISM
representation	
and	
higher	
rates	
of	
comorbid	
narco-	
lepsy	
(	
which	
manifests	
with	
milder	
RBD	
behaviors	
)	
.	

RBD	
associated	
with	
neurologic	
disorders	
and	
other	
symptomatic	
forms	
of	
RBD	
are	
as	
male	
predominant	
as	
idiopathic	
RBD	
,	
with	
the	
exception	
of	
narcolepsy	
(	
as	
described	
below	
)	
and	
multiple	
system	
atrophy	
.	

Of	
note	
,	
RBD	
may	
not	
be	
the	
presenting	
com-	ORGAN
plaint	
to	
a	
sleep	
disorders	
center	
.	

Therefore	
,	
systematic	
questioning	
for	
RBD	
should	
be	
included	
for	
all	
newly	
evaluated	
patients	ORGANISM
at	
a	
sleep	
center	
.	

RBD	
in	
children	ORGANISM
is	
virtually	
never	
idiopathic	
and	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
narcolepsy	
(	
at	
times	
emerging	
months	
before	
the	
emergence	
of	
narcoleptic	
symptoms	
)	
,	
brainstem	CANCER
tumors	CANCER
,	
antidepressant

,	
neurodevelopmental

,	
and	
various	
rare	
conditions	
.	

The	
prevalence	
is	
not	
known	
with	
much	
certainty	
,	
although	
a	
prevalence	
of	
0.38	
%	
to	
0.5	
%	
is	
reported	
in	
the	
elderly	
and	
the	
general	
population	
.	

A	
2.1	
%	
prevalence	
of	
current	
sleep	
related	
violence	
has	
been	
reported	
;	
38	
%	
of	
these	
events	
have	
associated	
dream

suggesting	
a	
prevalence	
of	
RBD	
as	
high	
as	
0.8

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	

The	
major	
predisposing	
factors	
are	
male	
sex	
,	
age	
50	
years	
or	
older	
,	
and	
an	
under-	
lying	
neurological	
disorder

,	
multiple	
system	
atrophy	
,	
dementia	
with	
Lewy	CELLULAR_COMPONENT
bodies	
,	
narcolepsy	
,	
or

.	

A	
recent	
multicenter

found	
that	
smoking

,	
and	
farming	
were	
significant	
risk

Medications	
,	
particularly	
the	
anti-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT

,	
mirtazapine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
and	
other	
antidepressant	
agents	
(	
but	
not	
bupropion	
)	
are	
an	
increasingly	
recognized	
precipitating	
factor	
.	

Beta

(	
bisoprolol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
atenolol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
)	
,	
anticholinesterase	
inhibitors	
,	
and	
selegiline	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
can	
also	
trigger	
RBD	
.	

Psychiatric	
disorders	
involving	
depression	
(	
that	
require	
antidepressant	
pharmacotherapy	
)	
may	
comprise	
a	
predisposing	
factor	
,	
particu-	
larly	
in	
adults	
younger	
than	
50	
years	
.	

RBD	
may	
also	
be	
associated	
with	
posttraumatic	
stress	
disorder	
.	

Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
Familial	
Pattern	
A	
recent	
multicenter	
controlled	
study	
revealed	
a	
significantly	
increased	
positive	
family	
history	
of	
dream	
enactment	
,	
raising	
the	
possibility	
of	
a	
genetic	
contribution	
to	
RBD	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
of	
chronic	
RBD	
can	
be	
gradual	
or	
rapid	
,	
and	
the	
course	
is	
often	
progressive	
.	

Complications	
include	
sleep	
related	
injuries	
to	
self	
and/or	
bed	
partner	
that	
at	
times	
are	
life	
threatening	
,	
and	
disruption	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
that	
can	
be	
severe	
.	

Marital	
discord	
due	
to	
the	
RBD	
is	
uncommon	
but	
can	
be	
severe	
when	
present	
,	
due	
to	
repeated	
injury	
and/or	
disruption	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
.	

Delayed	
emergence	
of	
a	
neurodegenerative	
disorder	
,	
often	
more	
than	
a	
decade	
after	
the	
onset	
of	
idiopathic	
RBD	
,	
is	
very	
common	
in	
men	ORGANISM
50	
years	
of	
age	
and	
older	
.	

These	
dis-	
orders	
include	
Parkinson	CANCER
disease	CANCER
(	
PD	
)	
,	
multiple	
system	
atrophy	
(	
MSA	CANCER
)	
,	
and	
dementia	
with	
Lewy	TISSUE

(	
DLB	
)	
.	

Two	
recently	
reported	
series	
found	
81	
%	
and	
82	
%	
eventual	
conversion	
rates	
from	
idiopathic	
RBD	
to	
parkinsonism	
/	
dementia	
(	
and	
also	
mild	
cog-	
nitive	
impairment	
in	
the	
latter	
study	
)	
.	

Conversely	
,	
RBD	
is	
present	
in	
>	
90	
%	
of	
reported	
cases	
of	
MSA	CANCER
,	
in	
approximately	
50	
%	
of	
reported	
cases	
of	
DLB	
,	
and	
in	
up	
to	
46	
%	
of	
reported	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
PD	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
stated	
previously	
,	
RBD	
can	
emerge	
in	
children	ORGANISM
,	
usually	
in	
association	
with	
narco-	
lepsy	
-	
cataplexy	
,	
brainstem	CANCER
tumors	CANCER
,	
or	
antidepressant	
medications	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Current	
evidence	
suggests	
a	
selective	
association	
between	
RBD	
and	
neurodegenera-	
tive	
disorders	
.	

The	
synucleinopathies	
comprise	
a	
set	
of	
neurodegenerative	
disorders	
that	
share	
a	
common	
pathologic	
lesion	
composed	
of	
aggregates	
of	
insoluble	
α	
-	
synu-	
clein	
protein	
in	
selectively	
vulnerable	
populations	
of	
neurons	CELL
and	
glial	CELL
cells	CELL
.	

These	
pathologic	
aggregates	
appear	
to	
be	
closely	
linked	
to	
the	
onset	
and	
progression	
of	
clin-	
ical	
symptoms	
and	
the	
degeneration	
of	
affected	
brain	ORGAN
regions	
in	
neurodegenerative	
disorders	
.	

The	
major	
synucleinopathies	
include	
PD	
,	
DLB	
,	
and	
MSA	CANCER
.	

RBD	
can	
be	
strongly	
linked	
with	
narcolepsy	
(	
almost	
always	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
)	
,	
rep-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
resenting	
another	
form	
of	
REM	
sleep	
motor	
-	
behavioral	
dyscontrol	
.	

The	
RBD	
may	
be	
precipitated	
or	
worsened	
by	
the	
pharmacologic	
treatment	
of	
cataplexy	
.	

RBD	
associ-	
ated	
with	
narcolepsy	
is	
now	
considered	
to	
be	
a	
distinct	
phenotype	
of	
RBD	
,	
character-	
ized	
by	
lack	
of	
sex	
predominance	
,	
less	
complex	
and	
more	
elementary	
movements	
in	
REM	
sleep	
,	
less	
violent	
behavior	
in	
REM	
sleep	
,	
earlier	
age	
of	
onset	
,	
and	
hypocretin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deficiency	
(	
that	
is	
characteristic	
of	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
)	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
RBD	
in	
pediat-	
ric	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
be	
an	
initial	
manifestation	
of	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
.	

Other	
reported	
etiologic	
associations	
of	
RBD	
with	
neurologic	
disorders	
include	
isch-	
emic	
or	
hemorrhagic	
cerebrovascular	ORGAN

The	
pathophysiology	
of	
human	ORGANISM
RBD	
is	
presumed	
to	
correspond	
to	
the	
findings	
from	
an	
animal	
model	
of	
RBD	
with	
respect	
to	
interruption	
of	
the	
REM

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
almost	
exclusively	
arm

during

,	
indicating	
the	
need

have	
excessive

The	
most	
current	
evidence

data	
for

Approximately	
75

a	
low

be	
a

Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
Differential	
Diagnosis	
RBD	
is	
one	
of	
several	
disorders	
that	
can	
manifest	
as	
complex	
,	
injurious	
,	
and	
violent	
sleep	
related	
and	
dream	
-	
related	
behaviors	
in	
adults	
.	

Other	
disorders	
that	
can	
mimic	
RBD	
in	
adults	
and/or	
children	ORGANISM
include	
sleepwalking	
,	
sleep	
terrors	
,	
OSA	
,	
nocturnal	
seizures	
(	
nocturnal	
frontal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION

epilepsy	
;	
nocturnal	
complex	
partial	
seizures	
)	
;	
rhyth-	
mic	
movement	
disorders	
;	
sleep	
related	
dissociative	
disorders	
,	
frightening	
hypnopom-	
pic	
hallucinations	
,	
and	
posttraumatic	
stress	
disorder	
;	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
malingering	
also	
should	
be	
considered	
.	

In	
general	
,	
RBD	
involves	
attempted	
enactment	
of	
unpleasant	
,	
aggressive	
dreams	
that	
usually	
occurs	
two	
or	
more	
hours	
after	
sleep	
onset	
,	
with	
rapid	
awakening	
from	
an	
episode	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
sleepwalking	
and	
sleep	
terror	
episodes	
often	
emerge	
within	
two	
hours	
after	
sleep	
onset	
,	
are	
not	
usually	
associated	
with	
rapid	
alertness	
,	
and	
are	
rarely	
associated	
with	
dreaming	
in	
children	ORGANISM
.	

Adults	
can	
have	
dreams	
associated	
with	
disor-	
ders	
of	
arousal	
,	
but	
they	
are	
usually	
more	
fragmentary	
and	
limited	
than	
RBD	
dreams	
.	

Sleep	
related	
seizures	
usually	
present	
with	
repetitive	
,	
stereotypical	
behaviors	
.	

Parasomnia	
overlap	
disorder	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
status	
dissociatus	
in	
several	
ways	
:	
if	
there	
is	
an	
awakening	
after	
an	
episode	
of	
RBD	
,	
sleepwalking	
,	
or	
sleep	
terror	
,	
there	
is	
the	
realization	
of	
having	
just	
been	
asleep	
;	
status	
dissociatus	
,	
however	
,	
is	
more	
likely	
to	
manifest	
with	
confusion	
over	
whether	
one	
is	
asleep	
,	
awake	
,	
or	
dreaming	
.	

vPSG	
in	
overlap	
conditions	
shows	
the	
typical	
findings	
for	
both	
RBD	
and	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
whereas	
with	
status	
dissociatus	
,	
there	
is	
an	
inability	
to	
discern	
sleep	
stages	
.	

Also	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
status	
dissociatus	
do	
not	
walk	
far	
during	
an	
episode	
,	
and	
their	
behavioral	
repertoire	
more	
closely	
resembles	
that	
of	
RBD	
than	
that	
of	
the	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Future	
Directions	
Numerous	
questions	
related	
to	
the	
vPSG	
evaluation	
of	
RBD	
remain	
unresolved	
.	

These	
include	
issues	
of	
defining	
and	
quantifying	
RWA	
and	
RBD	
activity	
such	
as	
:	
(

)	
What	
is	
the	
minimum	
REM	
sleep	
percentage	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
(	
and	
minimum	
absolute	
REM	
sleep	
time	
)	
needed	
to	
diagnose	
RWA	
or	
rule	
out	
RWA	
?	

(

)	
What	
is	
the	
minimum	
number	
of	
REM	
sleep	
epochs	
and	
minimum	
duration	
of	
REM	
sleep	
epochs	
necessary	
to	
diagnose	
RWA	
or	
rule	
out	
RWA	
?	

(

)	
What	
guidelines	
can	
be	
developed	
for	
diag-	
nosing	
or	
ruling	
out	
RWA	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
disrupted	
REM	
sleep	
continuity	
associated	
with	
conditions	
such	
as	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
and	
with	
medications	
?	

(	
4	
)	
What	
are	
the	
minimal	
amounts	
of	
true	
RBD	
behaviors	
documented	
by	
vPSG	
needed	
to	
identify	
RBD	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
without	
sufficient	
RWA	
?	

It	
is	
unclear	
why	
there	
is	
a	
male	
predominance	
of	
this	
disorder	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
and	
older	
adults	
.	

It	
is	
unknown	
if	
RBD	
subgroups	
other	
than	
men	ORGANISM
age	
50	
years	
or	
older	
demon-	
strate	
increased	
risk	
for	
development	
of	
parkinsonism	
or	
dementia	
.	

One	
such	
subgroup	
comprises	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
antidepressant	
-	
triggered	
RBD	
for	
whom	
the	
potential	
risk	
for	
future	
parkinsonism

dementia	
is	
unclear	
.	

New	
antidepressant	
or	
other	
psychotro-	
pic	
agents	
being	
developed	
for

use	
should	
be

Essential	
Features	
Recurrent	
isolated	
sleep	
paralysis	
is	
characterized	
by	
an	
inability	
to	
perform	
voluntary	
movements	
at	
sleep	
onset	
(	
hypnagogic	
or	
predormital	
form	
)	
or	
on	
waking	
from	
sleep	
(	
hypnopompic	
or	
postdormital	
form	
)	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	
.	

The	
event	
consists	
of	
an	
inability	
to	
speak	
or	
to	
move	
the	
limbs	ORGAN
,	
trunk	TISSUE
,	
and	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

Respiration	
is	
usually	
unaffected	
.	

Consciousness	
is	
preserved	
,	
and	
full	
recall	
is	
present	
.	

An	
episode	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
lasts	
seconds	
to	
minutes	
.	

It	
usually	
resolves	
spontaneously	
but	
can	
be	
aborted	
by	
sensory	
stimulation	
,	
such	
as	
being	
touched	
or	
spoken	
to	
,	
or	
by	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
making	
intense	
efforts	
to	
move	
.	

Associated	
Features	
At	
least	
during	
the	
initial	
episodes	
,	
intense	
anxiety	
is	
usually	
present	
.	

Hallucinatory	
experiences	
accompany	
the	
paralysis	
in	
about	
25	
%	
to	
75	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

These	
may	
include	
auditory	
,	
visual	
,	
or	
tactile	
hallucinations	
,	
or	
the	
sense	
of	
a	
presence	
in	
the	
room	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
experience	
predormital	
or	
postdormital	
hallucinations	
at	
separate	
times	
from	
episodes	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
.	

Clinical	
or	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
A	
familial	
form	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
has	
been	
described	
(	
see	
below	
)	
.	

Demographics	
Estimates	
of	
the	
prevalence	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
vary	
widely	
due	
to	
differences	
in	
the	
definition	
used	
,	
the	
age	
of	
the	
population	
sampled	
,	
and	
possibly	
cultural	
and	
ethnic	
factors	
.	

Most	
prevalence	
studies	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
(	
usually	
of	
students	
younger	
than	
30	
years	
)	
have	
investigated	
the	
occurrence	
of	
one	
or	
more	
episodes	
without	
require-	
ment	
of	
recurrence	
or	
distress	
.	

These	
suggest	
a	
15	
%	
to	
40	
%	
prevalence	
of	
at	
least	
one	
episode	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
.	

Two	
notable	
exceptions	
are	
a	
1962	
study	
of	
mostly	
college	
students	
that	
reported	
a	
prevalence	
of	
5	
%	
,	
and	
a	
1999	
study	
of	
all	
adult	
ages	
that	
found	
a	
prevalence	
of	
6	
%	
.	

No	
consistent	
sex	
differences	
have	
emerged	
from	
multiple	
studies	
.	

The	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
is	
14	
to	
17	
years	
,	
although	
onset	
earlier	
and	
later	
in	
life	
has	
been	
reported	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Sleep	
deprivation	
and	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedules	
have	
been	
identified	
as	
predis-	
posing	
factors	
to	
episodes	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
.	

Mental	
stress	
has	
been	
reported	
as	
a	
precipitating	
factor	
in	
some	
but	
not	
other	
studies	
.	

Sleep	
paralysis	
appears	
to	
be	
more	
common	
with	
sleep	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
.	

Personality	
factors	
have	
not	
been	
shown	
to	
play	
a	
major	
role	
,	
although	
one	
study	
found	
a	
higher	
score	
on	
the	
paranoia	
scale	
of	
the	
Minnesota	
Multiphasic	
Personality	
Inventory	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
sleep	
paralysis	
com-	ORGAN
pared	
to	
controls	
.	

Other	
factors	
that	
have	
been	
noted	
on	
regression	
analysis	
include	
an	
association	
with	
bipolar	
disorder	
,	
the	
use	
of	
anxiolytic	
medication	
,	
and	
sleep	
related

.	

Familial	
Pattern	
Two	
families	
with	
apparent	
familial	
sleep	
paralysis	
occurring	
over	
three	
and	
four	
gen-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
erations	
have	
been	
reported	
.	

A	
maternal	
form	
of	
transmission	
has	
been	
postulated	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
is	
usually	
in	
adolescence	
.	

Most	
events	
appear	
to	
occur	
in	
the	
second	
and	
third	
decades	
,	
but	
may	
continue	
later	
in	
life	
.	

There	
are	
no	
known	
complications	
,	
apart	
from	
anxiety	
over	
the	
episodes	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Though	
sleep	
paralysis	
may	
be	
present	
as	
part	
of	
the	
narcolepsy	
tetrad	
in	
children	ORGANISM
,	
there	
is	
no	
information	
currently	
available	
about	
childhood	
presentation	
of	
recurrent	
isolated	
sleep	
paralysis	
.	

Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Episodes	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
elicited	
by	
awakening	
patients	ORGANISM
from	
nocturnal	
sleep	
appear	
to	
arise	
from	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
paralysis	
is	
an	
example	
of	
state	
dissociation	
with	
ele-	
ments	
of	
REM	
sleep	
persisting	
into	
wakefulness	
.	

Early	
-	
onset	
REM	
sleep	
after	
forced	
awakenings	
has	
been	
shown	
to	
predispose	
an	
individual	
to	
having	
sleep	
paralysis	
.	

It	
may	
be	
that	
subjects	
with	
less	
tolerance	
to	
sleep	
disruption	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
experi-	
ence	
the	
phenomenon	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Analysis	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
after	
forced	
awakenings	
during

studies	
reveals	
the

Nightmare	
disorder	
in	
children	ORGANISM
is	
most	
likely	
to	
occur	
in	
those	
exposed	
to	
severe	
psychosocial	
stressors	
.	

Because	
childhood	
nightmares	
often	
resolve	
spontaneously	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
should	
be	
given	
only	
if	
there	
is	
persistent	
distress	
or	
impairment	
.	

Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
Essential	
Features	
Nightmare	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent	
,	
highly	
dysphoric	
dreams	
,	
which	
are	
disturbing	
mental	
experiences	
that	
generally	
occur	
during	
REM	
sleep	
and	
that	
often	
result	
in	
awakening	
.	

Given	
that	
these	
experiences	
are	
most	
often	
associated	
with	
REM	
sleep	
,	
the	
episodes	
have	
a	
greater	
tendency	
to	
occur	
during	
the	
second	
half	
of	
the	
major	
sleep	
episode	
when	
the	
REM	
pressure	
is	
most	
pronounced	
.	

Nightmares	
involve	
an	
internally	
generated	
conscious	
experience	
or	
dream	
sequence	
that	
seems	
vivid	
and	
real	
.	

They	
have	
a	
tendency	
to	
become	
increasingly	
more	
disturbing	
as	
they	
unfold	
.	

Emotions	
are	
characteristically	
negative	
and	
most	
frequently	
involve	
anxiety	
,	
fear	
,	
or	
terror	
but	
may	
also	
involve	
anger	
,	
rage	
,	
embarrassment	
,	
and	
disgust	
.	

Nightmare	
content	
most	
often	
focuses	
on	
imminent	
physical	
danger	
to	
the	
individual	
but	
may	
also	
involve	
other	
distressing	
themes	
.	

Ability	
to	
detail	
the	
nightmare	
’s	
contents	
upon	
awakening	
is	
common	
in	
nightmare	
disorder	
.	

Multiple	
nightmares	
within	
a	
single	
sleep	
episode	
may	
occur	
and	
may	
bear	
similar	
themes	
.	

Because	
nightmares	
typically	
arise	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
they	
may	
occur	
at	
any	
moment	
that	
REM	
pressure	
is	
high	
.	

Nightmares	
are	
very	
common	
in	
children	ORGANISM
.	

They	
typically	
occur	
in	
the	
last	
third	
of	
the	
night	
and	
result	
in	
a	
complete	
awakening	
,	
after	
which	
the	
child	
can	
often	
provide	
a	
detailed	
description	
of	
the	
frightening	
scenario	
.	

However	
,	
clear	
distinction	
from	
con-	
fusional	
arousals	
and	
sleep	
terrors	
in	
young	
children	ORGANISM
is	
often	
not	
possible	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Postawakening	
anxiety	
and	
difficulty	
returning	
to	
sleep	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Nightmares	
are	
more	
common	
in	
those	
with	
higher	
levels	
of	
anxiety	
.	

Additionally	
,	
nightmares	
are	
commonly	
seen	
in	
those	
who	
have	
been	
physically	
or	
sexually	
abused	
and	
in	
those	
suf-	
fering	
from	
posttraumatic	
stress	
disorder	
.	

Nightmares	
arising	
either	
immediately	
following	
a	
trauma	
(	
acute	
stress	
disorder	
[	
ASD	
]	
)	
or	
one	
month	
or	
more	
after	
a	
trauma	
(	
posttraumatic	
stress	
disorder	
[	
PTSD	
]	
)	
have	
been	
described	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
,	
especially	
N2	CANCER
,	
as	
well	
as	
during	
REM	
sleep	
and	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

Posttraumatic	
nightmares	
may	
take	
the	
form	
of	
a	
realistic	
reliving	
of	
a	
traumatic	
event	
or	
may	
depict	
only	
some	
of	
its	
elements	
or	
emotional	
content	
.

Demographics	
Occasional	
nightmares	
are	
very	
common	
in	
children	ORGANISM
,	
occurring	
in	
60	
%	
to	
75	
%	
of	
chil-	
dren	
,	
beginning	
as	
young	
as	
2.5	
years	
of	
age	
.	

The	
occurrence	
of	
occasional	
nightmares	
in	
children	ORGANISM
does	
not	
constitute	
a	
nightmare	
disorder	
.	

However	
,	
frequent	
nightmares	
are	
uncommon	
,	
occurring	
in	
1	
%	
to	
5	
%	
of	
preadolescent	
children	ORGANISM
.	

It	
is	
estimated	
that	
10	
%	
to	
50	
%	
of	
children	ORGANISM
aged	
three	
to	
five	
years	
have	
at	
least	
occasional	
nightmares	
severe	
enough	
to	
disturb	
their	
parents	
.	

Nightmares	
appear	
to	
be	
a	
trait	
-	
like	
characteristic	
that	
persists	
over	
time	
during	
childhood	
.	

The	
best	
predictor	
of	
recurrent	
nightmares	
at	
an	
older	
age	
is	
recurrent	
nightmares	
in	
childhood	
.	

Approximately	
2	
%	
to	
8	
%	
of	
the	
general	
population	
has	
a	
current	
problem	
with	
nightmares	
,	
and	
this	
frequency	
is	
higher	
in	
clini-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
cal	
populations	
.	

Trauma	
-	
related	
nightmares	
are	
the	
most	
consistent	
problem	
reported	
by	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
PTSD	
.	

Nightmares	
beginning	
within	
three	
months	
of	
a	
trauma	
are	
present	
in	
up	
to	
80	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
PTSD	
.	

Although	
approximately	
50	
%	
of	
PTSD	
cases	
resolve	
within	
three	
months	
,	
posttraumatic	
nightmares	
may	
persist	
throughout	
life	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Frequent	
nightmares	
are	
associated	
with	
enduring	
personality	
characteristics	
and	
psy-	
chopathologies	
;	
they	
are	
inversely	
correlated	
with	
measures	
of	
well	
-	
being	
.	

Associations	
with	
psychopathology	
have	
been	
identified	
for	
adults	
and	
adolescents	
,	
but	
research	
on	
children	ORGANISM
is	
largely	
absent	
other	
than	
for	
assessments	
of	
PTSD	
.	

Measures	
of	
nightmare	
distress	
are	
much	
more	
robustly	
associated	
with	
psychopathology	
than	
are	
measures	
of	
nightmare	
frequency	
.	

The	
clinical	
use	
of	
pharmacologic	
agents	
affecting	
the	
neurotransmitters	
norepinephrine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

serotonin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
and	
dopamine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
is	
associated	
with	
the	
complaint	
of

.	

A	
majority	
of	
these

are	
antidepressants

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Nightmares	
usually	
start	
between	
ages	
three	
years	
and	
six	
years	
.	

The	
proportion	
of	
children	ORGANISM
reporting	
nightmares	
reaches	
a	
peak	
between	
six	
and	
ten	
years	
of	
age	
and	
decreases	
thereafter	
.	

A

children	ORGANISM

have	
nightmares	
into	
Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
adolescence	
or	
adulthood	
and	
may	
become	
lifelong	
nightmare	
sufferers	
.	

Nightmares	
generally	
diminish	
in	
frequency	
and	
intensity	
over	
the	
course	
of	
decades	
,	
but	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
still	
describe	
frequent	
episodes	
at	
the	
age	
of	
60	
or	
70	
years	
.	

Nightmare	
dis-	
order	
can	
lead	
to	
sleep	
avoidance	
and	
deprivation	
,	
and	
thereby	
to	
more	
intense	
night-	
mares	ORGANISM
,	
which	
can	
produce	
insomnia	
.	

ASD	
and	
PTSD	
associated	
nightmares	
can	
develop	
at	
any	
age	
after	
physical	
or	
emo-	
tional	
trauma	
.	

Individuals	
with	
PTSD	
are	
at	
risk	
for	
developing	
mood	
disorders	
and	
depression	
,	
social	
and	
employment	
consequences	
,	
self	
-	
destructive	
and	
impulsive	
behavior	
,	
and

;	
it	
is	
not	
known	
to	
what	
extent	
the	
nightmares	
symp-	
tomatic	
of	
PTSD	
contribute	
to	
these	
complications	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
stated	
above	
,	
nightmares	
are	
very	
common	
in	
children	ORGANISM
but	
the	
occurrence	
of	
occa-	
sional	
nightmares	
does	
not	
constitute	
nightmare	
disorder	
.	

Population	
studies	
have	
revealed	
that	
the	
prevalence	
and	
frequency	
of	
nightmares	
increases	
through	
childhood	
into	
adolescence	
.	

For	
example	
,	
preschoolers	
seldom	
report	
“	
bad	
dreams	
.	
”	

Furthermore	
,	
in	
regard	
to	
the	
prevalence	
of	
nightmares	
,	
children	ORGANISM
appear	
to	
exhibit	
a	
sex	
divergence	
over	
time	
,	
with	
girls	
demonstrating	
higher	
prevalence	
by	
late	
adolescence

Objective	
Findings	
PSG	
recordings	
during	
actual	
nightmares	
are	
few	
in	
number	
and	
,	
in	
some	
instances	
,	
have	
shown	
abrupt	
awakenings	
from	
REM	
sleep	
preceded	
by	
accelerated	
heart	ORGAN
and	
respiratory	
rates	
.	

Highly	
disturbing	
dream	
content	
frequently	
contrasts	
strikingly	
with	
relatively	
minor	
autonomic	
changes	
.	

Distinctive	
anomalies	
in

architec-	
ture	CANCER
have	
not	
been	
demonstrated	
;	
brainstem	CELL
and	
auditory	
-	
evoked	
potentials	
appear	
normal	
.	

Recordings	
during	
posttraumatic	
nightmares	
are	
few	
but	
have	
been	
recorded	
from	
both	
REM	
and	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

PSG	
recordings	
of	
sleep	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
PTSD	
have	
provided	
widely	
variable	
results	
.	

PSG	
evaluation	
is	
not	
routinely	
performed	
but	
may	
be	
indicated	
in	
some	
circumstances	
to	
exclude	
other	
parasomnias	
such	
as	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
and	
sleep	
-	
associated	
sei-	
zures	
.	

A	
PSG	
is	
particularly	
appropriate	
if	
patients	ORGANISM
report	
nightmares	
in	
conjunction	
with	
sleep	
behaviors	
that	
are	
repetitive	
or	
stereotyped	
or	
are	
injurious	
to	
self	
or	
others	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Nightmare	
disorder	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
dream	
disturbances	
associated	
with	
certain	
other	
neurological	
and	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

Rare	
cases	
of	
seizures	
presenting	
only	
as	
“	
nightmares	
”	
have	
been	
reported	
and	
should	
be	
considered	
in	
the	
differential	
diagno-	
sis	
,	
particularly	
in	
those	
patients	ORGANISM
who	
present	
with	
a	
history	
of	
central	
nervous	
system	
disease	
.	

PSG	
or	
continuous	
video	
EEG	
may	
be	
necessary	
to	
identify	
nightmares	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
nocturnal	
seizures	
.	

Nightmares	
differ	
from	
sleep	
terrors	
in	
having	
detailed	
recollection	
of	
dreaming	
in	
contrast	
to	
fragments	
of	
dreams	
or	
no	
dream	
recall	
,	
pre-	
senting	
no	
or	
minimal	
overt	
movement	
or

activity	
,	
occurring	
late	
in	
the	
night	
,	
being	
followed	
by	
rapid

and	
difficulty

a

The

Patients	ORGANISM

However

Nocturnal	
panic

occur	
either	
during

,	
usually	
in	
the	
first

of	
the

Although	
frequency	
of	
panic	
attacks	
is	
correlated	
with	
frequency	
of	
night-	
mares	ORGANISM
and	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
report	
that

Sleep

Diagnostic	
and	
Statistical	
Manual	
of	
Mental	
Disorders	
,	
Fifth	
Edition	
(

These	
include	
dissociative	
identity	
disorder	
(	
formerly	
called	
multi-	
ple	
personality

)	
and	
dissociative	
fugue	
,	
in	
which	
individuals	
meeting

criteria	
for	
these	
diagnoses	
may	
at	
times	
experience	
the	
recall	
of

as	
a

Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
Nightmares	
that	
occur	
intermittently	
during	
the	
course	
of	
ASD	
or	
PTSD	
are	
an	
expected	
symptom	
of	
those	
mental	
disorders	
and	
do	
not	
always	
require	
independent	
coding	
as	
nightmare	
disorder	
.	

However	
,	
as	
is	
often	
the	
case	
,	
when	
the	
frequency	
and/or	
severity	
of	
posttraumatic	
nightmares	
is	
such	
that	
they	
require	
independent	
clinical	
attention	
,	
then	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
nightmare	
disorder	
should	
be	
applied	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
other	
symp-	
toms	ORGANISM
of	
PTSD	
may	
have	
largely	
resolved	
while	
the	
nightmares	
persist	
.	

Nightmare	
disorder	
should	
be	
coded	
in	
these	
cases	
as	
well	
.	

It	
is	
clinically	
important	
to	
establish	
whether	
nightmares	
are	
associated	
with	
PTSD	
or	
ASD	
because	
the	
evaluation	
,	
course	
,	
complications	
,	
and	
treatment	
differ	
significantly	
for	
these	
groups	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Basic	
pathophysiologic	
studies	
are	
still	
needed	
,	
especially	
studies	
contrasting	
“	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
idio-	
pathic	
”	
nightmare	
disorder	
and	
nightmares	
associated	
with	
PTSD	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
deter-	
mining	
whether	
posttraumatic	
nightmares	
arise	
from	
sleep	
or	
primarily	
from	
wakeful-	
ness	
would	
be	
an	
important	
distinguishing	
feature	
particularly	
when	
determining	
effec-	
tive	
clinical	
interventions	
.	

The	
PSG	
correlates	
of	
nightmare	
disorder	
and	
posttraumatic	
nightmares	
as	
well	
as	
the	
variables	
affecting	
dream	
mentation	
and	
recall	
require	
further	
definition	
and	
delineation	
.	

The	
distinction	
between	
nightmares	
and	
sleep	
terrors	
is	
difficult	
when	
assessed	
only	
by	
questionnaires	
.	

It	
still	
remains	
unclear	
to	
what	
degree	
and	
level	
of	
complexity	
sleep	
mentation	
is	
associated	
with	
sleep	
terrors	
.	

The	
topic	
of	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
dream	
distur-	
bances	
(	
other	
than	
disturbed	
mentation	
that	
may	
occur	
with	
sleep	
terrors	
)	
also	
needs	
formal	
investigation	
,	
including	
whether	
or	
not	
the	
term	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
nightmare	
should	
be	
utilized	
.	

The	
optimal	
methods	
for	
assessing	
nightmare	
frequency	
and	
nightmare	
distress	
are	
still	
unclear	
.	

Standardized	
scales	
assessing	
nightmare	
distress	
should	
be	
developed	
and	
utilized	
.	

Retrospective	
questionnaire	
-	
based	
evaluations	
of	
nightmares	
are	
problematic	
inasmuch	
as	
they	
underestimate	
nightmare	
frequencies	
relative	
to	
home	
logs	
,	
whereas	
home	
logs	
may	
selectively	
increase	
recall	
of	
nightmares

Essential	
Features	
Exploding	
head	CANCER
syndrome	CANCER
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
sudden	
,	
loud	
imagined	
noise	
or	
sense	
of	
a	
violent	
explosion	
in	
the	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
occurring	
as	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
is	
falling	
asleep	
or	
waking	
during	
the	
night	
.	

The	
event	
is	
variously	
described	
as	
a	
painless	
loud	
bang	
,	
an	
explosion	
,	
a	
clash	
of	
cymbals	
,	
or	
a	
bomb	
exploding	
,	
but	
occasionally	
may	
be	
a	
less	
alarming	
sound	
.	

It	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
a	
sense	
of	
fright	
,	
and	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
believe	
they	
are	
having	
a	
stroke	
.	

In	
a	
minority	
of	
cases	
a	
flash	
of	
light	
or	
myoclonic	
jerk	
may	
accompany	
the	
event	
.	

The	
abnormal	
sensation	
lasts	
a	
few	
seconds	
and	
may	
recur	
during	
further	
attempts	
at	
sleeping	
.	

The	
number	
of	
attacks	
varies	
—	
from	
many	
on	
a	
single	
night	
to	
infrequent	
—	
with	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
reporting	
clustering	
of	
attacks	
over	
several	
nights	
fol-	
lowed	
by	
a	
gap	
of	
weeks	
to	
months	
.	

A	
high	
level	
of	
clinical	
distress	
can	
be	
associated	
with	
recurrent	
attacks	
,	
with	
concern	
about	
their	
underlying	
cause	
.	

Associated	
Features	
A	
flash	
of	
light	
may	
accompany	
the	
sound	
,	
and	
a	
myoclonic	
jerk	
may	
sometimes	
occur	
.	

Although	
the	
event	
is	
typically	
painless	
,	
a	
simultaneous	
stab	
of	
pain	
in	
the	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
has	
occasionally	
been	
reported	
.	

An	
insomnia	
complaint	
may	
develop	
as	
a	
result	
of	
the	
recurring	
arousals	
and	
anxiety	
regarding	
the	
events	
.

or	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
None

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
is	
unknown	
.	

Exploding	
head	CANCER
syndrome	CANCER
is	
reported	
to	
be	
more	
common	
in	
women	ORGANISM
than	
in	
men	ORGANISM
.	

The	
median	
age	
of	
onset	
is	
58	
years	
,	
but	
onset	
at	
all	
ages	
has	
been	
reported	
,	
including	
the	
first	
and	
eighth	
decades	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Most	
patients	ORGANISM
do	
not	
detect	
precipitating	
factors	
,	
but	
some	
report	
increased	
numbers	
of	
attacks	
when	
under	
personal	
stress	
or	
overtired	
.	

Familial	
Pattern	
Occasional	
cases	
of	
exploding	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
syndrome	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
occurring	
in	
the	
same	
family	
have	
been	
reported	
,	
although	
it	
is	
not	
clear	
whether	
this	
represents	
a	
true	
familial	
pattern	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complication	
The	
course	
is	
benign	
with	
no	
reported	
neurologic	
sequelae	
.	

Frequent	
events	
on	
a	
single	
night	
can	
result	
in	
insomnia	
.	

Clinical	
levels	
of	
anxiety	
may	
result	
from	
patient	ORGANISM
concern	
about	
a	
serious	
medical	
basis	
for	
the	
exploding	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
syndrome	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

The	
condition	
may	
also	
exacerbate	
a	
comorbid	
migraine	
disorder	
.	

In	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
the	
symptoms	
appear	
to

spontaneously	
over	
some	
years

Developmental	
Issues	
Not

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
events	
occur	
most	
frequently	
during	
a	
period	
of	
drowsiness	
preceding	
sleep	
.	

Some	
events	
are	
reported	
to	
occur	
upon	
waking	
during	
the	
night	
,	
but	
may	
actually	
be

ring	
during	
reinitiating	
sleep

The	
condition	
appears	
to	
be	
a	
sensory	
variant	
of	
the	
better	
-	
known	
transient	
motor	
phenomenon	
of	
sleep

or	
hypnic	
jerks	
occurring	
at

.	

The	
neurophysiologic	
mechanisms	
underlying	
these	
hypnago-

phenomena	
are	
unknown	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
VPSG	
in	
a	
small	
sample

also	
resulting	
from

It	
does	
not

A.	ORGANISM

There	
is	
a	
complaint	
of	
recurrent	
hallucinations	
that	
are	
experienced	
just	
prior	
to	
sleep	
onset	
or	
upon	
awakening	
during	
the	
night	
or	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

B.	
The	
hallucinations	
are	
predominantly	
visual	
.	

C.	ORGANISM

The	
disturbance	
is	
not	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
sleep	
disorder	
(	
especially	
narcolepsy	
)	
,	
mental	
disorder	
,	
medical	
disorder	
,	
medication	
,	
or	
substance	
use	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
are	
hallucinatory	
experiences	
that	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
or	
on	
awakening	
from	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
are	
predominantly	
visual	
but	
may	
include	
auditory	
,	
tactile	
,	
or	
kinetic	
phenomena	
.	

Hallucinations	
at	
sleep	
onset	
(	
hypnagogic	
hallucinations	
)	
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
differentiate	
from	
sleep	
onset	
dream-	
ing	
.	

Hallucinations	
on	
waking	
in	
the	
morning	
(	
hypnopompic	
hallucinations	
)	
may	
arise	
out	
of	
a	
period	
of	
REM	
sleep	
,	
and	
patients	ORGANISM
also	
may	
be	
uncertain	
whether	
they	
rep-	
resent	
waking	
or	
dream	
-	
related	
experiences	
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	
may	
represent	
a	
distinct	
form	
of	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
.	

They	
typically	
occur	
fol-	
lowing	
a	
sudden	
awakening	
,	
without	
recall	
of	
a	
preceding	
dream	
.	

They	
usually	
take	
the	
form	
of	
complex	
,	
vivid	
,	
relatively	
immobile	
images	
of	
people	ORGANISM
or	
animals	
,	
sometimes	
distorted	
in	
shape	
or	
size	
.	

These	
hallucinations	
may	
remain	
present	
for	
many	
minutes	
but	
usually	
disappear	
if	
ambient	
illumination	
is	
increased	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
are	
clearly	
awake	
but	
often	
initially	
perceive	
the	
hallucinations	
as	
real	
and	
frightening	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
episodes	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
,	
either	
at	
the	
same	
time	
or	
on	
different	
nights	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hal-	
lucinations	
may	
jump	
out	
of	
the	
bed	
in	
terror	
,	
sometimes	
injuring	
themselves	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
experience	
other	
parasomnias	
,	
such	
as	
sleep	
talking	
or	
sleepwalking	
,	
sep-	
arate	
from	
the	
hallucinations	
;	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
may	
also	
experience	
similar	
complex	
hal-	
lucinations	
during	
the	
day	
,	
unassociated	
with	
sleep	
.

Clinical

Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Dream

like	
hypnagogic	
and	
hypnopompic	
hallucinations	
appear	
to	
differ	
in	
clini-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
cal	
features	
and	
pathogenesis	
from	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	
arising	
in	
wakefulness	
after	
sudden	
arousals	
during	
the	
night	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
are	
common	
in	
narcolepsy	
and	
also	
occur	
as	
occasional	
phenomena	
in	
a	
high	
per-	
centage	
of	
the	
general	
population	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucina-	
tions	
appear	
to	
be	
rare	
and	
occur	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
a	
range	
of	
neurologic	
and	
visual	
disorders	
(	
see	
Differential	
Diagnosis	
)	
as	
well	
as	
in	
an	
idiopathic	
form	
.	

However	
,	
further	
work	
is	
needed	
to	
establish	
whether	
or	
not	
these	
forms	
of	
hallucinations	
represent	
different	
entities	
.	

Demographics	
In	
large	
European	
population	
studies	
,	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
occur	
with	
a	
prevalence	
of	
25	
%	
to	
37	
%	
for	
hypnagogic	
hallucinations	
,	
whereas	
the	
equivalent	
reported	
prevalence	
for	
hypnopompic	
hallucinations	
is	
7	
%	
to	
13	
%	
.	

Both	
hypnagogic	
and	
hypnopompic	
hallucinations	
are	
more	
common	
in	
younger	
persons	
and	
occur	
slightly	
more	
frequently	
in	
women	ORGANISM
than	
in	
men	ORGANISM
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Multivariate	
analyses	
in	
large	
population	
studies	
have	
suggested	
that	
sleep	
related	
hal-	
lucinations	
are	
associated	
with	
younger	
age	
,	
current

,

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
appear	
to	
be	
more	
common	
in	
adolescence	
and	
early	
adult-	
hood	
.	

In	
many	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
the	
frequency	
appears	
to	
decrease	
with	
age	
.	

The	
natural	
history	
of	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	
depends	
on	
the	
underlying	
cause	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Not	
known	
or	
applicable	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
It	
is	
presumed	
that	
most	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
are	
due	
to	
dream	
ideation	
of	
REM	
sleep	
intruding	
into	
wakefulness	
,	
but	
this	
has	
not	
been	
firmly	
established	
.	

Infrequent	
hallucinations	
of	
this	
type	
may	
be	
within	
the	
limits	
of	
normal	
sleep	
-	
wake	
transition	
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	
may	
in	
some	
cases	
be	
release	
phenomena	
in	
which	
loss	
of	
visual	
input	
or	
decreased	
reticular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
activating	
system	
activity	
results	
in	
the	
visual	
cortex	CANCER
generating	
aberrant	
images	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Hypnagogic	
hallucinations	
appear	
to	
arise	
predominantly	
from	
sleep	
onset	
REM	
periods	
.	

However	
,	
the	
very	
few	
reports	
of	
polysomnography	
in	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	
suggest	
an	
onset	
from	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

MRI	
scans	
of	
the	
brain	ORGAN
,	
PSG	
,	
EEG	CANCER
,	
and	
neuropsychological	
testing	
may	
help	
in	
the	
differential	
diagnosis	
and	
in	
identifying	
underlying	
disorders	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Nightmares	
are	
frightening	
dreams	
awakening	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
from	
sleep	
.	

They	
are	
clearly	
recognized	
as	
dreams	
and	
do	
not	
persist	
into	
wakefulness	
.	

Exploding	
head	CANCER
syndrome	CANCER
consists	
of	
a	
sudden	
sensation	
of	
an	
explosion	
in	
the	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
usually	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sometimes	
accompanied	
by	
a	
noise	
or	
flash	
of	
light	
.	

It	
does	
not	
involve	
complex	
visual	
imagery	
and	
lasts	
only	
seconds	
.	

In	
RBD	
,	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
acts	
out	
dreams	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

If	
not	
awakened	
by	
an	
observer	
,	
the	
person	
usually	
has	
little	
recollection	
of	
dream	
content	
.	

Sleepwalking	
may	
occasionally	
be	
associated	
with	
dream	
ideation	
,	
but	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
recognizes	
that	
the	
dream	
occurred	
during	
sleep	
.	

Visual	
hallucinations	
can	
be	
due	
to	
epileptic	
seizures	
but	
are	
usually	
brief	
,	
stereotyped	
,	
and	
fragmentary	
in	
such	
cases	
.	

Occasionally	
,	
complex	
visual	
hallucinations	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
migraine	
but	
are	
usually	
followed	
by	
a	
headache	
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	
may	
be	
seen	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
narcolepsy	
,	
PD	
,	
DLB	
,	
visual	
loss	
(	
Charles

,	
and	
midbrain	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
and

(

)	
,	
as	
well	
as	
with	
the	
use	
of

adrenergic	
receptor-

medications	
.	

Anxiety	
disorders	
have	
been	
noted	
in	
some	
patients	ORGANISM

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

In	
contrast	
to	
the	
extensive	
study	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
,	
little	
work	
has	
been	
reported	
on	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
.	

It	
is	
uncertain	
whether	
they	
represent	
normal	
variants	
or	
pathologic	
entities	
.	

It	
is	
unclear	
whether	
they	
are	
always	
associated	
with	
REM	
sleep	
intruding	
into	
wakefulness	
.	

It	
is	
uncertain	
how	
frequently	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	
are	
an	
independent	
entity	
,	
as	
opposed	
to	
representing	
a	
final	
common	
pathway	
of	
a	
range	
of	
other	
disorders	
.	

Further	
work	
is	
needed	
to	
determine	
from	
which	
stages	
of	
sleep	
they	
arise

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
enuresis	
(	
SE	
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent	
involuntary	
voiding	
that	
occurs	
during	
sleep	
.	

In	
primary	
SE	
,	
recurrent	
involuntary	
voiding	
occurs	
at	
least	
twice	
a	
week	
during	
sleep	
after	
five	
years	
of	
age	
in	
a	
patient	ORGANISM
who	
has	
never	
been	
consistently	
dry	
during	
sleep	
for	
six	
consecutive	
months	
.	

SE	
is	
considered	
secondary	
in	
a	
child	
or	
adult	
who	
had	
previously	
been	
dry	
for	
six	
consecutive	
months	
and	
then	
began	
wetting	
at	
least	
twice	
a	
week	
.	

Both	
primary	
and	
secondary	
enuresis	
must	
be	
present	
for	
a	
period	
of	
at	
least	
three	
months	
.	

Though	
primary	
and	
secondary	
enuresis	
share	
the	
common	
symptom	
of	
voiding	
during	
sleep	
,	
they	
are	
understood	
as	
distinct	
phenomena	
with	
different	
etiologies	
.	

SE	
is	
associated	
with	
difficulty	
arousing	
from	
sleep	
in	
response	
to	
an	
urge	
to	
urinate	
and	
may	
occur	
during	
any	
sleep	
stage	
.	

Sleep	
disorders	
that	
fragment	
sleep	
such	
as	
sleep	
apnea	
are	
associated	
with	
SE	
,	
and	
treatment	
of	
these	
disorders	
may	
cure	
or	
reduce	
their	
incidence	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Involuntary	
voiding	
during	
wakefulness	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
SE	
and	
,	
if	
present	
,	
generally	
points	
toward	
a	
physiological	
etiology	
.	

Psychosocial	
problems	
are	
consid-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
ered	
a	
relatively	
rare	
cause	
in	
primary	
SE	
,	
though	
it	
does	
occur	
more	
commonly	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
attention	
deficit	
hyperactivity	
disorder	
and	
in	
children	ORGANISM
living	
in	
disorga-

.	

Secondary	
SE	
is	
seen	
more	
commonly	
in	
children	ORGANISM
who	
have	
recently	
experienced	
a	
significant	
psychosocial	
stress	
,	
such	
as	
parental	
divorce	
,	
physical	
or	
sexual	
abuse	
,	
or	
neglect	
.	

Chronic	
constipation	
and	
encopresis	
(	
fecal	
soiling	
)	
often	
occur	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
secondary	
SE	
.	

SE	
can	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
diabetes	
and	
urinary	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
tract	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
infection	
.	

It	
may	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
nocturnal	
epilepsy	
.	

Among	
older	
adults	
,	
SE	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
symptoms	
of

reported	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
refractory	
SE	
.	

A	
large	
epidemiology	
study	
of	
children	ORGANISM
aged	
6	
-	
10	
years	
found	
that	
a	
current	
complaint	
of	
SE	
was	
significantly	
associated	
with	
increased	
ORs	CELL
(	
2.7

)	
for	
subjectively	
high	
arousal	
threshold	
,	
night	
terrors	
,	
nocturia	
,	
and	
confusion	
when	
awakened	
from	
sleep	
.	

Other	
studies	
have	
found	
mouth	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
breathing	
,	
nasal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
congestion	
,	
snoring	
,	
and	
restless

to	
be

to	
enuresis	
in	
children	ORGANISM

Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
The	
most	
important	
distinction	
is	
between	
primary	
and	
secondary	
SE	
.	

Demographics	
SE	
occurs	
in	
15	
%	
to	
20	
%	
of	
5	
-	
year	
-	
olds	
.	

It	
is	
three	
times	
more	
common	
in	
boys	ORGANISM
than	
in	
girls	
.	

SE	
is	
reported	
by	
2.1	
%	
of	
community	
-	
dwelling	
older	
adults	
and	
is	
more	
common	
among	
women	ORGANISM
than	
men	ORGANISM
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
etiology	
of	
SE	
is	
complex	
.	

The	
factors	
that	
precipitate	
SE	
on	
a	
particular	
night	
and	
at	
a	
particular	
time	
remain	
unknown	
.	

One	
popular	
model	
hypothesizes	
that	
SE	
consists	
of	
three	
interrelated	
factors	
:	
large	
nocturnal	
urine	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
volume	
production	
,	
noc-	
turnal	
bladder	ORGAN
overactivity	
,	
and	
difficulty	
arousing	
from	
sleep	
.	

Several	
studies	
suggest	
difficulty	
arousing	
from	
sleep	
is	
most	
important	
in	
primary	
enuresis	
,	
whereas	
bladder	ORGAN
instability	
/	
overactivity	
is	
more	
important	
in	
secondary	
enuresis	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
with	
enuresis	
are	
often	
described	
by	
their	
families	
as	
“	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
deep	
sleepers	
”	
and	
very	
difficult	
to	
arouse	
.	

A	
high	
arousal	
threshold	
has	
been	
objectively	
confirmed	
in	
these	
children	ORGANISM
.	

It	
has	
been	
reported	
that	
fragmentation	
of	
sleep	
by	
disorders	
such	
as	
sleep	
apnea	
is	
highly	
correlated	
with	
SE	
.	

Sleep	
fragmenting	
disorders	
such	
as	
sleep	
apnea	
and	
PLMS	
have	
been	
previously	
reported	
to	
be	
proximal	
triggers	
for	
the	
occurrence	
of	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
—	
sleepwalking	
,	
confusional	
arousals	
,	
and	
night	
terrors	
.	

Successful	
treatment	
of	
sleep	
apnea	
in	
these	
disorders	
has	
been	
reported	
to	
result	
in	
reduction	
or	
elimination	
of	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Similarly	
,	
surgical	
treatment	
of	
sleep	
apneas	
by	
adenotonsillec-	
tomy	
has	
been	
reported	
to	
cure	
nocturnal	
enuresis	
in	
60	
%	
or	
more	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
although	
this	
is	
not	
a	
consistent	
result	
.	

Several	
studies	
have	
noted	
the	
presence	
of	
sleep	
related	
breathing	
disorder	
in	
>	
40	
%	
of	
enuresis	
patients	ORGANISM
studied	
.	

However	
,	
not	
all	
sleep	
studies	
have	
noted	
SRBD	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
enuresis	
.	

Those	
without	
SRBD	
were	
still	
found	
to	
have	
high	
arousal	
threshold	
from	
sleep	
.	

Primary	
SE	
is	
a	
disorder	
that	
occurs	
when	
an	
individual	
fails	
to	
arouse	
from	
sleep	
in	
response	
to	
bladder	ORGAN
sensations	
or	
fails	
to	
inhibit	
a	
bladder	ORGAN
contraction	
.	

These	
are	
devel-	CELLULAR_COMPONENT
opmentally	
acquired	
skills	
,	
and	
,	
as	
such	
,	
there	
is	
a	
range	
in	
the	
ages	
of	
their	
acquisition	
.	

A	
small	
proportion	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
primary	
SE	
lack	
the	
normal	
increase	
in	
vasopressin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
release	
during	
sleep	
,	
leading	
to	
a	
high	
urinary	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
volume	
that	
exceeds	
the	
bladder	CANCER
capac-	CANCER
ity	
.	

If	
these	
children	ORGANISM
do	
not	
arouse	
to	
the	
sensation	
of	
a	
full	
bladder	ORGAN
,	
primary	
SE	
is	
the	
result	
.	

Secondary	
SE	
can	
be	
caused	
by	
,	
or	
be	
associated	
with	
,	
any	
one	
of	
the	
following	
identifiable	
problems	
:	
(

or

and

alization	
.	

The	
mechanisms	
by	
which	
secondary	
SE	
is	
associated	
with	
these	
problems	
are	
often	
not	
understood	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Hereditary	
factors	
are	
suspected	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
primary	
enuresis	
.	

There	
is	
often	
a	
high	
prevalence	
of	
enuresis	
among	
the	
parents	
,	
siblings	
,	
and	
other	
relatives	
of	
the	
child	
with	
primary	
enuresis	
.	

The	
reported	
prevalence	
is	
77	
%	
when	
both	
parents	
were	
enuretic	
as	
children	ORGANISM
and	
44	
%	
when	
one	
parent	
has	
a	
history	
of	
enuresis	
.	

Recent	
linkage	
studies	
support	
the	
hypothesis	
of	
genetic	
and	
phenotypic	
heterogeneity	
of	
SE	
.	

A	
putative	
linkage	
of	
SE	
to	
a	
region	
on	
chromosomes	CELLULAR_COMPONENT
22q	
,	
13q	
,	
and	
12q	
across	
different	
families	
has	
been	
reported	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Voiding	
is	
a	
spinal	
reflex	
during	
wakefulness	
and	
sleep	
during	
infancy	
,	
until	
about	
18	
months	
of	
age	
.	

Between	
18	
months	
and	
three	
years	
of	
age	
,	
the	
child	
is	
able	
to	
delay	
voiding	
with	
a	
full	
bladder	ORGAN
,	
first	
during	
wakefulness	
and	
at	
a	
later	
age	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
primary	
determinant	
of	
the	
age	
at	
which	
this	
skill	
is	
acquired	
is	
developmental	
matura-	
tion	
.	

Somewhat	
arbitrarily	
,	
primary	
SE	
is	
defined	
as	
a	
problem	
if	
it	
persists	
beyond	
five	
years	
of	
age	
.	

The	
spontaneous	
cure	
rate	
is	
15	
%	
per	
year	
.	

The	
primary	
complication	
of	
SE	
is	
to	
the	
child	
’s	
self	
-	
esteem	
.	

How	
well	
the	
child	
’s	
family	
deals	
with	
the	
symptom	
is	
an	
important	
determinant	
of	
whether	
complications	
develop	
.	

Secondary	
SE	
can	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
.	

Complications	
of	
secondary	
SE	
are	
determined	
by	
the	
problem	
leading	
to	
the	
enuresis	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
The	
developmental	
pattern	
of	
enuresis	
is	
similar	
to	
NREM	
parasomnias	
,	
although	
its	
first	
occurrence	
in	
adulthood	
is	
uncommon	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
SE	
is	
a	
heterogeneous	
disorder	
with	
various	
underlying	
pathophysiological	
mecha-	
nisms	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
mismatch	
between	
nocturnal	
bladder	ORGAN
capacity	
and	
the	
amount	
of	
Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
urine	
produced	
during	
sleep	
,	
in	
association	
with	
a	
simultaneous	
failure	
of	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
in	
response	
to	
the	
sensation	
of	
bladder	ORGAN
fullness	
.	

SE	
can	
be	
seen	
in	
association	
with	
sleep	
fragmentation	
disorders	
including	
SRBD	
,	
which	
in	
children	ORGANISM
is	
most	
often	
secondary	
to	
adenotonsillar	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
hypertrophy	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

Objective	
Findings	
In	
primary	
and	
secondary	
SE	
,	
enuretic	
episodes	
can	
occur	
in	
all	
sleep	
stages	
,	
during	
nocturnal	
wakefulness	
,	
and	
in	
association	
with	
transient	
arousals	
.	

Sleep	
stages	
have	
not	
been	
found	
to	
be	
different	
on	
nights	
when	
enuresis	
occurs	
versus	
nights	
on	
which	
it	
does	
not	
occur	
.	

The	
results	
of	
polysomnographic	
studies	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
enuresis	
com-	ORGAN
pared	
to	
normal	
controls	
have	
been	
inconsistent	
.	

A	
computerized	
power	
analysis	
of	
sleep	
data	
suggested	
an	
increase	
in	
delta	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
power	
,	
whereas	
the	
majority	
of	
other	
studies	
have	
reported	
no	
differences	
.	

However	
,	
a	
recent	
study	
found	
those	
age	
6	
-	
14	
years	
had	
elevated	
light	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
and	
reduced	
N3	
sleep	
and	
REM	
sleep	
compared	
to	
normal	
controls	
.	

The	
population	
with	
enuresis	
had	
a	
significantly	
elevated	
arousal	
index	
.	

SRBD	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
8	
%	
to	
47	
%	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
SE	
.	

SE	
and	
sleep	
apnea	
are	
highly	
correlated	
with	
an	
increasing	
prevalence	
of	
enuresis	
as	
the	
respiratory	
distur-	
bance	
index	
(	
RDI	
)	
increases	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
SRBD	
,	
PLMS	
(	
range	
of	
3.9	
to	
38.6	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
)	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
a	
group	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
treatment	
-	
resistant	
SE	
.	

Recent	
studies	
have	
demonstrated	
that	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
enuresis	
are	
subjectively	
sleepier	
than	
normal	
controls	
.	

This	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
to	
result	
from	
fragmented	
nocturnal	
sleep	
and	
is	
consistent	
with	
a	
large	
body	
of	
sleep	
research	
in	
other	
areas	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Enuresis	
may	
be	
caused	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
medical	
or	
neurological	
disorders	
such	
as	
diabetes	
mellitus	
,	
diabetes	
insipidus	
,	
epilepsy	
,	
sickle	
cell	
disease	
,	
bowel	ORGAN
or	
bladder	ORGAN
dysfunction	
,	
anatomical	
abnormalities	
or	
infection	
of	
the	
urinary	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
tract	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
,	
neurological/	
developmental	
disorders	
or	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
especially	
OSA	
.	

Organic	
pathology	
of	
the	
urinary	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
tract	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
is	
more	
prevalent	
in	
children	ORGANISM
who	
,	
in	
addition	
to	
sleep	
enuresis	
,	
also	
exhibit	
daytime	
enuresis	
,	
abnormalities	
in	
the	
initiation	
of	
micturition	
,	
or	
abnormal	
urinary	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
flow	
.	

Evaluation	
of	
sleep	
enuresis	
should	
include	
complete	
enuresis	
history	
,	
sleep	
history	
,	
physical	
examination	
and	
laboratory	
studies	
(	
as	
indicated	
)	
to	
exclude	
these	
etiol-	
ogies	
.	

When	
signs	
and	
symptoms	
of	
sleep	
apnea	
are	
present	
—	
mouth	
breathing	
,	
snoring	
,	
adenotonsillar	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY
hypertrophy	
,	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
hyperactivity	
—	
a	
sleep	
study	
should	
be	
conducted	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
Recent	
advances	
suggest	
that	
the	
terms	
primary	
and	
secondary	
enuresis	
may	
be	
overly	
simplistic	
.	

Further	
work	
is	
necessary	
to	
understand	
the	
genetic	
and	
clinical	
aspects	
of	
SE	
.	

Other	
sleep	
disorders	
are	
common	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
SE	
.	

Though	
it	
may	
be	
possible	
that	
the	
apneas	
,	
hypopneas	
,	
and	
snoring	
-	
related	
arousals	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
SRBD	CANCER
could	
be	
the	
trigger	
of	
SE	
,	
many	
children	ORGANISM
with	
SE	
do	
not	
have	
a	
sleep	
disorder	
.	

In	
such	
cases	
,	
the	
underlying	
bladder	ORGAN
overactivity	
may	
be	
the	
stimulus	
for	
arousal	
.	

Studies	
of	
the	
relationship	
of	
sleep	
,	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
and	
sleep	
fragmentation	
to	
SE	
performed	
to	
date	
have	
been	
inconsistent	
.	

This	
is	
likely	
due	
to	
differing	
definitions	
of	
enuresis	
and	
varying	
research	
methodologies	
.	

Further	
sophisticated	
sleep	
laboratory	
studies	
are	
necessary	
to	
elucidate	
the	
relationship	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
the	
proximal	
trigger	
for	
episodes	
of	
SE	
has	
not	
been	
determined	
.	

Some	
studies	
suggest	
enuresis	
is	
sponta-	
neous	
,	
whereas	
others	
suggest	
a	
relationship	
to	
sleep	
disorders	
that	
result	
in	
arousals	
—	
similar	
to	
findings	
in	
disorders	
of	
arousal

ICD-10

G47.54	
The	
essential	
feature	
of	
this	
diagnosis	
is	
the	
presence	
of	
a	
parasomnia	
that	
is	
attrib-	
utable	
to	
an	
underlying	
neurological	
or	
medical	
condition	
.	

RBD	
is	
the	
parasomnia	
most	
commonly	
associated	
with	
an	
underlying	
neurological	
condition	
(	
“	
symptomatic	
RBD	
”	
)	
.	

However	
,	
when	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
RBD	
are	
met	
,	
the	
more	
specific	
diagno-	
sis	
of	
REM	
sleep	
behavior	
disorder	
should	
be	
made	
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	
sleep	
related	
(	
hypnagogic	
and	
hypnopompic	
)	
visual	
hallucina-	
tions	
can	
occur	
with	
neurological	
disorders	
such	
as	
narcolepsy	
,	
PD	
,	
DLB	
,	
visual	
loss	
(	
Charles	
Bonnet	
hallucinations	
)	
,	
and	
midbrain	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
and	
diencephalic	
pathology	
(	
pedun-	
cular	
hallucinosis	
)	
.	

Dreaming	
and	
sleep	
paralysis	
may	
or	
may	
not	
be	
associated	
with	
these	
hallucinations	
.

The	
essential	
feature	
of	
this	
diagnosis	
is	
the	
close	
temporal	
relationship	
between	
expo-	
sure	
to	
a	
drug	
,	
medication	
,	
or	
biological	
substance	
and	
the	
onset	
of	
the	
signs	
and	
symp-	
toms	ORGANISM
of	
that	
disorder	
.	

A	
likely	
causal	
relationship	
can	
be	
inferred	
if	
signs	
and	
symp-	
toms	ORGANISM
of	
the	
parasomnia	
disappear	
when	
the	
drug	
or	
substance	
is	
withdrawn	
.	

The	
emergent	
parasomnia	
can	
be	
a	
de	
novo	
parasomnia	
,	
the	
aggravation	
of	
a	
chronic	
intermittent	
parasomnia	
,	
or	
the	
reactivation	
of	
a	
previous	
parasomnia	
.	

As	
discussed	
previously	
,	
a	
variety	
of	
medications	
and	
biological	
substances	
,	
including	
selective	
serotonin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
reuptake	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
inhibitors	
,	
venlafaxine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
tricyclic	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
antidepressants	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

,	
mirtazapine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
bisoprolol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
selegiline	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
or	
cholinergic	
treatment	
for	
Alzheimer	
disease	
,	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
associated	
with	
acute	
or	
chronic	
RBD	
.	

Acute	
RBD	
can	
also	
be	
seen	
during	
states	
of	
withdrawal	
from	
cocaine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
amphetamine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
barbiturate	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
and	
meprobamate	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
abuse	
.	

Caffeine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
chocolate	
abuse	
have	
been	
implicated	
in	
causing	
or	
unmasking	
RBD	
.	

However	
,	
when	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
RBD	
are	
met	
,	
the	
more	
specific	
diagnosis	
of	
REM	
sleep	
behavior	
disorder	
should	
be	
made	
.	

The	
use	
of	
medications	
such	
as	
β	
-	
adrenergic	
receptor	
-	
blocking	
agents	
can	
be	
associ-	
ated	
with	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
.	

When	
the	
clinical	
presentation	
suggests	
a	
direct	
relationship	
between	
a	
drug	
or	
substance	
and	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
parasomnia	
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
should	
be	
employed	
.	

Sedative	
-	
hypnotics	
such	
as	
zolpidem	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
zopiclone	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
have	
been	
associated	
with	
apparent	
NREM	
parasomnias	
including	
SRED	
and	
sleep	
driving	
.	

It	
has	
been	
suggested	
that	
sleep	
driving	
is	
an	
overlap	
behavior	
in	
which	
the	
sedative	
-	
hypnotic	
increases	
the	
arousal	
threshold	
during	
sleep	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
the	
behavior	
,	
while	
later	
behavior	
is	
due	
to	
the	
CNS	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
depressing	
effects	
of	
the	
drug	
while	
awake	
.	

It	
has	
not	
been	
determined	
if	
drug	
-	
re-	
lated	
NREM	
parasomnias	
are	
associated	
with	
the	
same	
genetic	
predisposition	
,	
priming	
factors	
,	
and	
triggers	
observed	
in	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

When	
clinical	
presentation	
sug-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
gests	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
a	
direct	
relationship	
between	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
and	
use	
of	
a	
drug	
or	
substance	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
parasomnia	
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
should	
be	
employed	
.	

Alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
has	
often	
appeared	
on	
lists	
of	
potential	
sleepwalking	
triggers	
without	
a	
basis	
in	
reliable	
empirical	
scientific	
research	
.	

Recent	
evidence	
-	
based	
reviews	
have	
found	
no	
relationship	
between	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
sleepwalking	
.	

The	
behavior	
of	
the	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
-	
in-	
toxicated	
individual	
may	
superficially	
resemble	
that	
of	
the	
sleepwalker	
.	

However	
,	
the	
sleepwalker	
is	
typically	
severely	
cognitively	
impaired	
,	
but	
with	
only	
limited	
motor	
impairment	
.	

The	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
-	
intoxicated	
individual	
’s	
level	
of	
cognitive	
functioning	
may	
be	
reduced	
,	
but	
not	
absent	
,	
whereas	
motor	
behavior	
is	
severely	
impaired	
.	

Proponents	
of	
the	
theory	
of	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
related	
sleepwalking	
suggest	
that	
the	
effects	
of	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
are	
similar	
to	
that	
of	
sleep	
deprivation	
—	
that	
is	
,	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
increases	
deep	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
this	
claim	
in	
not	
substantiated	
by	
sleep	
laboratory

based	
studies	
in	
normal	
controls	
,	
and	
no	
empirical	
sleep	
studies	
of	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
sleepwalking	
have	
ever	
been	
conducted	
.	

There	
is	
no	
scientific	
evidence	
that	
complex	
behaviors	
occurring	
during	
the	
sleep	
period	
following	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
ingestion	
are	
anything	
other	
than	
the	
nocturnal

.	

Unconsciousness	
,	
intoxication	
,	
and	
sleep	
are	
very	
different	
states	
of	
consciousness	
.	

Parasomnias	
should	
be	
easily	
distinguished	
from	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
intoxication	
by	
the	
presence	
of	
significant	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

prior	
to

.	

The	
association	
of	
therapeutic	
doses	
of	
sedative	
hypnotic	
drugs	
and	
apparent	
para-	
somnias	
should	
be	
carefully	
distinguished	
from	
the	
expected	
effects	
of	
drug

or	
misuse	
that	
result	
in

Investigations	
of

had

attributed

reported	
to	
show	
that	
(

Driving	
with	
a	
high

of	
a

can	
result	
in	
significant

Serious

can	
result	
.	

Sleep

and

complex	
behaviors	
in	
this	
population	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
have	
resulted	
from

rather	
than

This	
diagnosis	
is	
intended	
for	
parasomnias	
that	
can	
not

classified	
elsewhere	
or	
for	
cases	
in

Variants	
Sleep	
Talking	
Alternate	
Names	
Somniloquy	
.	

The	
essential	
feature	
is	
talking	
,	
with	
varying	
degrees	
of	
comprehensibility	
,	
during	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
may	
occur	
during	
REM	
or	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
can	
be	
idiopathic	
or	
associated	
with	
parasomnias	
such	
as	
RBD	
or	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
such	
as	
confusional	
arousal	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
may	
follow	
arousals	
from	
sleep	
or	
more	
rarely	
cause	
them	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
is	
highly	
prevalent	
.	

A	
recent	
cross	
-	
sectional	
epidemiologic	
study	
found	
the	
life-	
time	
prevalence	
of	
sleep	
talking	
to	
be	
66	
%	
and	
current	
prevalence	
—	
in	
the	
past	
three	
months	
—	
to	
be	
17	
%	
.	

There	
is	
no	
apparent	
sex	
difference	
.	

Onset	
and	
course	
are	
unknown	
.	

Complications	
usually	
arise	
when	
sleep	
talking	
is	
very	
frequent	
or	
loud	
or	
if	
the	
content	
is	
objectionable	
to	
others	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
is	
usually	
reported	
by	
the	
bed	
partner	
or	
someone	
sleeping	
in	
the	
same	
room	
or	
sleeping	
area	
as	
the	
affected	
individual	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
can	
disrupt	
the	
sleep	
of	
a	
bed	
partner	
,	
roommate	
,	
or	
others	
in	
a	
group	
-	
sleeping	
situation	
(	
such	
as	
college	
dormitories	
,	
military	
barracks	
,	
fire	
stations	
,	
or	
a	
tent	
while	
camping	
)	
.	

The	
content	
of	
sleep	
talking	
has	
not	
been	
shown	
to	
reflect	
actual	
prior	
waking	
behavior	
or	
memories	
.	

The	
sleep	
talker	
is	
rarely	
aware	
of	
his	
or	
her	
sleep	
talking	
.	

Nocturnal	
vocalization	
,	
including	
frank	
sleep	
talking	
,	
is	
often	
seen	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
RBD	
and	
subclinical	
RBD	
.	

A	
recent	
report	
notes	
that	
sleep	
talking	
may	
be	
a	
useful	
diagnostic	
marker	
for	
differentiating	
DLB	
from	
Alzheimer	
disease	
and	
other	
types	
of	
dementia	
.	

The	
vocalizations	
of	
RBD	
may	
be	
loud	
,	
emotional	
,	
profane	
,	
and	
associated	
with	
behav-	
iors	
that	
correlate	
with	
remembered	
dream	
mentation	
.	

Nocturnal	
seizures	
may	
be	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
vocalization	
that	
tends	
to	
be	
stereotypic	
.	

The	
vocalizations	
associated	
with	
sleep	
terrors	
are	
emotionally	
laden	
and	
associated	
with	
behaviors	
of	
intense	
arousal	
and	
agitation	
.	

In	
PTSD	
,	
increased	
vocalizations	
during	
sleep	
have	
been	
described	
.

Sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
are	
primarily	
characterized	
by	
relatively	
simple	
,	
usually	
stereotyped	
,	
movements	
that	
disturb	
sleep	
or	
its	
onset	
.	

Restless	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
syndrome	
(	
RLS	
)	
is	
an	
exception	
in	
that	
patients	ORGANISM
typically	
engage	
in	
walking	
or	
nonstereotypic	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movement	
to	
reduce	
leg	ORGAN
discomfort	
.	

However	
,	
RLS	
is	
closely	
associated	
with	
periodic	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movements	
(	
PLMs	
)	
,	
which	
are	
usually	
simple	
and	
stereotyped	
within	
a	
series	
.	

Nocturnal	
sleep	
disturbance	
or	
complaints	
of	
daytime	
sleepiness	
or	
fatigue	
are	
a	
prerequisite	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
a	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorder	
.	

For	
example	
,	
many	
normal	
sleepers	
exhibit	
episodes	
of	
periodic	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movements	
of	
sleep	
(	
PLMS	
)	
but	
have	
no	
complaint	
of	
a	
sleep	
disturbance	
,	
nor	
do	
they	
show	
a	
significant	
objective	
dis-	
turbance	
of	
their	
sleep	
as	
a	
result	
of	
the	
movements	
.	

Such	
persons	ORGANISM
should	
not	
be	
classi-	
fied	
as	
having	
periodic	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movement	
disorder	
(	
PLMD	
)	
,	
but	
instead	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
PLMS	
should	
simply	
be	
noted	
.	

Similar	
considerations	
relate	
to	
the	
distinction	
between	
rhythmic	
movement	
disorder	
and	
the	
presence	
of	
rhythmic	
movements	
.	

Body	
movements	
that	
disturb	
sleep	
also	
are	
seen	
in	
many	
other	
sleep	
disorder	
categories	
(	
e.g.	
,	
in	
parasomnias	
such	
as	
sleepwalking	
,	
sleep	
terrors	
,	
and	
rapid	
eye	ORGAN
movement	
(	
REM	
)	
sleep	
behavior	
disorder	
(	
RBD	
)	
)	
.	

However	
,	
these	
parasomnias	
differ	
from	
the	
simple	
ste-	
reotyped	
movements	
categorized	
as	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
in	
that	
they	
involve	
complex	
behaviors	
during	
the	
sleep	
period

but	
are

.	

Parasomnias	
are	
listed	
in	
a	
separate	
section	
from	
the	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
.	

Although	
the	
history	
may	
be	
diagnostic	
,	
polysomnography	
is	
sometimes	
necessary	
to	
make	
a	
firm	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
and	
distinguish	
them	
from	
parasomnias	
.	

In	
these	
cases	
,	
it	
is	
necessary	
to	
add	
all	
-	
night	
video	
recording	
to	
the	
poly-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
somnographic	
recording	
and	
to	
correlate	
the	
documented	
movements	
with	
the	
techni-	
cian	
’s	
description	
of	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
behavior	
and	
level	
of	
consciousness	
in	
order	
to	
estab-	
lish	
a	
diagnosis	
.	

There	
are	
some	
movement	
disorders	
that	
may	
occur	
during	
both	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

If	
the	
presentation	
during	
sleep	
is	
significantly	
different	
from	
that	
during	
wakefulness	
,	
or	
if	
the	
movement	
is	
entirely	
confined	
to	
sleep	
,	
then	
the	
move-

Essential	
Features	
RLS	
is	
a	
sensorimotor	
disorder	
characterized	
by	
a	
complaint	
of	
a	
strong	
,	
nearly	
irresist-	
ible	
urge	
to	
move	
the	
limbs	ORGAN
.	

This	
urge	
to	
move	
is	
often	
but	
not	
always	
accompanied	
by	
other	
uncomfortable	
sensations	
felt	
deep	
inside	
the	
limbs	ORGAN
or	
by	
a	
feeling	
that	
is	
simply	
difficult	
or	
impossible	
to	
describe	
.	

Although	
the	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
are	
most	
prominently	
affected	
,	
“	
restless	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
”	
is	
a	
misnomer	
,	
in	
that	
21	
%	
to	
57	
%	
of	
individuals	
with	
RLS	
describe	
some	
arm	
sensations	
.	

The	
most	
common

”	

About	
half

their	
RLS

“	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT

complaints

the

Clinical	
sleep

correlates	
with	
both	
severity	
of	
RLS	
and	
health	
impact	
of	
RLS	
.	

Some	
individuals	
with	
RLS	
may	
choose	
to	
work	
at	
night	
,	
thereby	
shifting	
quiet	
activities	
and	
their	
sleep	
schedule	
away	
from	
the	
circadian	
peak	
of	
their	
RLS	
symptoms

Periodic

movements	
can	
occur	
in	
sleep	
(	
PLMS	
)	
or	
wakeful-

PLMW	
occur	
during

frequently	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
waking

,	
disrupting

PLMS	
are	
frequently

Relevant

is	
the

Emerging

indicate	
that	
about	
one

Evidence	
in	
the	
literature

not

to	
support	
well

Early

onset	
RLS	
(	
prior

is	
more	
familial	
and	
associated

In	
addition	
,	
the	
classification	
of	
“

has	
been	
suggested	
when	
the

Demographics	
The	
overall	
prevalence

at	
5	
%	
to	
10	
%	
in

However	
,	
in

studies	
thus	
far	
indicate	
a	
lower	
prevalence	
.	

Prevalence	
is	
about	
twice	
as	
high	
in	
women	ORGANISM

In	
most

except	
in

Medications	
that	
may

include

An

The

in	
the

prevalence	
of

In

the	
prevalence	
of	
RLS	
is	
two

five	
times

Compared	
to	
patients	ORGANISM

those

Familial	
Patterns	
Early	
-	
onset	
RLS	
is	
highly	
familial	
,	
with	
40	
%	
to	
92	
%	
of	
cases	
reporting	
affected	
family	
members	
.	

High	
concordance	
rates	
are	
observed	
in	
monozygotic	
twins	
.	

The	
risk	
of	
RLS	
is	
two	
to	
six	
times	
greater	
for	
first

degree	
relatives	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
RLS	
than	
for	
those	
from	
the	
general	
population	
.	

Although	
an	
autosomal	
dominant	
model	
of	
RLS	
is	
sug-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
gested	
by	
many

,	
recent	
genomewide

studies

a

pattern	
.	

Linkage	
analyses	
have	
reported	
several	
different	
gene	
loci	
associated	
with	
RLS	
but	
,	
to	
date	
,	
no	
single	
causative	
gene	
.	

However	
,	
genomewide	
association	
studies	
have	
identified	
single	
nucleotide	
poly-	
morphisms	
in	
RLS	
,	
four	
of	
which	
have	
been	
replicated

and	
PTPRD	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
the	
relationship	
between	
familial	
RLS	
and	
these	
findings	
remains	
to	
be	
determined	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
of	
RLS	
symptoms	
occurs	
at	
all	
ages	
,	
from	
childhood	
to	
late	
adult	
life	
.	

Mean	
age	
of	
onset	
for	
familial	
RLS	
is	
in	
the	
third	
or	
fourth	
decade	
,	
with	
onset	
prior	
to	
age	
21	
years	
in	
about	
one	
third	
of	
cases	
.	

The	
clinical	
course	
of	
RLS	
differs	
based	
on	
age	
of	
onset	
.	

In	
early	
-	
onset	
RLS	
(	
before	
age	
45	
years	
)	
,	
slow	
progression	
of	
symptoms	
is	
found	
in	
about	
two	
thirds	
of	
cases	
.	

Most	
of	
the	
remaining	
one	
third	
report	
stable	
symp-	
toms	
over	
time	
,	
although	
remission	
has	
been	
described	
.	

In	
late	
-	
onset	
RLS	
,	
rapid	
pro-	
gression	
is	
typical	
and	
aggravating	
factors	
are	
common	
.	

Significant	
impairment	
of	
health	
-	
related	
quality	
of	
life	
(	
HRQoL	
)	
has	
been	
found	
in	
moderate	
to	
severe	
RLS	
.	

Both	
physical	
health	
and	
mental	
health	
scores	
have	
consis-	
tently	
been	
found	
to	
be	
lower	
for	
individuals	
with	
RLS	
,	
using	
standard	
QoL	
assess-	
ment	
tools	
.	

The	
HRQoL	
impairments	
are	
strongly	
associated	
with	
severity	
of	
RLS	
and	
remain	
after	
controlling	
for	
age	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
disease	
comorbidity	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
cancer	CANCER
,	
type	
2	
diabetes	
,	
or	
renal	ORGAN
failure	
who	
also	
have	
RLS	
have	
been	
shown	
to	
have	
poorer	
quality	
of	
life	
than	
those	
without	
RLS	
.	

Overall	
,	
RLS	
accounts	
for	
a	
major	
disease	
burden	
on	
those	
who	
suffer	
from	
it	
,	
demonstrated	
to	
be	
similar	
to	
or	
worse	
than	
that	
associated	
with	
osteoarthritis	
,	
congestive	
heart	ORGAN
failure	
,	
depression	
,	
Parkinson	CANCER
disease	CANCER
,	
or

.	

Large	
population	
-

studies	
have	
found	
positive	
associations	
between	
RLS	
and	
cardiovascular	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
disease	
,	
including	
coronary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
heart	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
and	
stroke	
.	

Repetitive	
surges	
in	
heart	ORGAN
rate	
and	
blood	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
pressure	
associated	
with	
PLMS	
are	
a	
potential	
mediator	
in	
the	
physiology	
of	
these	
relationships	
.	

Only	
limited	
mortality	
data	
are	
available	
,	
suggesting	
increased	
risk	
of	
mortality	
in	
women	ORGANISM
and	
in	
chronic

patients	ORGANISM
with	
RLS	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
The	
accurate	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adolescents	
requires	
understanding	
of	
developmental	
language	
and	
cognitive	
skills	
.	

Adequate	
verbal	
skills	
are	
needed	
for	
children	ORGANISM
to	
communicate	
the	
sensory	
component	
of	
RLS	
and	
description	
must	
be	
in	
“	
the	
child	
’s	
own	
words	
,	
”	
rather	
than	
by	
a	
parent	
or	
caretaker	
.	

For	
criterion	
A	
,	
children	ORGANISM
rarely	
use	
or	
understand	
the	
word	
“	
urge	
.	
”	

Instead	
they	
describe	
that	
their	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
“	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
need	
to	
”	
“	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
have	
to	
”	
or	
“	
got	
to	
”	
move	
.	

Descriptors	
for	
the	
discomfort	
include	
:	
bugs	
,	
ants	
,	
weird/	
funny	
feelings	
,	
tingle	
,	
wiggly	
,	
and	
shaky	
.	

Younger	
children	ORGANISM
often	
use	
the	
word	
“	
kick	
”	
rather	
than	
“	
move	
,	
”	
e.g.	
,	
“	
my	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
want	
to	
kick	
.	
”	

Similar	
to	
adults	
,	
children	ORGANISM
report	
arm	
involvement	
in	
almost	
half	
of	
cases	
.	

Sitting	
in	
class	
,	
lying	
in	
bed	
,	
reading	
a	
book	
,	
and	
riding	
in	
a	
car	
are	
situations	
where	
children	ORGANISM
report	
onset	
or	
worsening	
of	
their	
symp-	
toms	ORGANISM
.	

Relief	
is	
typically	
achieved	
by	
moving	
around	
,	
walking	
,	
rubbing	
,	
kicking	
,	
or	
distraction	
.	

Perhaps	
as	
a	
result	
of	
prolonged	
periods	
of	
sitting	
in	
class	
,	
two	
thirds	
of	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adolescents	
with	
RLS	
report	
daytime	
leg	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
sensations	
.	

Because	
of	
this	
,	
for	
diagnostic	
criterion	
A3	
(	
worse	
in	
the	
evening	
/	
night	
)	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
compare	
equal	
duration	
of	
sitting	
or	
lying	
down	
in	
the	
day	
to	
sitting	
or	
lying	
down	
in	
the	
evening/	
night	
.	

However	
,	
even	
with	
such	
comparisons	
,	
a	
significant	
subset	
of	
children	ORGANISM
do	
not	
report	
worsening	
at	
evening	
/	
night	
,	
yet	
meet	
all	
other	
diagnostic	
criteria	
and	
have	
sup-	CELL
portive	
features	
for	
RLS	
,	
including	
a	
positive	
family	
history	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
who	
are	
age	
six	
years	
or	
older	
and	
developmentally	
normal	
have	
been	
shown	
to	
report	
detailed	
,	
ade-	CELL
quate	
descriptors	
for	
RLS	
symptoms	
.	

For	
children	ORGANISM
who	
are	
too	
young	
to	
adequately	
describe	
RLS	
sensations	
or	
are	
developmentally	
delayed	
,	
a

the

,	
with	
full

symptomatology	
evident	
over	
time	
.	

Diagnosis	
by	
observational	
techniques	
has	
been	
suggested	
but	
not	
yet	
validated	
.	

The	
differential	
diagnosis	
of	
pediatric	
RLS	
includes	
positional	
discomfort	
,	
sore	
leg	TISSUE
muscles	TISSUE
,	
joint	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
/	
tendon	TISSUE
injury	
,	
and	
bruises	
,	
all	
of	
which	
are	
common	
mimics	
.	

In	
child-	
hood	
,	
RLS	
is	
frequently	
misdiagnosed	
as	
“	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
growing	
pains	
.	
”	

Four	
specific	
domains	
that	
are	
affected	
in	
pediatric	
RLS	
are	
sleep	
,	
daily	
activities	
,	
mood	
,	
and	
energy	
/	
vital-	
ity	
.	

Difficulties	
with	
sleep	
onset	
,	
sleep	
maintenance	
,	
and	
sleep	
quality	
are	
common	
.	

Negative	
influence	
of	
RLS	
on	
waking	
activities	
includes	
academic	
impact	
due	
to	
dis-	
ruption	
of	
schoolwork	
,	
homework	
,	
and	
ability	
to	
concentrate	
.	

Severity	
assessment	
of	
pediatric	
RLS	
has	
thus	
far	
been	
limited	
to	
simple	
measures	
of	
self	
-	
reported	
frequency	
and	
intensity	
.	

Because	
pediatric	
RLS	
is	
highly	
familial	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
RLS	
in	
a	
first	
-	
degree	
rela-	
tive	
helps	
to	
increase	
diagnostic	
certainty	
in	
childhood	
RLS	
.	

Similarly	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
PLMS	
or	
a	
history	
of	
PLMD	
is	
quite	
helpful	
in	
supporting	
an	
RLS	
diagnosis	
in	
chil-	
dren	
.	

As	
in	
adults	
,	
approximately	
70	
%	
of	
children	ORGANISM
with	
RLS	
demonstrate	
PLMS	
≥	
5/	
hour	
on	
a	
single	
night	
and	
nearly	
90	
%	
when	
multiple	
nights	
are	
sampled	
.	

PLMS	
≥	
5/	
hour	
are	
uncommon	
in	
pediatric	
normative	
samples	
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
pediatric	
RLS	
is	
comorbid	
with	
ADHD	CANCER
in	
about	
one	
fourth	
of	
cases	
,	
and	
,	
as	
in	
adults	
,	
higher	
rates	
of	
anxiety	
and	
depressive	
symptoms	
are	
found	
.	

RLS	
is	
common	
in	
pediatric	
chronic	
kidney	ORGAN
disease	
.	

Prevalence	
rates	
of	
RLS	
increase	
with	
age	
until	
late	
adulthood	
then	
stabilize	
or	
decrease	
slightly	
in	
the	
elderly	
.	

However	
,	
strong	
associations	
with	
anxiety	
,	
mood	
disorders	
,	
and	
decreased	
QoL	
measures	
remain	
in	
the	
elderly	
.	

Diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
RLS	
in	
the	
cog-	
nitive	
-	
impaired	
elderly	
have	
been	
suggested	
but	
not	
validated

Evidence

differences	
in

architecture	
.	

PLMS	
≥5	
/	
hour	
occur	
in	
70	
%	
to	
80	
%	
of	
adults	
with	
RLS	
on	
single	
-	
night	
testing	
but	
in	
>	
90	
%	
when	
multiple	
nights	
are	
sampled	
.	

In	
adult	
RLS	
,	
PLMS	
are	
more	
prominent	
during	
the	
first	
half	
of	
the	
night	
and	
vary	
in	
frequency	
from	
night	
to	
night	
.	

About	
one	
third	
of	
PLMS	
are	
associated	
with	
cortical	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
arousals	
,	
and	
most	
have	
associated	
autonomic	
arousals	
.	

PLMS	
are	
not	
influenced	
by	
placebo	
effect	
.	

PLMS	
arousals	
contribute	
to	
the	
primary	
RLS	
morbidity	
of	
sleep	
dis-	
turbance	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
RLS	
sensory	
symptoms	
impair	
return	
to	
sleep	
,	
and	
thereby	
result	
in	
more	
prolonged	
awakening	
.	

The	
Suggested	
Immobilization	
Test	
(	
SIT	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
)	
evaluates	
PLMW	
and	
related	
sensory	
com-	
ponents	
of	
RLS	
during	
resting	
wakefulness	
.	

A	
standard	
polysomnogram	
recording	
without	
respiratory	
measures	
is	
used	
for	
one	
hour	
before	
the	
usual	
bedtime	
while	
the	
subject	
sits	
comfortably	
awake	
and	
upright	
in	
bed	
with	
the	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
outstretched	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
.	

RLS	
diagnosis	
is	
supported	
by	
a	
finding	
of	
more	
than	
40	
PLMW	
/

.	

Activity	
monitors

and	
body

may	
be	
attached	
to	
the	
ankle	
or

to	
provide	
an	
alternate

of	
PLMs	CANCER
.	

Recordings	
assess	
the	
frequency	
and

of	
PLMs	CANCER
from

,	
typically	
over	
three

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
differentiation	
of	
RLS	
from	
other	
conditions	
that	
may	
have	
characteristics	
of	
RLS	
is	
essential	
,	
because	
approximately	
40	
%	
of	
individuals	
without	
RLS	
will	
report	
some	
urge	
or	
need	
to	
move	
the	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
while	
at	
rest	
.	

Fulfilling

better	
with	
movement	
)	
and	
A3	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
(	
worse

the	
evening	
/

)	
improves	
specificity	
for	
an	
RLS	
diagnosis	
to	
only	
about	
70	
%	
,	
based	
on	
studies	
that	
have	
used	
structured	
diagnostic	
interviews	
.	

However	
,	
differentiating	
RLS	
from	
leg	CANCER
cramps	CANCER
and	
positional	
discomfort	
improves	
specificity	
to	
94	
%	
,	
emphasizing	
the	
importance	
of	
differential	
diagnosis	
.

,	
and	
anxiety	
-

.	

Neuroleptic	
-	
induced	
akathisia	
differs	
from	
RLS	
in	
that	
akathisia	
is	
associated	
with	
the	
need	
to	
move	
the	
entire	
body	
and	
occurs	
in	
association	
with	
use	
of	
dopamine	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
receptor	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
antagonists	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
.	

Painful	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
and	
moving	
toes	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
have	
neither	
a	
clear	
circadian	
pattern	
nor	
the	
sense	
of	
an	
urge	
to	
move	
.	

Pain	
involving	
the	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
occurs	
with	
numerous	
conditions	
,	
including	
arthritis	
,	
vascular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
problems	
,	
sports	
/	
orthopedic	
injuries	
,	
and	
neuropathy	
.	

These	
pains	
can	
have	
a	
nocturnal	
presentation	
and	
may	
be	
worse	
at	
rest	
,	
but	
improvement	
with	
movement	
either	
does	
not	
occur	
or	
entails	
more	
exercise	
than	
simple	
movement	
of	
the	
leg	ORGAN
.	

The	
urge	
to	
move	
,	
if	
present	
at	
all	
,	
usually	
stems	
from	
awareness	
that	
movement	
produces	
relief	
rather	
than	
the	
strong	
primary	
urgency	
of	
movement	
felt	
with	
RLS	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
pain	
,	
however	
,	
does	
not	
exclude	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	
,	
because	
about	
50	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
RLS	
report	
their	
RLS	
symptoms	
as	
painful	
.	

Although	
it	
is	
important	
that	
RLS	
symptoms	
not	
be	
attributable	
solely	
to	
another	
medical	
or	
behavioral	
condition	
,	
it	
should	
also	
be	
appreciated	
that	
any	
of	
these	
mimics	
can	
occur	
in	
an	
individual	
who	
also	
has	
RLS	
.	

For	
example	
,	
some	
subjects	
may	
have	
both	
RLS	
and	
leg	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
cramps	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
.	

When	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	
is	
not	
certain	
,	
evaluation	
for	
the	
supportive	
features	
such	
as	
the	
presence	
of	
PLMS	
or	
a	
family	
history	
of	
RLS	
may	
be	
helpful	
.	

Diagnostic	
interviews	
that	
include	
differential	
diagnosis	
have	
been	
validated	
for	
RLS	
.	

These	
demonstrate	
sensitivity	
and	
specificity	
of	
>	
90	
%	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

The	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	
relies	
on	
the	
subjective	
report	
of	
sensory	
symptoms	
that	
lie	
outside	
the	
range	
of	
common	
sensory	
experience	
.	

Many	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
difficulty	
describing	
the	
sensations	
.	

Further	
studies	
of	
the	
biological	
bases	
for	
RLS	
may	
lead	
to	
better	
classification	
of	
RLS	
and	
possibly	
to	
objective	
tests	
for	
diagnosis	
.	

Iron	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
dopa-	
mine	
,	
and	
genetic	
research	
hold	
particular	
promise	
.	

Additional	
epidemiological	
and	
genetic	
studies	
outside	
the	
US	
and	
Europe	
are	
needed	
to	
explore	
apparent	
population	
differences	
.	

The	
diagnostic	
standards	
and	
severity	
assessment	
for	
children	ORGANISM
and	
cogni-	
tively	
impaired	
adults	
require	
further	
development	
.	

Clarification	
of	
the	
natural	
course	
and	
potential	
exacerbating	
factors	
is	
needed	
.	

Better	
understanding	
of	
RLS	
with	
comor-	CANCER
bidities	
such	
as	
mood	
disorders	
and	
attention	
deficit	
hyperactivity	
disorder	
might	
lead	
to	
improved	
outcomes	
in	
those	
disorders	
.	

Further	
evaluation	
of	
long	
-	
term	
complica-	
tions	
is	
important	
,	
including	
clarification	
of	
associations	
with	
hypertension	
,	
cardiovas-	
cular	
disease	
,	
and	
stroke	
.

Notes

The

Index	
must	
be	
interpreted	
in	
the	
context	
of	
a	
patient	ORGANISM
’s	
sleep	
related	
complaint	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
normative	
values	
greater	
than	
five	
per	
hour	
have	
been	
found	
in	
studies	
that	
did	
not	
exclude	
respiratory	
event	
-	
related	
arousals	
(	
using	
sensitive	
respiratory	
monitoring	
)	
and	
other	
causes	
for	
PLMS	
.	

Data	
suggest	
a	
partial	
overlap	
of	
PLMS	
Index	
values	
between	
symptomatic	
and	
asymptomatic	
individuals	
,	
emphasizing	
the	
importance	
of	
clinical	
context	
over	
an	
absolute	
cutoff	
value	
.	
.	

If	
PLMS	
are	
present	
without	
clinical	
sleep	
disturbance	
or	
daytime	
impairment	
,	
the	
PLMS	
can	
be	
noted	
as	
a	
polysomnographic	
finding	
,	
but	
criteria	
are	
not	
met	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	
.	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
insomnia	
or	
hypersomnia	
with	
PLMS	
is	
not	
sufficient	
to	
establish	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	
.	

Studies	
have	
shown	
that	
in	
most	
cases	
the	
cause	
of	
the	
accompanying	
insomnia	
or	
hypersomnia	
is	
something	
other	
than	
the	
PLMS	
.	

To	
establish	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	
,	
it	
is	
essential	
to	
establish	
a	
reasonable	
cause	
-	
and	
-	
effect	
relationship	
between	
the	
insomnia	
or	
hypersomnia	
and	
the	
PLMS	
.	

This	
requires	
that	
other	
causes	
of	
insomnia	
such	
as	
anxiety	
or	
other	
causes	
of	
hypersomnia	
such	
as	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
or	
narcolepsy	
are	
ruled	
out	
.	

PLMS	
are	
common	
,	
but	
PLMD	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
rare	
in	
adults	
.	
.	

PLMD	
can	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
in	
the	
context	
of	
RLS	
,	
narcolepsy	
,	
untreated	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
,	
or	
REM	
sleep	
behavior	
disorder	
;	
PLMS	
occur	
commonly	
in	
these	
conditions	
but	
the	
sleep	
complaint	
is	
more	
readily	
ascribed	
to	
the	
accompanying	
disorder	
.	

The	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	
takes	
precedence	
over	
that	
of	
PLMD	
when	
potentially	
sleep-	
disrupting	
PLMS	
occur	
in	
the	
context	
of	
RLS	
.	

In	
such	
cases	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	
is	
made	
and	
the	
PLMS	
are	
noted	
.	
.	

When	
it	
is	
reasonably	
certain	
that	
the	
PLMS	
have	
been	
induced	
by	
medication	
,	
and	
full	
criteria	
for	
PLMD	
are	
met	
,	
it	
is	
preferred	
that	
the	
more	
specific	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	
be	
used	
,	
rather	
than	
“	
Sleep	
related	
movement	
disorder	
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
.	
”	

Essential	
Features	
PLMD	
is	
characterized	
by	
periodic	
episodes	
of	
repetitive	
,	
highly	
stereotyped	
limb	
movements	
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
(	
PLMS	
)	
,	
in	
conjunction	
with	
clinical	
sleep	
dis-	
turbance	
or	
fatigue	
that	
can	
not	
be	
accounted	
for	
by	
another	
primary	
sleep	
disorder	
or	
other	
etiology	
.	

PLMS	
occur	
most	
frequently	
in	
the	
lower	
extremities	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

They	
typically	
involve	
exten-	
sion	
of	
the	
big	
toe	
,	
often	
in	
combination	
with	
partial	
flexion	
of	
the	
ankle	
,	
the	
knee	TISSUE
,	
and	
sometimes	
,	
the	
hip	
.	

Similar	
movements	
can	
occur	
in	
the	
upper	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
limbs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
.	

Individual	
movements	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
autonomic	
arousal	
,	
a	
cortical	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
arousal	
,	
or	
an	
awakening	
.	

Typically	
,	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
is

An	
arousal	
may	
precede	
,	
coincide	
with	
,	
or	
follow	
the	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movement	
,	
suggesting	
that	
a	
central	
generator	
may	
give	
rise	
to	
both	
the	
periodic

and	
the	
related	
sleep

A

unrefresh-	
ing

the	
PLMS	
is	
needed	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	
.	

These	
symp-	
toms	ORGANISM
have	
most	
consistently	
been	
associated	
with	
PLMS	
,	
and	
the	
presence	
of	
these	
clinical	
symptoms	
differentiates	
PLMD	
from	
asymptomatic	
PLMS	
.	

Although	
exces-	
sive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
has	
been	
reported	
with	
PLMD	
in	
the	
past	
,	
newer	
data

.	

If	
the	
only	
complaint	
is	
sleep	
disruption	
for	
the	
bed

,	
then	
PLMD	
should	
not	
be

the

can	
be	
noted

The

index	
should	
exceed	
five	
per

in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
15	
per	
hour	
in	
adult	
cases	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	
.	

This	
is	
based	
on	
substantial	
normative	
data	
in	
children	ORGANISM
.	

In	
adults	
,	
there	
is	
a	
significant	
increase	
in	
sleep	
disturbance	
symptoms	
with	
PLMS	
>	
15	
/	
hour	
.	

The	
PLMS	
and	
the	
symptoms	
of	
sleep	
disturbance	
or	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
should	
not	
be	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
etiology	
.	

Most	
important	
in	
the	
differential	
diagnosis	
are	
RLS	
,	
REM	
sleep	
behavior	
disorder	
(	
RBD	
)	
,	
and	
narcolepsy	
.	

Research	
studies	
indicate	
that	
five	
or	
more	
PLMS	
per	
hour	
occur	
in	
80	
%	
to	
90	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
RLS	
,	
in	
about	
70	
%	
with	
RBD	
,	
and	
in	
45	
%	
to	
65	
%	
with	
narcolepsy

In	
RBD	
,	
PLMS	
are	
often	
present	
without	
arousals	
during	
nonrapid

sleep	
but	
can	
also	
con-	
tinue	
into	
REM

,	
which	
is	
unusual	
in	
all	
other	
settings	
.	

If	
significant	
daytime	
sleep-	
iness	
and	
PLMS	
are	
present	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	
should	
be	
considered	
.	

PLMD	
should	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
when	
criteria	
for	
one	
of	
these	
three	
disorders	
is	
met	
.	

However	
,	
the	
primary	
disorder	
“	
with	
PLMS	
”	
can	
be	
specified	
(	
e.g.	
,	
“	
RLS	
with	
PLMS	
”	
)	
.	

A	
sensitive	
technique	
,	
such	
as	
pressure	
transducer	
airflow	
monitoring	
or	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
manometry	
,	
should	
be	
used	
to	
monitor	
breathing	
during	
polysomnography	
to	
rea-	
sonably	
exclude	
sleep	
related	
breathing	
disorders	
(	
SRBDs	
)	
as	
the	
direct	
cause	
of	
the	
PLMS	
.	

When	
independent	
PLMS	
are	
present	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
SRBDs	
,	
a	
separate	
diag-	
nosis	
of	
PLMD	
may	
be	
considered	
if	
the	
PLMS	
persist	
despite	
adequate	
treatment	
of	
the	
SRBD	
and	
otherwise	
unexplained	
sleep	
disturbance	
remains	
.	

Ideally	
,	
polysom-	
nography	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	
should	
be	
performed	
after	
the	
biologic	
effect	
of	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
,	
such	
as	
an	
antidepressant	
known	
to	
induce	
or	
aggravate

In	
children	ORGANISM

a

is	
common

A

Although

to	
benzodiazepines	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
benzodiazepine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
responsiveness	
is	
not	
support-

Demographics	
Although

is	
thought	
to	
be	
rare	
,	
the	
exact	
prevalence	
is	
not	
known	
.	

PLMD	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
both	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adults	
.	

PLMS	
>	
5

are	
very	
uncommon	
in	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adults	
younger	
than	
the	
age	
of	
40	
years	
,	
but	
then	
increase	
markedly	
with	
advancing	
age	
,	
occurring	
in	
over	
45	
%	
of	
the	
elderly	
.	

The	
population	
prevalence	
of	
PLMS	
>	
15	
/

has	
been	
estimated	
at	
7.6	
%	
of	
18-

65	
-	
year	
-	
olds	
,	
with	
4.5	
%	
of	
the	
total	
population	
also	
reporting	
sleep	
disturbance	
or	
excessive	
sleepiness	
.	

However	
,	
RLS	
and	
medication	
-	
induced	
PLMS	
were	
not	
exclusionary	
criteria	
in	
this	
popula-	
tion	
,	
suggesting	
much	
lower	
rates	
for	
PLMD	
.	

The	
increase	
in	
PLMS	
with	
age	
may	
occur	
as	
a	
partial	
expression	
of	
familial	
or	
genetic	
factors	
associated	
with	
RLS	
,	
based	
on	
data	
that	
show	
very	
little	
increase	
in	
PLMS	
with	
age	
when	
individuals	
who	
have	
RLS	
or	
first

with	
RLS	
are	
excluded	
.	

PLMS

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
A	
positive	
family	
history	
of	
RLS	
confers	
increased	
risk	
for	
PLMS	
and	
PLMD	
.	

The	
genetic	
variants	
noted	
below	
may	
be	
a	
mediator	
of	
this	
risk	
.	

Precipitation

aggrava-	
tion	
of

has	
been

Familial	
Patterns	

The	
familial	
pattern	
of	
PLMD	
has	
not	
been	
studied	
in	
detail	
.	

Families	
with	
RLS	
have	
been	
found	
to	
include	
first	
-	
degree	
relatives	
without	
RLS	
but	
with	
increased	
rates	
of	
PLMS	
or	
PLMD	
,	
raising	
the	
possibility	
that	
PLMD	
is	
an	
attenuated	
manifestation	
or	
a	
precursor	
to	
RLS	
.	

The	
gene

and	
MEIS1	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
which	
were	
found	
in	
genome-

appear	
to	
influence	
the

,	
and	
Complications	
Although	
the

,	
PLMD	
occurs	
in	
both	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adults	
,	
with	
onset	
as	
early	
as	
infancy	
.	

The	
natural	
history	
has	
not	
been	
described	
in	
detail	
,	
but	
some	
pediatric	
cases	
of	
PLMD	
progress	
to	
RLS	
.

and

are

Impaired

has	
been

with	
a	
higher	
risk	
of

Developmental	
Issues	
Given	
the	
low	
background	
rates	
of	
PLMS	
in	
children	ORGANISM
,	
PLMD	
has	
emerged	
as	
a	
useful	
diagnostic	
category	
in	
pediatric	
sleep	
medicine	
.	

Pediatric	
PLMD	
has	
important	

clini-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

cal	

and	
polysomnographic	
correlates	
that	
are	
comparable	
in	
severity	
to	
pediatric	
OSA	
.	

However	
,	
PLMS	
and	
PLMD	
normative	
data	
remain	
sparse	
for	
children	ORGANISM
younger	
than	
two	
years	
.	

In	
the	
elderly	
,	
frequent	
occurrence	
of	
other	
conditions	
that	
can	
account	
for	
sleep	
dis-	

turbance	
and	
fatigue	
makes	
application	
of	
PLMD	
criteria	
difficult	
,	
even	
though	
PLMS	
are	
common	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Dopaminergic	
impairment	
has	
been	
implicated	
in	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
PLMS	
and	
PLMD	
.	

The	
study	
of	
PLMS	
in	
RLS	
and	
in	
children	ORGANISM
also	
suggests	
genetic	
diathesis	
and	
iron	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
status	
as	
factors	
.	

Cyclic	
alternating	
pattern	
,	
a	
marker	
of	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
,	
is	
increased	
in	
individuals	
with	
PLMS	
and	
may	
influence	
the	
periodicity	
of	
PLMS	
.	

Cortical	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
arousals	
can	
precede	
,	
coincide	
with	
,	
or	
follow	
PLMS	
,	
indicating	
that	
PLMS	
do	
not	
cause	
the	
arousals	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
PLMS	
can	
be	
dissociated	
from	
arousals	
pharma-	
cologically	
,	
suggesting	
an	
indirect	
relation	
,	
possibly	
mediated	
by	
a	
central	
generator	
.	

The	
autonomic	
arousals	
associated	
with	
PLMS	
are	
characterized	
by	
significant	
heart	ORGAN
rate	
and	
blood	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
pressure	
surges	
,	
a	
mechanism	
for	
possible	
increased	
cardiovascular

risk	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
PLMS	
can	
appear	
immediately	
with	
the	
onset	
of	
stage

,	
are	
frequent	
during

decrease	
in	
frequency	
in

,	
and	
are	
usually	
absent	
during

.	

PLMS	
typically	
occur	
in	
discrete	
episodes	
that	
last	
from	
a	
few	
minutes	
to	
an	
hour	
.	

Both	
lower	
limbs	ORGAN

be	
monitored	
for	
the	
presence	
of	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movements	
.	

Movements	
of

The

may	
affect

both	
of	
the

limbs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
,	
but	
not	
neces-

a	
symmetric

Specific	
scoring	
criteria	
for	
PLMS	
are	
described	
in	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of

Self

or	
parental	
reports	
for

have	
not	
been	
found	
to	
have	
sufficient	
specificity	
or	
sensitivity	
to	
replace	
objective	
testing	
for	
PLMS	
.	

Care	
must	
be	
taken	
to	
discriminate	
PLMS	
from	
other	
movements	
such	
as	
a	
simple	
change	
in	
body	
position	
,	
stretching	
of	
a	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
,	
or	
a	
muscle	ORGAN

.	

PLMS	
are	
longer	
in	
duration	
than	
myoclonic	
jerks	
,	
which	
,	
by	
definition	
,	
are	
typically	
50

150	
millisec-

during	
sleep	
(	
ALMA	
)	
should	
not	
be	
included	
in	
the	
PLMS

.	

PLMS	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
electroencephalographic	
(	
cortical	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
)	
arousals	
or	
with	
awakenings	
.	

Autonomic

have	
been	
shown	
to	
be	
more

In	
some	
cases	
,	
periodic	
arousals	
may	
persist	
even	
though	
the	
PLMS	
have	
subsided	
.	

The	
arousals	
are	
typically	
more	
difficult	
to	
measure	
than	
are	
the	
PLMS	
,	
and	
their	
clinical	
significance	
is	
a	
topic	
of	
ongoing	
debate	
.	

As	
with	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	
,	
the	
associated	
cortical	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
arousal	
index	
has	
not	
proven	
more	
useful	
than	
the	
PLMS	
index	
in	
making	
clini-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
cal	
decisions	
.	

Although	
a	
subjective	
report	
of	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
is	
present	
in	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
PLMD	
,	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
measured	
by	
MSLT	
has	
not	
been	
found	
to	
be	
consistently	
abnormal	
or	
to	
correlate	
with	
the	
PLMS	
cortical	
arousal	
index	
.	

The	
movements	
should	
be	
reported	
as	
an	
index	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
,	
called	
the	
PLMS	
index	
.	

The	
PLMS	
index	
is	
the	
number	
of	
periodic	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movements	
per	
hour	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
,	
as	
determined	
by	
polysomnography	
.	

The	
PLMS	
arousal	
index	
is	
the	
number	
of	
PLMS	
associated	
with	
a	
cortical	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
arousal	
,	
expressed	
per	
hour	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
.	

Other	
parameters	
for	
the	
description	
of	
PLMS	
include	
periodicity	
index	
,	
intermove-	
ment	
interval	
distribution	
,	
and	
time	
of	
night	
distribution	
.	

These	
features	
have	
been	
shown	
to	
help	
differentiate	
PLMS	
patterns	
in	
different	
conditions	
(	
e.g.	
,	
a	
finding	
of	
the	
highest

in	
the	
essential	
features	
section	
,	
PLMD	
is	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
exclusion	
and	
it	
is	
important	
to	
differentiate	
it	
from	
other	
conditions	
in	
which	
PLMS	
occur	
,	
particularly	
RLS	
,	
RBD	
,	
narcolepsy	
,	
and

Dopaminergic

for

have	
been	
proposed

Sleep	
starts	
(	
hypnic

need	
to	
be	
differentiated	
from	
PLMS	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
typically	
are	
limited	
to	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
,	
are	
not	
periodic	
,	
and	
are	
briefer	
(	
20

100	
milliseconds	
)	
than	
PLMS	
.	

Normal

typically	
occurs	
in

and	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
bursts	
of

EMG	ORGAN
twitches	
are	
more	
variable	
in	
duration	
and	
do	
not	
have	
the

of

.	

Fragmentary	
myoclonus	
is	
characterized	
by	
EMG	CANCER
activity	
that	
is	
briefer	
(	
75	
to	
150	
milliseconds	
)	
,	
more	
variable	
in	
duration	
,	
less	
periodic	
than	
PLMS	
,	
and	
has	
little	
or	
no	
associated	
visible	
movement	
.	

Also	
,	
PLMS	
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
movements	
associated	
with	
nocturnal	
epileptic	
seizures	
and	
myoclonic	
epilepsy	
and	
from	
a	
number	
of	
forms

as	
in

However	
,	
in	
these	
disorders	
,	
the	
involuntary

are	
prominent

often	
do

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
has	
been	
controversy	
over	
the	
clinical	
significance	
of	
PLMS	
.	

To	
date	
,	
the	
inter-	
pretation	
of	
most	
studies	
has	
been	
confounded	
by	
multiple	
factors	
that	
include	
:	
impre-	
cise	
diagnostic	
criteria	
;	
confusion	
between	
PLMS	
and	
PLMD	
;	
inadequate	
monitoring	
for	
subtle	
SRBDs	
;	
a	
lack	
of	
consideration	
of	
medications	
known	
to	
induce	
,	
worsen	
,	
or	
suppress	
PLMS	
;	
and	
inadequate	
measurement	
of	
the	
known	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
vari-	
ability	
of	
PLMS	
.	

Newer	
respiratory	
monitoring	
techniques	
for	
polysomnography	
and	
the	
use	
of	
actigraphy	
monitors	
over	
several	
nights	
should	
help	
address	
a	
number	
of	
these	
issues	
.	

The	
role	
of	
associated	
arousals	
in	
relation	
to	
clinical	
symptoms	
is	
yet	
to	
be	
determined	
,	
but	
the	
appreciation	
of	
autonomic	
arousals	
as	
well	
as	
cortical	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
arousals	
might	
be	
critical	
.	

It	
is	
possible	
that	
PLMS	
are	
a	
measurable	
marker	
of	
unstable	
sleep	
,	
related	
to	
genetic	
diathesis	
and	
dopaminergic	
impairment	
.

groups	
during	
which	
there

sometimes	
also	
by

Associated	
Features	
The

The	
pain	
from	
the	
cramp	
itself	
and	
from	
the	
activities	
used	
to	
relieve	
it	
commonly	
disturb	
sleep	
onset	
or	
cause	
an	
awakening	
from

.	

Often	
the	
presenting	
complaint	
is	
insomnia	
,	
at

Tenderness	
and	
discomfort	
in	
the

may	
persist	
for	
several	
hours	
after	
the

.	

Persisting	
discomfort	
after

Pathophysiology	
Many

to	
be	
idiopathic

Although

they

Some	
nocturnal

cramps	CANCER
are	
relieved	
by	
stretching	
the

Electrophysiologic	
recordings	
show	
that	
the

start	
with	
spontaneous

(	
considerably	
more	
than

sometimes	
confused	
with

related	
leg	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
cramps	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
because	
both	
can	
present	
with	
leg	ORGAN
discomfort	
during	
the	
sleep	
period	
and	
RLS	
patients	ORGANISM
sometimes	
complain	
of	
a

However	
,	
if

meet	
the

criteria

do	
not	
describe	
an	
actual

,	
the	
diagnosis	
should	
be	
RLS

Because	
leg	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION

can	
mimic	
RLS	
and	
meet	
all	
the	
criteria	
for	
RLS	
,	
the	
description	
of	
an	
actual

is	
a	
critical	
differentiating	
factor

A	
leg	ORGAN

is	
also	
a	
much	
briefer	
event	
than	
the	
typical

Their

,	
as	
described	
in

Essential	
Features	
Bruxism	
is	
defined	
as	
a	
repetitive	
jaw	CANCER
-	CANCER
muscle	CANCER
activity	
characterized	
by	
clenching	
or	
grinding	
of	
the	
teeth	ORGAN
and/or	
by	
bracing	
or	
thrusting	
of	
the	
mandible	ORGAN
.	

Bruxism	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
has	
been	
divided	
into	
its	
two	
distinct	
circadian	
manifestations	
:	
sleep	
bruxism	
and	
awake	
bruxism	
.	

In	
sleep	
,	
jaw	CANCER
muscle	CANCER
contractions	CANCER
are	
frequently	
repeated	
over	
time	
and	
are	
termed	
rhythmic	
masticatory	CANCER
muscle	CANCER
activity	
(	
RMMA	
)	
.	

These	
contractions	
can	
take	
two	
forms	
on	
electromyographic	
traces	
:	
a	
series	
of	
repetitive	
activity	
(	
phasic	
muscle	ORGAN
contractions	
)	
or	
isolated	
sustained	
jaw	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
clenching	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
(	
tonic	
contractions	
)	
.	

These	
contractions	
during	
sleep	
produce	
tooth	ORGAN
-	
grinding	
sounds	
and	
are	
referred	
to	
as	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
.	

Sleep	
related	
bruxism	
can	
lead	
to	
abnormal	
tooth	ORGAN
wear	
,	
tooth	ORGAN
pain	
,	
jaw	CANCER
muscle	CANCER
pain	
,	
and	
temporal	
headache	
.	

Severe	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
may	
also	
result	
in	
sleep	
dis-	
ruption	
.	

This	
may	
involve	
not	
only	
the	
individual	
affected	
,	
but	
also	
the	
bed	
partner	
,	
because	
the	
sounds	
made	
by	
the	
friction	
of	
the	
teeth	ORGAN
are	
usually	
perceived	
as	
being	
unpleasant	
and	
can	
be	
quite	
loud	
and	
disturbing	
to	
those	
nearby	
.	

The	
disorder	
is	
typically	
brought	
to	
dental	
or	
medical	
attention	
because	
of	
the	
tooth	ORGAN
damage	
,	
pain	
,	
or	
disturbing	
sounds	
.	

Less	
commonly	
,	
it	
may	
present	
as	
a	
cause	
of	
dis-	
turbed	
sleep	
.	

Young	
and	
otherwise	
healthy	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
appear	
to	
have	
normal	
sleep	
structure	
and	
homeostasis	
.	

The	
majority	
of	
RMMA	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
epi-	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
sodes	
during	
sleep	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
sleep	
arousal	
.	

Jaw	TISSUE

in	
the	
masseter	TISSUE
and	
temporalis	TISSUE
muscle	TISSUE
regions	
,	
morning	
headache	
,	
or	
fatigue	
can	
arise	
due	
to	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Additional	
symptoms	
include	
a	
variety	
of	
unpleasant	
muscle	ORGAN
and	
tooth	ORGAN
sensations	
,	
lim-	
itation	
of	
jaw	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
movements	
,

,	
and	
temporal	
/	
tension	
headaches	
.	

Tooth	ORGAN
wear	
,	
fractured	
teeth	ORGAN
,	
and	
buccal	ORGAN
lacerations	
also	
can	
occur	
.	

These	
symptoms	
may	
be	
induced	
by	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
,	
but	
the	
connection	
may	
not	
be	
apparent	
to	
the	
affected	
indi-	
vidual	
and	
diagnostic	
discrimination	
is	
weak	
.	

Headaches	
are	
frequently	
reported	
by	
both	
adults	
and	
children	ORGANISM
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
.	

The	
headache	
usually	
involves	
the	
temporal	
regions	
and	
it	
has	
the	
charac-	
teristics	
of	
a	
tension	
headache	
.	

It	
is	
reported	
either	
in	
the	
morning	
(	
more	
frequently	
)	
or	
during	
the	
day	
(	
with	
wake	
bruxism	
)	
.	

The	
estimated	
OR	
for	
headache	
in	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
is	
>	
4	
compared	
to	
controls	
.	

There	
is	
high	
individual	
variability	
in	
the	
intensity	
and	
duration	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
,	
but	
in	
the	
most	
severe	
cases	
,	
hundreds	
of	
events	
can	
occur	
during	
a	
night	
of	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
no	
direct	
relationship	
has	
been	
observed	
between	
the	
severity	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
and	
the	
appearance	
of	
clinical	
signs	
and	
symptoms	
.	

Indeed	
,	
indi-	
viduals	
with	
a	
mild	
to	
moderate	
index	
of	
sleep	
bruxism	
(	
2	
to	
4	
RMMA	
episodes	
/	
hour	
of	
sleep	
)	
have	
a	
higher	
risk	
of	
reporting	
painful	
jaw	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
upon	
awakening	
(	
OR	
3.9	
)	
,	
and	
masticatory	TISSUE
muscle	TISSUE
fatigue	
(	
OR	
5.1	
)	
compared	
to	
individuals	
with	
severe	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
(	
>	
4	
RMMA	
episodes	
/	
hour	
of	
sleep	
)	
.	

Psychosocial	
components	
may	
also	
be	
linked	
to	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
.	

The	
psycholog-	
ical	
assessment	
of	
otherwise	
healthy	
adults	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
suggests	
a	
cor-	
relation	
(	
not	
yet	
proven	
as	
a	
causality	
)	
between	
bruxism	
and	
stress	
/	
anxiety	
.	

Moreover	
,	
both	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adults	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
seem	
to	
have	
higher	
scores	
in	
stress	
,	
anxiety	
,	
and	
psychiatric	
scales	
compared	
to	
control	
individuals	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Sleep	
related	
bruxism	
without	
clear	
cause	
is	
termed	
primary	
or	
idiopathic	
.	

Forms	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
associated	
with	
the	
use	
of	
psychoactive	
medications	
,	
recreational	
drugs	
,	
or	
a	
variety	
of	
medical	
disorders	
(	
e.g.	
,	
Parkinson	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
disease	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
RBD	
,	
Down	
syndrome	
)	
are	
defined	
as	
secondary	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
.	

Treatment	
-	
induced	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
is	
also	
termed	
iatrogenic	
.	

Although	
the	
primary	
form	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
is	
most	
often	
reported	
in	
healthy	
children	ORGANISM
and	
adults	
,	
secondary	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
is	
observed	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
cere-	
bral	
palsy	
and	
mental	
retardation	
and	
in	
adult	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
abnormal	
movements	
such	
as	
in	
oromandibular	
myoclonus	
/	
facio	CELL
-	CELL
mandibular	CELL
myoclonus	
or	
with	
sleep	
related

disorders	
.	

OSA	
and	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
commonly	
co	
-	
occur	
.	

Tooth	ORGAN
grinding	
and	
clenching	
also	
can	
occur	
during	
wakefulness	
,	
as	
an	
oral	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
parafunc-	
tional	
activity	
known	
as	
awake	
bruxism	
.	

Awake	
bruxism	
is	
considered	
a	
different	
dis-	
order	
,	
probably	
with	
different	
diagnostic	
criteria	
and	
pathophysiology	
;	
its	
association	
with	
sleep	
bruxism	
is	
still	
under	
debate	
.	

However	
,	
the	
two	
oral	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
activities	
may	
coexist	
in	
the	
same	
individual	
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
,	
based	
on	
reports	
from	
parents	
or	
sleep	
partner	
,	
is	
highest	
in	
childhood	
(	
approximately	
14	
%	
to	
17	
%	
)	
and	
then	
decreases	
over	
the	
life	
span	
.	

In	
teenagers	
to	
young	
adults	
,	
prevalence	
is	
in	
the	
12	
%	
range	
.	

In	
young	
to	
middle	
-	
aged	
adults	
,	
it	
is	
approximately	
8	
%	
but	
as	
little	
as	
3	
%	
in	
older	
persons	ORGANISM
.	

The	
reported	
reduction	
in	
tooth	ORGAN
grinding	
in	
the	
elderly

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Predisposing	
factors	
include	
personality	
types	
;	
for	
example	
,	
individuals	ORGANISM
who	
are	
highly	
motivated	
or	
characteristically	
maintain	
high	
vigilance	
may	
have	
an	
increased	
preva-	
lence	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
.	

Genetic	
predisposition	
is	
plausible	
but	
still	
under	
investigation	
.	

As	
described	
below	
,	
there	
is	
some	
familial	
predisposition	
due	
to	
environmental	
or	
shared	
genetic	
factors	
.	

Recently	
,	
a	
serotonin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
gene	
was	
described	
in	
bruxism	
patients	ORGANISM
but	
the	
absence	
of	
distinction	
between	
the	
wake	
and	
sleep	
forms	
in	
this	
report	
preclude	
firm	
conclusions	
.	

Precipitating	
factors	
can	
include	
anxiety	
related	
to	
current	
life	
events	
,	
tasks	
requir-	
ing	
high	
levels	
of	
performance	
,	
and	
repetitive	
tasks	
with	
short	
deadlines	
.	

The	
use	
of	
cigarettes	
or	
caffeine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
in	
the	
hours	
before	
sleep	
also	
can	
contribute	
to	
the	
occur-	ORGAN
rence	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
(	
probably	
due	
to	
the	
increased	
arousals	
and	
sleep	
instability	
)	
.	

The	
role	
of	
dental	
morphologic	
“	
defects	
”	
(	
occlusal	
interferences	
)	
remains	
controver-	
sial	CELLULAR_COMPONENT
in	
the	
etiology	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
.	

Tooth	ORGAN
contacts	
do	
not	
usually	
set	
in	
motion	
a	
bruxism	
episode	
;	
they	
are	
usually	
late	
in	
the	
series	
of	
events	
occurring	
during	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
/	

tooth	ORGAN
grinding	
.	

Hence	
,	
the	
causality	
link	
between	
tooth	ORGAN
contact	
and	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
is	
not	
supported	
by	
the	
temporal	
sequence	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Sleep	
related	
bruxism	
tends	
to	
occur	
in	
families	
;	
approximately	
20	
%	
to	
50	
%	
of	
affected	
individuals	
have	
at	
least	
one	
direct	
family	
member	
with	
a	
history	
of	
tooth	ORGAN
grinding	
,	
and	
childhood	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
appears	
to	
persist	
into	
adulthood	
in	
two	
thirds	
of	
reported	
cases	
.	

However	
,	
no	
genetic	
variants	
or	
genetic	
inheritance	
patterns	
so	
far	
have	
been	
associated	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
onset	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
may	
occur	
during	
childhood	
,	
adolescence	
,	
or	
adulthood	
.	

It	
is	
difficult	
to	
establish	
the	
time	
of	
onset	
with	
precision	
because	
it	
is	
mainly	
based	
on	
the	
awareness	
of	
the	
individual	
or	

his	
/	
her	
family	
members	
who	
report	
the	
disorder	
.	

Sleep	
related	
bruxism	
in	
childhood	
has	
been	
reported	
by	
parents	
to	
begin	
as	
soon	
as	
both	
upper	
and	
lower	
teeth	ORGAN
have	
erupted	
.	

Secondary	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
may	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
,	
but	
is	
more	
common	
in	
younger	
and	
middle	
-	
aged	
adults	
.	

Even	
without	
a	
tooth	ORGAN
grinding	
history	
or	
complaints	
,	
RMMA	CANCER
may	
be	
observed	
in	
most	
normal	
sleepers	
(	
on	
average	
,	
one	
episode	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
)	
across	
the	
life	
span	
.	

However	
,	
in	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
,	
jaw	CANCER
-	CANCER
muscle	CANCER
contractions	CANCER
are	
more	
frequent	
and	
more	
intense	
.	

This	
may	
explain	
the	
secondary	
tooth	ORGAN
damage	
and	
the	
occurrence	
of	
pain	
and	
other	
symptoms	
.	

The	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
variability	
in	
episodes	
of	
audible	
tooth	ORGAN
grinding	
sounds	
is	
large	
(	
greater	
than	
50	
%	
coefficient	
of	
variation	
)	
.	

In	
-	
laboratory	
polysomnographic	
record-	
ings	
indicate	
that	
the	
corresponding	
variability	
in	
frequency	
of	
RMMA	
is	
smaller	
(	
approximately	
25	
%	
)	
,	
although	
ambulatory	
recording	
has	
suggested	
somewhat	
higher	
RMMA	CANCER
variability	
.	

First	
-	
night	
effect	
on	
RMMA	
index	
is	
minimal	
.	

Dental	
damage	
and	
abnormal	
tooth	ORGAN
wear	
are	
the	
most	
frequent	
signs	
of	
the	
disorder	
.	

However	
,	
they	
are	
not	
a	
direct	
proof	
of	
current	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
and	
many	
contrib-	
uting	
factors	
have	
to	
be	
ruled	
out	
(	
e.g.	
,	
type	
of	
diet	
in	
the	
occurrence	
of	
abnormal	
tooth	ORGAN
wear	
)	
.	

Diagnostic	
discriminative	
strength	
of	
these	
dental	
findings	
is	
weak	
;	
severity	
of	
wear	
can	
not	
account	
for	
the	
index	
(	
i.e.	
,	
frequency	
of	
RMMA	
)	
.	

Sleep	
related	
bruxism	
could	
lead	
to

or

movement	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
limitations	
)	
,	
although	
recent	
evidence	
does	
not	
support	
this	
association	
.	

Transient	
morning	
orofacial	
pain	
,	
including	
temporal	
headaches	
,	
is	
not	
uncommon	
,	
as	
described	
above	
.	

Hypertrophy	
of	
the	
masseter	TISSUE
and	
temporalis	TISSUE
muscles	TISSUE
can	
occur	
,	
but	
the	
diagnostic	
specificity	
of	
this	
finding	
for	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
is	
also	
weak	
.	

The	
natural	
course	
of	
this	
sleep	
disorder	
is	
usually	
benign	
.	

Many	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
remain	
asymptomatic	
for	
most	
of	
their	
lives	
.	

Others	
can	
experi-	
ence	
associated	
symptoms	
(	
i.e.	
,	
pain	
)	
that	
may	
interfere	
with	
their	
quality	
of	
life	
and/	
or	
sleep	
and	
may	
require	
treatments	
.	

Further	
diagnostic	
investigations	
and	
assessment	
are	
recommended	
if	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
is	
associated	
with	
other	
more	
severe	
sleep

medical	
disorders	
(

Developmental	
Issues	
Sleep

bruxism	
is	
frequently	
reported	
in

However

some

may	
experience	
it

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
majority	
of	
RMMA	
episodes	
during	
sleep	
(	
up	
to	
80	
%	
)	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
sleep	
arousals	
.	

Sleep	
related	
bruxism	
episodes	
typically	
follow	
a	
clear	
arousal	
sequence	
,	
starting	
with	
increased	
sympathetic	
-	
cardiac	ORGAN
activity	
and	
fast	
electroenceph-	
alographic	
(	
EEG	
)	
waves	
in	
the	
minutes	
to	
seconds	
preceding	
the	
onset	
of	
an	
RMMA	
episode	
.	

The	
jaw	CANCER

contractions	CANCER
are	
then	
followed	
by	
,	
or	
are	
concomitant	
with	
,	
an	
increase	
in

pressure	
and	
ventilation	
.	

RMMA	
episodes	
sometimes	
conclude	
with	
swallowing	
.	

Other	
causes	
of	
sleep	
bruxism	
onset	
are	
unknown	
,	
although	
potential	
candidates	
include	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
resistance	
and	
oropharyngeal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
dryness	
.	

In	
the	
majority	
of	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
,	
the	
frequency	
of	
sleep	
arous-	
als	
is	
within	
the	
normal	
range	
.	

However	
,	
they	
may	
have	
an	
exaggerated	
responsiveness	
to	
ongoing	
sleep	
arousals	
or	
an	
increased	
magnitude	
of	
arousal	
.	

Individuals	
with

bruxism	
show	
more

an	
expression	
of	
increased

and	
increased

This	
increased

seems	
to	
be	
the	
“

,	
whereas	
fewer

However	
,	
in	
some	
individuals	
,

occurs	
predominantly	
in

As

,	
the	
majority	
of	
sleep

are	
temporally

(

Three

An

begins	
after	
at

a

The

in

in	
severe	
cases	
is	
moderate

however	
,	
it	
may

,	
there

that	
normally	
occur	
during

be	
met	
A.	ORGANISM

The	
patient	ORGANISM
exhibits	
repetitive	
,	
stereotyped	
,	
and	
rhythmic	
motor	
behaviors	
involving	
large	
muscle	ORGAN
groups	
.	

B.	
The	
movements	
are	
predominantly	
sleep	
related	
,	
occurring	
near	
nap	
or	
bedtime	
,	
or	
when	
the	
individual	
appears	
drowsy	
or	
asleep	
.	

C.	ORGANISM

The	
behaviors	
result	
in	
a	
significant	
complaint	
as	
manifest	
by	
at	
least	
one	
of	
the	
following:1	
.	

Interference	
with	
normal	
sleep	
.	
.	

Significant	
impairment	
in	
daytime	
function	
.	
.	

Self	
-	
inflicted	
bodily	
injury	
or	
likelihood	
of	
injury	
if	
preventive	
measures	
are	
not	
used	
.	

D.	

The	
rhythmic	
movements	
are	
not	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
movement	
disorder	
or	
epilepsy	
.	

Notes	
.	

When	
there	
are	
no	
clinical	
consequences	
of	
the	
rhythmic	
movements	
,	
the	
rhythmic	
movements	
are	
simply	
noted	
but	
the	
term	
rhythmic	
movement	
disorder	
is	
not	
employed	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movement	
disorder	
(	
RMD	
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
repetitive	
,	
ste-	
reotyped	
,	
and	
rhythmic	
motor	
behaviors	
(	
not	
tremors	
)	
that	
occur	
predominantly	
during	
drowsiness	
or	
sleep	
and	
involve	
large	
muscle	ORGAN
groups	
.	

The	
occurrence	
of	
significant	
clinical	
consequences	
differentiates	
RMD	
from	
developmentally	
normal	
sleep	
related	
movements	
.	

Typically	
seen	
in	
infants	
and	
children	ORGANISM
,	
but	
also	
in	
adults	
,	
RMD	
comprises	
several	
sub-	
types	
.	

Body	
rocking	
may	
involve	
the	
entire	
body	
,	
with	
the	
individual	
on	
hands	
and	
knees	
,	
or	
it	
may	
be	
limited	
to	
the	
torso	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
with	
the	
individual	
sitting	
.	

Head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
banging	
often	
occurs	
with	
the	
person	
prone	
,	
repeatedly	
lifting	
the	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
or	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
entire	
upper	
torso	
,

back	CANCER
down	
into	
the

.	

Alternately	
,	
the	
individual	
may	
sit	
with	
the	
back	
of	
the	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
against	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
the	
headboard	
or	
wall	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
,	
repeatedly	
banging	
the	
occiput	ORGAN
.	

Combining	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
banging	
and	
body	
rocking	
,	
they	
may	
rock	
on	
hands	
and	
knees	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
,	
banging	
the	
vertex	
or	
frontal	TISSUE
region	
of	
the	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
into	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
the	
headboard	
or	
wall	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
.	

Head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
rolling	
consists	
of	
side	
-	
to	
-	
side	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
movements	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
usually	
with	
the	
child	
(	
or	
adult	
)	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
.	

Less	
common	
rhythmic	
movement	
forms	
include	
body	
rolling	
,	
leg	ORGAN
banging	
,	
or	
leg	ORGAN
rolling	
.	

Rhythmic	
humming	
or	
inarticulate	
sounds	
often	
accompany	
the	
body	
,	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
or	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movements	
and	
may	
be	
quite	
loud	
.	

Episodes	
often	
occur	
near	
sleep	
onset	
,	
although	
they	
also	
may	
occur	
at	
any	
time	
during	
the	
night	
and	
even	
during	
quiet	
wakeful	
activities	
,	
such	
as	
listening	
to	
music	
or	
trav-	
eling	
in	
vehicles	
.	

The	
movement	
frequency	
can	
vary	
,	
but	
the	
rate	
is	
usually	
between	
0.5	
per	
second	
and	
two	
per	
second	
.	

Duration	
of	
the	
individual	
movement	
clusters	
also	
varies	
but	
generally	
is	
less	
than	
15	
minutes	
.	

Cessation	
of	
movements	
may	
occur	
fol-	
lowing	
environmental	
disturbance	
or	
being	
spoken	
to	
.	

Children	ORGANISM
who	
have	
sufficient	
language	
development	
to	
be	
asked	
about	
event	
recall	
in	
the	
morning	
are	
typically	
amnestic	
for	
the	
episodes	
.	

Rarely	
,	
adults	
will	
report	
a	
volitional	
component	
.	

Sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
are	
common	
in	
normal	
infants	ORGANISM
and	
children	ORGANISM
.	

Without	
evidence	
for	
significant	
consequences	
,	
the	
movements	
alone	
should	
not	
be	
considered	
a	
disorder	
.	

Sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
should	
be	
considered	
a	
disorder	
only	
if	
the	
behaviors	
significantly	
interfere	
with	
normal	
sleep	
,	
cause	
significant	
impairment	
in	
daytime	
function	
,	
or	
result	
in	
self	
-	
inflicted	
bodily	
injury	
(	
or	
would	
result	
in	
injury	
if	
preventive	
measures	
are	
not	
used	
)	
.	

Associated	
Features	
The	
vast	
majority	
of	
infants	ORGANISM
and	
children	ORGANISM
with

Demographics	

At	
nine	
months	
of	
age	
,	
59	
%	
of	
all	
infants	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
exhibit	
one	
or	
more	
of	
the	
following	
sleep

rhythmic	
movements	
:	
body

)	
,	
or

(	
24	
%	
)	
.	

At	
18	
months	
,	
the	
overall	
prevalence	
has	
been	
reported	
to	
decline	
to	
33	
%	
,	
and	
by	
five	
years	
,	
to	
only	
5	
%	
.	

Most	
pediatric	
studies	
have	
found	
no	
sex	
difference	
.	

Over	
50	
cases	
of	
RMD	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
adolescents	
and	
adults	
,	
with	
a	
male	
pre-	
ponderance	
found	
in	
adults	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
soothing	
effect	
of	
vestibular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
stimulation	
has	
been	
proposed	
as	
the	
initiating	
factor	
in	
infants	
and	
toddlers	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
.	

Environmental	
stress	
and	
lack	
of	
environmental	
stimulation	
have	
also	
been	
proposed	
as	
factors	
.	

One	
study	
found	
higher	
anxiety	
scores	
in	
children	ORGANISM
with	
body	
rocking	
than	
in	
controls	
.	

Self	
-	
stimulation	
has	
been	
suggested	
as	
a	
factor	
,	
particularly	
in	
intellectually	
disabled	
,	
autistic	
,	
and	
emotionally	
disturbed	
children	ORGANISM
.	

Rhythmic	
movements	
have	
been	
postulated	
to	
be	
a	
calming	
technique	
employed	
by	
children	ORGANISM
to	
combat	
insomnia	
.	

Rhythmic	
movements	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
association	
with	
RLS	
,	
OSA	
,	
narcolepsy	
,	
RBD	
,	
and	
ADHD	CANCER
.	

Rhythmic	
movements	
may	
be	
used	
as	
a	
conscious	
strategy	
to	
relieve	
the	
urge	
to	
move	
or	
the	
uncomfortable	
sensations	
associated	
with	
RLS	
.	
OSA-	

associated	
RMD	
often	
improves	
with	
positive	
airway	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
pressure	
.	

Individuals	
with	
narco-	
lepsy	
may	
initiate	
rhythmic	
movements	
to	
terminate	
episodes	
of	
sleep	
paralysis	
.	

In	
older	
children	ORGANISM
or	
adults	
,	
stereotypic	
movements	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
intellectual	
disability	
or	
autism	
spectrum	
disorder	
.	

However	
,	
in	
most	
of	
these	
cases	
,	
the	
movements	
are	
not	
predominantly	
sleep	
related	
,	
and	
an	
additional	
diagnosis	
of	
RMD	
is	
not	
indicated	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

A	
familial	
pattern	
has	
been	
reported	
rarely	
,	
as	
has	
occurrence	
in	
identical	
twins	CANCER
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
onset	
of	
sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
is	
typically	
in	
early	
childhood	
.	

Body	
rocking	
has	
a	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
six	
months	
,	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
banging	
of	
nine	
months	
,	
and	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
rolling	
of	
ten	
months	
.	

The	
condition	
may	
rarely	
present	
at	
an	
older	
age	
following	
central	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
nervous	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
system	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM
trauma	
.	

Sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
commonly	
resolve	
in	
the	
second	
or	
third	
year	
of	
life	
.	

Persistence	
at	
five	
years	
of	
age	
occurs	
in	
about	
5	
%	
of	
children	ORGANISM
.	

Sleep	
related	
movements	
rarely	
continue	
into	
adolescence	
and	
adulthood	
.	

Worsening	
or	
spontaneous	
onset	
in	
adults	
is	
very	
rare	
.	

In	
some	
adult	
cases	
the	
chief	
concern	
is	
disturbance	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
.	

Most	
adolescents	
and	
adults	
have	
one	
form	
of	
RMD	
,	
although	
some	
have	
two	
or	
more	
.	

Head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
banging	
is	
the	
most	
disturbing	
form	
of	
the	
problem	
.	

Typical	
cases	
in	
infants	
and	
toddlers	
pose	
little	
risk	
of	
serious	
injury	
.	

Vigorous	
rhythmic	
movements	
can	
produce	
loud	
noises	
when	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
hits	
the	
bed	
frame	
or	
when	
the	
bed	
bangs	
against	
the	
wall	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
or	
floor	
.	

The	
noises	
can	
be	
very	
disturbing	
to	
other	
family	
members	
.	

Parental	
concern	
is	
common	
,	
and	
psychosocial	
consequences	
in	
the

In

rhythmic	
movements	
have	
been	
hypothesized	
to	
promote	
motor	
development

then	
a

Unresolved

Directions	

There	
is	
controversy	
about	
the	
classification	
of

foot	
tremor	
as	
a	
separate	
entity	
or	
as	
a	
subtype	
of

rhythmic	
movements

Many	
aspects	
of	
sleep

rhythmic	
movements	
deserve	
further	
study

including	
the	
relationship	
of	
the	
typical

to	
the

The	
pathophysiology

Essential	
Features	
Benign	
sleep	
myoclonus	
of	
infancy	
(	
BSMI	
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
repetitive	
myoclonic	
jerks	
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
in	
neonates	ORGANISM
and	
infants	
.	

Although	
BSMI	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
benign	CANCER
and	
relatively	
rare	
,	
it	
is	
included	
in	
the	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
section	
because	
it	
is	
commonly	
confused	
with	
epilepsy	
.	

However	
,	
unlike	
the	
jerks	
of	
myoclonic	
seizures	
and	
myoclonic	
encephalopathy	
,	
the	
jerks	
of	
BSMI	
occur	
exclusively	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
jerks	
are	
often	
bilateral	
and	
massive	
,	
typically	
involving	
large	
muscle	ORGAN
groups	
.	

The	
movements	
can	
occur	
in	
the	
whole	
body	
or	
exclusively	
in	
the	
limbs	ORGAN
,	
the	
trunk	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
or

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Most	
infants	
with	
BSMI	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
are	
neurologically	
normal	
,	
born	
to	
mothers	
with	
no	
history	
of	
illicit	
drug	
use	
.	

However	
,	
BSMI	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
has	
been	
described	
in	
more	
than	
half	
of	
infants	ORGANISM
with	
neonatal	
opioid	
withdrawal	
syndrome	
,	
suggesting	
a	
subtype	
with	
this	
specific	
etiology	
.	

It	
must	
be	
stressed	
,	
however	
,	
that	
some	
cases	
of	
neonatal	
abstinence	
syndrome	
do	
not	
follow	
a	
benign	
clinical	
course	
.	

Whether	
such	
cases	
should	
be	
included	
with	
those	
of	
BSMI	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
an	
unresolved	
matter

age	
in	
a	
neurologically	
normal	
infant	
.	

The	
course	
is

and	
benign	CANCER
.	

The	
disorder	
may	
be	
present	
for	
only	
a	
few	
days	
or	
may	
last	
for	
several	
months	
.	

Maximum	
expression	
is	
typically	
between	
15	
and

Developmental	
Issues	
Because	
age

related	
factors	
are	
a	
critical	
dimension	
for	
BSMI	
,	
developmental	
issues	
are	
discussed	
throughout	
this	
section	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
presence	
of	
a	
generator	
in	
the	
cervical	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
spinal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
cord	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
that	
is	
not	
adequately	
inhibited	
due	
to	
immature	
myelination	
of	
descending	
pathways	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Video	
-	
polysomnographic	
EEG	
and	
EMG	CANCER
monitoring	
has	
demonstrated	
paroxysmal	
muscle	ORGAN
activity	
,	
without	
ictal	
or	
interictal	
EEG	
abnormalities	
.	

BSMI	
occurs	
predom-	
inantly	
during	
quiet	
sleep	
but	
also	
may	
be	
present	
during	
active	
sleep	
.	

The	
muscle	ORGAN
jerks	
are	
usually	
seen	
in	
clusters	
of	
four	
or	
five	
jerks	
per	
second	
,	
each	
jerk	
lasting	
40	
to	
300	
milliseconds	
.	

BSMI	
clusters	
typically	
repeat	
in	
irregular	
series	
for	
one	
to	
15	
minutes	
,	
but	
,	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
the	
clusters	
may	
recur	
for	
up	
to	
60	
minutes	
or	
longer	
and	
be	
mistaken	
for	
status	
epilepticus	
.	

One	
study	
showed	
30	
%	
of	
the	
jerks	
to	
involve	
the	
whole	
body	
,	
20	
%	
to	
involve	
the	
abdominal	
or	
proximal	
muscles	ORGAN
,	
and	
50	
%	
to	
involve	
only	
the	
arms	
or	
the	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
.	

The	
arms	
are	
usually	
more	
involved	
than	
the	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
.	

Activity	
is	
symmetrical	
in	
over	
90	
%	
of	
cases	
but	
can	
be	
lateralized	
.	

The	
myoclonus	
is	
not	
associ-	
ated	
with	
arousals	
,	
awakenings	
,	
or	
sleep	
stage	
transitions	
.	

Spontaneous	
or	
provoked	
awakening	
of	
the	
infant	
leads	
to	
prompt	
,	
abrupt	
,	
and	
consis-	
tent	
cessation	
of	
the	
movements	
.	

Gentle	
rocking	
of	
the	
infant	
or	
the	
infant	
’s	
crib	
has	
been	
shown	
to	
provoke	
the	
myoclonus	
.	

This	
may	
be	
a	
useful	
maneuver	
during	
EEG	
monitoring	
when	
differentiation	
from	
seizures	
is	
of	
concern	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
jitteriness	
and	
other	
nonepileptic	
etiologies	
,	
BSMI	
will	
often	
increase	
rather	
than	
be	
suppressed	
by	
gentle	
restraint	
.	

Neuroimaging	
studies	
are	
normal	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
BSMI	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
myoclonic	
seizures	
;	
misdiagnosis	
may	
lead	
to	
unnecessary	
diagnostic	
testing	
or	
medication	
use	
.	

The	
absence	
of	
episodes	
while	
awake	
in	
infants	
with	
BSMI	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
the	
single	
most	
helpful	
clinical	
feature	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
BSMI	
will	
stop	
abruptly	
and	
consistently	
when	
the	
infant	
is	
aroused	
.	

Neonatal	
sei-	
zures	
are	
often	
seen	
in	
the	
context	
of	
perinatal	
disorders	
such	
as	
hypoxic	
-	
ischemic	
encephalopathy	
,	
infection	
,	
or	
metabolic	
abnormalities	
,	
whereas	
BSMI	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
typically	
present	
in	
neurologically	
normal	
infants	
.	

Infantile	
spasms	
(	
West	
syndrome	
)	
are	
most	
often	
seen	
after	
the	
first	
month	
of	
life	
but	
sometimes	
occur	
earlier	
.	

Infantile	
spasms	
are	
usually	
manifest	
by	
sudden	
head	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
flexion	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
with	
arm	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
extension	
and	
lower	
extremity	
flexion	
.	

They	
are	
usually	
associated	
with	
a	
hypsarrhythmic	
EEG	
pattern	
.	

Pyridoxine-	
dependency	
seizures	
are	
responsive	
to	
treatment	
with	
vitamin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
B6	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

In	
cases	
that	
are	
dif-	
ficult	
to	
differentiate	
,	
an	
EEG	
obtained	
during	
sleep	
will	
show	
normal	
patterns	
when	
BSMI	
is	
elicited	
by	
gentle	
rocking	
.	

Anticonvulsant	
medications	
are	
ineffective	
and	
unnecessary	
in	
BSMI	
.	

BSMI	
also	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
disorders	
that	
occur	
during	
wakeful-	
ness	
,	
including	
myoclonic	
encephalopathies	
,	
hyperekplexia	
(	
startle	
disease	
)	
,	
drug	
withdrawal	
,	
and	
jitteriness	
.	

Benign	
myoclonus	
of	
early	
infancy	
usually	
occurs	
after	
the	
third	
month	
of	
life	
and	
only	
occurs	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

PLMD	
can	
occur	
in	
infants	
but	
typically	
has	
a	
distinctly	
different	
duration	
and	
fre-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
quency	
.	

The	
muscle	ORGAN
activity	
is	
of	
longer	
duration	
(	
0.5	
to	
10	
seconds	
)	
and	
recurs	
at	
a	
more	
regular	
and

Notes

Although	
there	
is	
no	
current	
definitive	
evidence	
that	
propriospinal	
myoclonus	
confined	
to	
sleep	
onset	
is	
associated	
with	
significant	
structural	
lesions	
of	
the	
spinal	ORGAN
cord	ORGAN
,	
propriospinal	
myoclonus	
that	
is	
persistent	
during	
the	
day	
has	
been	
linked	
to	
structural	
spinal	ORGAN
cord	ORGAN
pathology	
in	
16	
%	
to	
20	
%	
of	
cases	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Propriospinal	
myoclonus	
at	
sleep	
onset	
(	
PSM	
)	
consists	
of	
sudden	
myoclonic	
jerks	
occurring	
in	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
and	
,	
rarely	
,	
during	
intrasleep	
wakefulness	
and	
upon	
awakening	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

The	
jerks	
arise	
mainly	
in	
the	
axial	
muscles	
and	
spread	
rostrally	
and	
caudally	
according	
to	
propriospinal	CELLULAR_COMPONENT
propagation	
.	

The	
jerks	
may	
be	
of	
variable	
intensity	
;	
they	
are	
isolated	
,	
recurring	
in	
quasi	
-	
periodic	
fashion	
for	
variable	
durations	
,	
or	
may	
be	
repeated	
in	
brief	
clusters	
of	
a	
few	
movements	
,	
sepa-	
rated	
by	
longer	
intervals	
.	

Jerks	
involve	
the	
abdominal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
and	
truncal	TISSUE
muscles	TISSUE
first	
and	
are	
then	
propagated	
to	
proximal	
muscles	ORGAN
of	
the	
limbs	ORGAN
and	
the	
neck	
.	

The	
pattern	
of	
move-	
ment	
is	
usually	
flexor	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
but	
may	
be	
an	
extension	
of	
the	
trunk	TISSUE
.	

Vocalization	
rarely	
occurs	
.	

The	
jerks	
are	
most	
often	
spontaneous	
but	
,	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
can	
be	
evoked	
by	
external	
stimulations	
.	

The	
jerks	
appear	
to	
be	
related	
to	
the	
recumbent	
position	
and	
a	
state	
of	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
,	
particularly	
when	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
tries	
to	
fall	
asleep	
.	

Any	
mental	
acti-	
vation	
makes	
the	
jerks	
disappear	
.	

The	
jerks	
eventually	
disappear	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
remain	
absent	
throughout	
all	
stages	
of	
sleep	
,	
even	
though	
they	
sometimes	
reappear	
during	
intrasleep	
wakefulness	
.	

Associated	
Features	
PSM	
often	
is	
associated	
with	
severe	
sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	
due	
to	
the	
inability	
of	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
to	
fall	
asleep	
because	
of	
the	
recurrent	
disturbing	
muscular	TISSUE
activity	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
PSM	
may	
be	
considered	
a	
variant	
of	
the	
more	
generally	
described	
propriospinal	
myoc-	
lonus	
seen	
during	
the	
daytime	
.	

In	
daytime	
PSM	
,	
myoclonic	
jerks	
involve	
the	
thoracoab-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
dominal	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
/	
paraspinal	ORGAN
or	
cervical	TISSUE
muscles	TISSUE
and	
spread	
caudally	
or	
rostrally	
to	
the	
other	
myotomes	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
.	

The	
jerks	
are	
provoked	
or	
worsened	
by	
the	
recumbent	
position	
and	
can	
not	
be	
voluntarily	
suppressed	
.	

They	
are	
often	
preceded	
by	
premonitory	
sensations	
,	
are	
stable	
over	
time	
,	
and	
respond	
unpredictably	
to	
drug	
treatment	
.	

The	
frequent	
presleep	
worsening	
of	
daytime	
PSM	
(	
around	
50	
%	
of	
the	
cases	
)	
suggests	
that	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
PSM	
may	
have	
a	
milder	
or	
variant	
form	
of	
a	
single	
clinical	
and	
neurophysiologic	
entity

Complications	
PSM

and	
is	
usually	
a	
chronic	
,	
unremitting	
condition	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
may	
develop	
a	
fear	
of	
falling	
asleep	
,	
anxiety	
,	
and	
depression

Intense

.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
of	
PSM	
is	
unknown	
.	

PSM	
is	
thought	
to	
originate	
from	
a	
focal	
spinal	
pattern	
generator	
,	
set	
into	
motion	
by	
supraspinal	
dysfacilitatory	
influences	
typical	
of	
the	
state	
of	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
and	
drowsiness	
.	

PSM	
is	
presumed	
to	
propagate	
up	
and	
down	
the	
spinal	ORGAN
cord	ORGAN
via	
slowly	
conducting	
,	
long	
propriospinal	
(	
intersegmental	
)	
pathways	
.	

A	
focal	
spinal	
generator	
thus	
is	
able	
to	
recruit	
muscles	TISSUE
from	
multiple	
segments	
.

Jerks	
disappear	
either	
with

to

or	
with	
appearance	
of

and

Jerks	
remain	
absent	
throughout	
sleep	
but	
may	
occasionally	
reappear	
upon	
awakening	
and	
during	
intrasleep	
wakefulness	
.	

Polysomnography	
with	
extended	
EMG	CANCER
recording	
demonstrates	
that	
the	
jerks	
arise	
first	
in	
spinal	ORGAN
innervated	ORGAN
muscles	TISSUE
and	
then	
propagate	
to	
more	
caudal	TISSUE
and	
rostral	TISSUE
muscles	TISSUE
according	
to	
a	
propriospinal	
pattern	
of	
propagation	
.	

Detailed	
analysis	
of	
the	
jerks	
shows	
that	
the	
EMG	CANCER
activity	
originates	
in	
muscles	ORGAN
innervated	
by

and	
then

at	
a

MRI	
of	
the

In	
a	
recent	
review	
of	
PSM	
,	
only	
one	
patient	ORGANISM
with	
exacerbation	
at	
sleep	
onset	
had	
a	
hypersignal	
at	
T10	
-	
T11	
and	
a	
nonspecific	
medullary	CANCER

lesion	
.	

The	
remaining	
patients	ORGANISM
had	
no	
signs	
on	
spinal	ORGAN
cord	ORGAN
MRI	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

MRI	
of	
the	
spine	
is	
usually	
normal	
but	
demonstrates	
a	
focal	CELLULAR_COMPONENT
lesion	
in	
around	
20	
%	
of	
the	
cases	
.	

The	
causal	
relationship	
of	
PSM	
with	
these	
spinal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
lesions	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
is	
unclear	
,	
although	
magnetic	
resonance	
diffusion	
tensor

with

may	
demonstrate	
spinal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
tract	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
disorganization	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
PSM	
shows	
features	
similar	
to	
those	
of	
the	
syndrome	
of	
intensified	
sleep	
starts	
.	

However	
,	
sleep	
starts	
(	
hypnic	
jerks	
)	
usually	
appear	
during	
the	
transition	
between	
wakefulness	
and	
sleep	
and	
during	
light	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
whereas	
PSM	
may	
sometimes	
be	
present	
during	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
.	

Unlike	
PSM	
,	
sleep	
starts	
(	
hypnic	
jerks	
)	
some-	
times	
affect	
only	
one	
or	
a	
few	
body	
segments	
;	
propriospinal	CELLULAR_COMPONENT
propagation	
is	
not	
present	
in	
neurophysiological	
studies	
of	
sleep	
starts	
.	

Phasic	
REM	
twitches	
,	
which	
are	
a	
normal	
phenomenon	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
involve	
the	
distal	
muscles	ORGAN
of	
the	
hands	
and	
face	
,	
often	
without	
displacement	
of	
the	
body	
segment	
.	

Fragmentary	
myoclonus	
resembles	
physiological	
hypnic	
myoclonus	
,	
but	
in	
an	
enhanced	
form	
,	
and	
persists	
throughout	
all	
stages	
of	
NREM	
and	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Both	
physiological	
hypnic	
myoclonus	
and	
frag-	
mentary	
myoclonus	
are	
EMG	CANCER
findings	
not	
associated	
with	
overt	CANCER
muscular	CANCER
activity	
and	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
do	
not	
involve	
muscles	TISSUE
acting	
across	
large

.	

Epileptic	
myoclonus	
is	
not	
confined	
to	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
and	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
epileptic	
discharges	
on	
the	
EEG	CANCER
.	

PLMS	
are	
longer	
in	
duration	
,	
involve	
mainly	
the	
lower	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
limbs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
,	
and	
usually	
spare	
truncal	
and	
abdominal	TISSUE
muscles	TISSUE
.	

PLMs	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
may	
begin	
during	
presleep	
wakefulness	
but	
generally	
occur	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
RLS	
may	
have	
prominent	
PLMs	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
in	
wakefulness	
while	
sitting	
or	
lying	
down	
.	

However	
,	
prominent	
leg	ORGAN
discomfort	
is	
usually	
present	
in	
these	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

Occasionally	
PSM	
may	
be	
present	
in	
RLS	
/	
PLMS	
patients	ORGANISM
in	
wake	
before	
sleep	
,	
but	
the	
EMG	CANCER
morphology	
is	
different	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
when	
myoclonic	
jerks	
involving	
leg	TISSUE
muscles	TISSUE
appear	
,	
the	
PSM	
disappears	
.	

Psychogenic	
myoclonus	
may	
simulate	
PSM	
but	
the	
muscle	ORGAN
recruitment	
pattern	
,	
the	
spread	
velocity	
,	
and	
the	
record-	
ing	
of	
cortical	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
premovement	
activity	
observed	
before	
voluntary	
movements	
may	
be	
useful	
to	
differentiate	
the	
two	
types	
of	
jerks	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
Future	
studies	
are	
needed	
to	
better	
define	
the	
distinctions	
between	
PSM	
and	
related	
conditions	
such	
as	
sleep	
starts	
(	
hypnic	
jerks	
)	
and	
,	
in	
particular	
,	
the	
syndrome	
of	
inten-	
sified	
sleep	
starts	
.	

Also	
,	
neuroimaging	
and	
possibly	
postmortem	
studies	
may	
detect	
the	
neural	TISSUE
structures	
responsible	
for	
the	
initiation	
of	
the	
myoclonic

Large

The

a

the

resemble	
the

that

which	
are	
generally	
clustered	
within	
small	
groups	
in	
a	
sleep

Its	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
importance	
lies	
in	
that	
it	
is	
within	
the	
differential	
diagnosis	
of	
other	
sleep

disorders	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
usually	
are	
not	
aware	
of	
the

.	

Patients	ORGANISM
may	
have	
other	
coexistent

but	
EFM	
does	
not	
appear	
to	
contribute	
to	
the	
symptoms	
of	
these	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

EFM	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
a	
NREM	CANCER
phenomenon

is	
less	
common	
than	
phasic	
REM	
twitches	
,	
which	
occur	
in

sleep	
in	
normal	
individuals	
without

complaints

Most	
cases	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
adults	
.	

EFM	
is	
predominantly	
found	
in	
males	
.	

A	
recent	
study	
found	
EFM	
in	
100	
%	
of	
62	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
a	
variety	
of	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
bringing	
into	
question	
the	
specificity	
of	
EFM	
.	

Numerous	
causes	
of	
chronic	
sleep	
fragmentation	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
EFM	CELL

The

has	
been

In

the

intensifies	
during

One

No

The	
contribution	
of	
EFM	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
to	
the	
symptomatology	
of	
any	
of	
these	
disorders	
is	
unknown	
.	

The	
course	
is	
not	
well	
studied	
but	
appears	
to	
be	
benign	CANCER
and	
non	
-	
progressive	
.	

The	
dis-	
order	
may	
be	
the	
sole	
abnormality	
in	
some	
cases	
of	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
,	
but	
causality	
is	
questionable	
.	

No	
other	
serious	
consequences	
of	
the	
disorder	
have	
been	
described	
when	
it	
occurs	
in	
isolation	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
EFM	CELL
is	
present	
in	
normal	
individuals	
.	

Its	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
relatively	
benign	
course	
sug-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
gests	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
that	
it	
is	
not	
associated	
with	
a	
neurodegenerative	
process	
.	

In	
most	
reported	
cases	
,	
there	
have	
been	
associated	
sleep	
abnormalities	
and	
sleep	
disruption	
,	
suggesting	
that	
EFM	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
may	
be	
due	
to	
disruptions	
of	
normal	
motor	
-	
control	
mechanisms	
during	
sleep	
.	

Whether	
there	
is	
a	
genetic	
or	
other	
basis	
predisposing	
individuals	
to	
develop	
the	
condi-	
tion	
is	
unknown	
.	

In	
any	
case	
,	
it	
would	
appear	
to	
result	
from	
intensification	
of	
an	
other-	
wise	
normal	
motor	
phenomenon	
.	

The	
predominant	
topographic	
distribution	
of	
EFM	CELL
in	
distal	
and	
facial	
muscles	
suggests	
that	
cortical	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
motor	
centers	
participate	
in	
its	
generation	
.	

EFM	
is	
detected	
as	
isolated	
,	
very	
brief	
(	
usually	
75	
to	
150	
milliseconds	
)

asymmetrical

.	

The	
amplitude	
varies	
from	
approximately	
50	
to	
several	
hundred	
microvolts	
;	
the	
taller	
amplitudes	
are	
often	
associated	
with	
visible	
movement	
of	
the	
fingers	
,	
toes	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
or	
corners	
of	
the	
mouth	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
whereas	
the	
smaller	
ones	
may	
resemble	
fasciculation	
potentials	
and	
be	
without	
overt	
movement	
.	

Large	
movements	
across	
large	
joint	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
spaces	
preclude	
a	
diag-	
nosis	
of	
EFM	
.	

Small	
twitch	
-	
like	
movements	
may	
be	
observed	
on	
video	
recording	
.	

Episodes	
of	
these	
myoclonic	
potentials	
typically	
last	
from	
10	
minutes	
to	
several	
hours	
.	

They	
often	
appear	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
continue	
through	
the	
NREM	
sleep	
stages	
,	
includ-	
ing	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
EFM	
in	
REM	
is	
difficult	
to	
determine	
because	
it	
is	
superimposed	
on	
the	
normal	
phasic	
clusters	
of	
physiological	
phasic	
REM	
twitches	
.	

EFM	
is	
electromyographically	
similar	
to	
the	
latter	
.	

Occasionally	
,	
the	
EMG	CANCER
activity	
also	
persists	
during	
EEG	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
within	
the	
sleep	
period	
or	
is	
present	
in	
drowsiness	
prior	
to	
sleep	
onset	
.	

The	
EEG	
usually	
shows	
no	
changes	
at	
the	
time	
of	
the	
movements	
,	
although	
high	
-	
amplitude	
EMG	CANCER
potentials	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
a	
K	
complex	
or	
even	
with	
transient	
EEG	
arousal	
.	

There	
are	
no	
ocular	
or	
autonomic	
accom-	
paniments	
.	

It	
seems	
possible	
that	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
digitalization	
rates	
,	
digital	
systems	
may	
record	
less	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	
than	
earlier	
paper	
records	
.	

No	
laboratory	
tests	
other	
than	
polysomnography	
(	
optimally	
with	
multiple	
EMG	CANCER
leads	
)	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
helpful	
in	
assessing	
EFM	CANCER
.	

EFM	
generally	
has	
a	
maximum	
burst	
duration	
of	
only	
150	
milliseconds	
and	
does	
not	
recur	
periodically	
.	

It	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
PLMS	
because	
PLMS	
are	
character-	
ized	
by	
a	
longer	
burst	
duration	
(	
typically	
0.5	
to	
10	
seconds	
)	
and	
a	
long	
period	
between	
bursts	
(	
5	
-	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

EFM	
,	
which	
occurs	
in	
NREM	CANCER
,	
must	
also	
be	
differentiated	
from	
normal	
physiological	
phasic	
REM	
twitches	
,	
which	
have	
a	
similar	
burst	
duration	
but	
are	
limited	
to	
the	
REM	
state	
and	
tend	
to	
occur	
in	
clusters	
within	
an	
epoch	
,	
as	
opposed	
to	
EFM	CELL
in	
which	
bursts	
tend	
not	
to	
cluster	
within	
a	
particular	
epoch	
.	

Larger	
body	
move-	

ments	
across	
the	
large	
joints	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
are	
not	
a	
feature	
of	
excessive	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
such	
movements	
suggests	
other	
disorders

Further	
investigation	
is	
necessary	
to	
determine	
whether	
EFM	CELL
occurs	
as	
a	
consequence	
of	
sleep	
disruption	
or	
whether	
it	
is	
an	
independent	
cause	
of	
sleep	
disruption	
and	
daytime	
symptoms	
in	
its	
own	
right	
.	

It	
must	
also	
be	
determined	
whether	
there	
are	
any	
physiolog-	
ical	
differences	
that	
distinguish	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	
seen	
in	
many	
normal	
individu-	
als	
from	
EFM	
.	

It	
is	
not	
known	
whether	
some	
additional	
pathophysiological	
element	
is	
required	
to	
increase	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	
into	
an	
abnormal	
range	
.	

The	
current	
thresh-	
old	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
EFM	CELL
should	
be	
further	
investigated	
because	
the	
scoring	
criteria	
lack	
specificity	
.	

The	
apparent	
strong	
predominance	
in	
males	
also	
remains	
unexplained

Hypnagogic	
Foot	
Tremor	
and	
Alternating	
Leg	CANCER
Muscle	CANCER
Activation	
Hypnagogic	
foot	
tremor	
(	
HFT	
)	
is	
rhythmic	
movement	
of	
the	
feet	
or	
toes	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
that	
occurs	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
wake	
and	
sleep	
or	
during	
light	
NREM	
sleep	
(	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
)	
.	

Alternating	
leg	TISSUE
muscle	TISSUE
activation	
(	
ALMA	
)	
consists	
of	
brief	
activation	
of	
the	
ante-	
rior	
tibialis	ORGAN
in	
one	
leg	ORGAN
in	
alternation	
with	
similar	
activation	
in	
the	
other	
leg	ORGAN
during	
sleep	
or	
arousals	
from	
sleep	
.	

HFT	
may	
be	
a	
relatively	
common	
and	
normal	
finding	
.	

Affected	
individuals	
move	
the	
feet	
or	
the	
toes	
rhythmically	
for	
seconds	
to	
minutes	
during	
drowsy	
wakefulness	
or	
lighter	
stages	
of	
sleep	
.	

It	
can	
be	
pathologically	
exagger-	
ated	
in	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

ALMA	
is	
defined	
by	
a	
polysomnographic	
pattern	
with	
unknown	
clinical	
manifestations	
,	
but	
frequency	
of	
muscle	ORGAN
activations	
,	
length	
of	
activations	
,	
and	
occurrence	
primarily	
with	
arousals	
suggest	
that	
ALMA	
may	
be	
similar	
to	
HFT	
or	
rep-	
resent	
an	
EMG	CANCER
manifestation	
of	
some	
episodes	
of	
HFT	
.	

The	
original	
case	
series	
that	
described	
ALMA	
did	
not	
link	
it	
with	
movement	
of	
the	
lower	
extremity	
,	
but	
a	
subse-	
quent	
report	
did	
.	

HFT	
and	
ALMA	
are	
considered	
together	
because	
the	
relationship	
between	
them	
remains	
to	
be	
clarified	
,	
and	
the	
similarity	
in	
a	
number	
of	
their	
features	
suggests	
they	
may	
not	
be	
fully	
independent	
entities	
.	

Associated	
features	
of	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
are	
similar	
.	

Most	
cases	
of	
HFT	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
persons	ORGANISM
with	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
such	
as	
RLS	
or	
SRBDs	
.	

ALMA	
has	
been	
identified	
mainly	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
SRBD	
or	
PLMs	CANCER
.	

Seventy	
-	
five	
percent	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
ALMA	
in	
the	
original	
series	
used	
antidepressant	
medication	
.	

In	
that	
study	
,	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
ALMA	
complained	
of	
sleepiness	
,	
insomnia	
,	
or	
restless	
of	
the	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
,	
but	
only	
one	
reported	
patient	ORGANISM
had	
more	
specific	
complaints	
of	
sudden	
nocturnal	
muscle	ORGAN
contractions	
in	
his	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
and	
a	
sensation	
that	
his	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
were	
vibrating	
.	

A	
separately	
reported	
case	
of	
a	
patient	ORGANISM
with	
ALMA	
documented	
absence	
of	
any	
SRBD	
,	
PLMs	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
,	
or	
use	
of	
antidepressant	
medication	
.	

This	
patient	ORGANISM
complained	
of	
frequent	
and	
easily	
provoked	
awakenings	
,	
as	
well	
as	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

The	
ALMA	
and	
symptoms	
responded	
to	
treat-	
ment	
with	
pramipexole	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

The	
single	
series	
in	
which	
HFT	
was	
studied	
found	
that	
it	
occurs	
in	
7.5	
%	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
in	
whom	
a	
polysomnogram	
was	
performed	
for	
other	
reasons	
.	

Affected	
individuals	
range	
in	
age	
from	
14	
to	
72	
years	
,	
with	
a	
majority	
in	
the	
middle	
-	
age	
range	
(	
40	
to	
65	
years	
)	
.	

Men	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
and	
women	ORGANISM
are	
equally	
affected	
.	

It	
is	
possible	
that	
the	
frequency	
of	
these	
move-	
ments	
may	
be	
increased	
in	
individuals	
with	
disorders	
such	
as	
RLS	
or	
SRBD	
,	
but	
it	
can	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
otherwise	
normal	
sleep	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
the	
condition	
in	
the	
general	
population	
and	
its	
frequency	
in	
affected	
individuals	
remains	
uncertain	
.	

The	
initial	
series	
reporting	
ALMA	
found	
that	
it	
occurs	
in	
1.1	
%	
of	
unselected	
studies	
from	
a	
sleep	
disorder	
center	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
with	
ALMA	
were	
mostly	
male	
(	
11:5	
)	
and	
ranged	
in	
age	
from	
12	
to	
70	
years	
,	
with	
most	
aged	
35	
to	
55	
years	
(	
mean	
age	
41	
years	
)	
.	

Therefore	
,	
the	
age	
ranges	
of	
both	
conditions	
are	
similar	
,	
with	
both	
males	
and	
females	
affected	
.	

These	
distributions	
may	
be	
due	
to	
the	
incidental	
discovery	
of	
both	
entities	
during	
routine	
sleep	
studies	
for	
other	
sleep	
complaints	
.	

No	
predisposing	
factors	
are	
known	
for	
HFT	
.	

The	
use	
of	
antidepressant	
medication	
may	
increase	
risk	
for	
ALMA	
.	

No	
longitudinal	
studies	
have	
been	
performed	
for	
either	
entity	
.	

In	
some	
individuals	
,	
HFT	
is	
an	
occasional	
finding	
,	
but	
others	
appear	
to	
manifest	
the	
rhythmic	
movements	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
on	
many	
nights	
and	
over	
a	
span	
of	
at	
least	
months	
.	

ALMA	
showed	
some	
tendency	
to	
persist	
between	
two	
different	
recordings	
in	
the	
originally	
reported	
series	
.	

Because	
most	
individuals	
are	
unaware	
of	
the	
presence	
of	
the	
HFT	
movements	
,	
and	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
ALMA	
may	
have	
no	
associated	
complaint	
or	
awareness	
of	
the	
phenomenon	
,	
the	
evo-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
lution	
of	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
follow	
except	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
or	
with	
home	
monitoring	
.	

Although	
usually	
an	
incidental	
and	
benign	CANCER
finding	
,	
HFT	
may	
cause	
sleep	
disruption	
and	
sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	
if	
sufficiently	
prolonged	
or	
severe	
.	

In	
HFT	
,	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
typically	
reports	
foot	
movements	
(	
directly	
experienced	
or	
observed	
by	
others	
)	
that	
occur	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
wake	
and	
sleep	
or	
during	
light	
sleep	
.	

On	
occasion	
,	
movement	
has	
not	
been	
observed	
but	
HFT	
is	
seen	
as	
an	
incidental	
finding	
on	
sleep	
study	
conducted	
for	
other	
indications	
.	

Polysomnography	
demonstrates	
a	
pattern	
of	
brief	
,	
repeated	
activation	
of	
the	
anterior	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
tibialis	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
in	
one	
leg	ORGAN
.	

The	
minimum	
frequency	
is	
0.3	
Hz	
;	
the	
maximum	
4.0	
Hz	
.	

Multiple	
leg	ORGAN
activations	
in	
a	
single	
leg	ORGAN
occur	
in	
a	
train	
of	
at	
least	
four	
movements	
.

EMG	CANCER
potentials	
or

.	

Typical	
associated	
EMG	CANCER
bursts	
are	
300	
to	
700	
milliseconds	
in	
duration	
,	
and	
the	
typical	
duration	
of	
trains	
is	
10	
to	
15	
seconds	
,	
although	
longer	
bursts	
and	
trains	
have	
been	
reported	
.	

In	
morbid	
conditions	
,	
trains	
may	
persist	
much	
longer	
.	

Events	
are	
recorded	
at	
the	
transition	
into	
sleep	
and	
during	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
.	

Distribution	
over	
the	
night	
has	
not	
been	
fully	
investigated	
.	

Persistent	
HFT	
has	
been	
found	
in	
about	
half	
of	
the	
indi-	
viduals	
who	
have	
had	
multiple	
studies	
.	

Alternation	
between	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
has	
not	
been	
described	
,	
but	
its	
potential	
occurrence	
is	
suggested	
in	
two	
published	
studies	
of	
HFT	
.	

In	
ALMA	
,	
polysomnography	
demonstrates	
a	
pattern	
of	
brief	
,	
repeated	
activation	
of	
the	
anterior	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
tibialis	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
in	
one	
leg	ORGAN
alternating	
with	
similar	
activation	
in	
the	
other	
leg	ORGAN
.	

At	
a	
minimum	
,	
a	
single	
leg	TISSUE
muscle	TISSUE
activation	
in	
one	
leg	ORGAN
is	
followed	
sequentially	
by	
a	
similar	
single	
activation	
in	
the	
other	
leg	ORGAN
,	
reactivation	
in	
the	
original	
leg	ORGAN
,	
and	
then	
reactivation	
in	
the	
alternate	
leg	ORGAN
,	
with	
some	
continued	
alternation	
beyond	
this	
minimal	
sequence	
in	
most	
instances	
.	

The	
minimum	
frequency	
of	
alternating	
EMG	CANCER
bursts	
is	
0.5	
Hz	
,	
and	
the	
maximum	
frequency	
is	
3.0	
Hz	
.	

The	
patient	ORGANISM
may	
report	
foot	
movements	
(	
directly	
experi-	
enced	
or	
observed	
by	
others	
)	
that	
occur	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
wake	
and	
sleep	
or	
during	
light	
sleep	
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
there	
is	
frequently	
no	
observation	
of	
movement	
reported	
but	
alternating	
leg	TISSUE
muscle	TISSUE
activation	
is	
recorded	
as	
an	
incidental	
finding	
on	
polysomnography	
.	

ALMA	
can	
be	
demonstrated	
by	
polysomnography	
if	
the	
surface	
EMG	
is	
recorded	
inde-	
pendently	
from	
both	
right	
and	
left	
anterior	
tibialis	
muscles	
.	

A	
sequence	
of	
ALMA	
may	
begin	
with	
one	
to	
several	
lengthy	
activations	
(	
one	
to	
two	
seconds	
)	
in	
one	
or	
both	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
show	
unilateral	
activity	
at	
times	
.	

ALMA	
usually	
closely	
precedes	
or	
follows	
an	
arousal	
or	
awakening	
and	
gradually	
diminishes	
as	
sleep	
returns	
.	

However	
,	
ALMA	
can	
also	
emerge	
without	
arousals	
from	
any	
sleep	
stage	
.	

Proclivity	
for	
any	
spe-	
cific	
portion	
of	
the	
nocturnal	
sleep	
cycle	
has	
not	
been	
identified	
.	

Leg	CELL
muscle	CELL
activa-	
tions	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
in	
comparison	
to	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
,	
are	
often	
briefer	
and	
some-	

what	
less	
regular	
.	

Sequences	
of	
ALMA	
sometimes	
recur	
at	
intervals	
similar	
to	
those	
of	
PLMs	CANCER
.	

Extensor	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE

study	
may	
suggest	
alternating	
muscle	ORGAN
activity	
in	
the	
upper	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
extremities	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
,	
though	
it	
is	
less	
prominent	
than	
activation	
in	
the	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
.	

ALMA	
shows	
some	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
consistency	
.	

Repeat	
studies	
are	
likely	
to	
show	
persistent	
ALMA	
.	

The	
number	
of	
sequences	
recorded	
,	
on	
average	
,	
and	
the	
timing	
of	
ALMA	
with	
respect	
to	
arousals	
tends	
to	
remain	
constant	
.	

The	
specific	
polysomnographic	
criteria	
for	
HFT	
during	
sleep	
and	
ALMA	
are	
defined	
in	
the	
most	
recent	
version	
of	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated	
Events	
.	

Presentation	
of	
HFT	
or	
ALMA	
with	
other	
concurrent	
sleep	
disorders	
is	
common	
.	

Because	
of	
the	
similar	
frequency	
,	
duration	
,	
and	
body	
part	
involvement	
of	
the	
move-	
ments	
,	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
may	
represent	
variants	
of	
the	
same	
disorder	
.	

Insufficient	
sci-	

entific	
evidence	
has	
accumulated	
to	
make	
this	
a	
certainty	
.	

Thus	
,	
these	
entities	
are	
listed	
sequentially	
but	
separately	
.	

Of	
note	
,	
some	
have	
questioned	
whether	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
might	
represent	
a	
variant	
of	
rhythmic	
movement	
disorder	
in	
which	
movements	
are	
confined	
to	
the	
legs	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
and	
an	
older	
population	
is	
affected	
.	

HFT	
and	
ALMA	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
sleep	
-	
onset	
movements	
:	
PLMD	
(	
especially	
the	
polyclonic	
form	
)	
,	
PSM	
,	
and	
sleep	
related	
RMD	
.	

Movement	
disorders	
that	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
include	
dyskinetic	
movements	
of	
the	
foot	
,	
such	
as	
painful	
legs	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
and	
moving	
toes	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
;	
tremors	
or	
rhythmic	
movements	
of	
other	
cause	
(	
Parkinson	CANCER
disease	CANCER
,	
clonus	
)	
;	
and	
neuroleptic	
-	
induced	
akathisia	
.	

None	
of	
these	
conditions	
involves	
regular	
alternation	
between	
sides	
,	
as	
seen	
in	
ALMA	
,	
or	
an	
associ-	
ation	
with	
the	
use	
of	
antidepressant	
medication	
.	

Whether	
HFT	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
ALMA	
is	
not	
known	
.	

Potential	
differences	
based	
on	
existing	
reports	
include	
the	
presence	
of	
clear	
movement	
in	
HFT	
as	
opposed	
to	
some	
uncertainty	
whether	
ALMA	
must	
involve	
movement	
.	

ALMA	
,	
in	
contrast	
to	
HFT	
,	
alternates	
between	
sides	
,	
occurs	
in	
any	
sleep	
stage	
,	
can	
occur	
without	
arousal	
,	
and	
is	
associated	
with	
the	
use	
of	
antidepressants	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL

some	
asso-	
ciation	
with

,	
and	
with	
potential	
overlap	
with	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
HFT	
,	
however	
,	
HFLM	
occur	
in	
all	
sleep	
stages	
,

are

In	
contrast	
to	
ALMA	
,	
HFLM	
are	
mostly	
unilateral	
rather	
than	
alternating	
,	
and	
often	
show	
sequences	
that	
last	
longer	
than	
those	
reported	
for	
ALMA	
.	

The	
reported	
HFLM	
may	
be	
more	
common	
than	
ALMA	
,	
and	
the	
possibility	
exists	
that	
ALMA	
rep-	
resents	
a	
subtype	
of	
HFLM	
in	
which	
leg	ORGAN
alternation	
occurs	
.	

The	
degree	
to	
which	
these	
movements	
are	
quasi	
-	
voluntary	
remains	
to	
be	
determined	
because	
some	
are	
suppressible	
.	

Whether	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
are	
merely	
alternate	
forms	
of	
the	
same	
underlying	
motor	
mechanism	
is	
also	
unclear	
.	

As	
reports	
of	
these	
move-	
ments	
have	
arisen	
from	
reviews	
of	
sleep	
center	
records	
,	
nothing	
is	
known	
about	
their	
manifestation	
in	
the	
general	
population	
.	

The	
associations	
noted	
may	
be	
due	
to	
biased	
sampling	
caused	
by	
a	
skewing	
of	
the	
population	
toward	
those	
with	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
especially	
respiratory	
disorders	
.	

The	
degree	
to	
which	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
have	
clinical	
significance	
remains	
uncertain

Sleep	
Starts	
(	
Hypnic	
Jerks	
)	

Sleep	
starts	
,	
also	
known	
as	
hypnic	
jerks	
,	
are	
sudden	
,	
brief	
,	
simultaneous	
contractions	
of	
the	
body	
or	
one	
or	
more	
body	
segments	
occurring	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
(	
or	
hypnic	
jerks	
)	
usually	
consist	
of	
a	
single	
contraction	
that	
often	
affects	
the	
body	
asymmetrically	
.	

The	
jerks	
may	
be	
either	
spontaneous	
or	
induced	
by	
stimuli	
.	

The	
motor	
activity	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
a	
sensory	
component	
,	
which	
may	
be	
somesthetic	
,	
often	
an	
impression	
of	
falling	
or	
less	
commonly	
pain	
or	
tingling	
;	
auditory	
,	
such	
as	
banging	
,	
snapping	
or	
crackling	
noises	
;	
or	
visual	
,	
including	
flashing	
lights	
,	
hypnagogic	
dreams	
,	
or	
hallucina-	
tions	
.	

A	
sharp	
cry	
may	
occur	
.	

The	
patient	ORGANISM
may	
not	
recall	
a	
jerk	
that	
was	
noted	
by	
a	
bed	
partner	
if	
the	
sleep	
start	
does	
not	
cause	
awakening	
.	

Multiple	
jerks	
occasionally	
occur	
in	
succession	
,	
usually	
early	
in	
the	
sleep	
period	
.	

When	
sleep	
starts	
or	
hypnic	
jerks	
are	
frequent	
,	
intense	
,	
or	
repetitive	
,	
they	
may	
lead	
to	
sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	
.	

Purely	
sensory	
sleep	
starts	
are	
subjective	
,	
localized	
,	
sensory	
impressions	
that	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
are	
not	
associated	
with	
motor	
activity	
.	

The	
term	
“	
Intensified	
sleep	
starts	
”	
has	
been	
applied	
to	
both	
the	
motor	
and	
purely	
sensory	
forms	
when	
a	
complaint	
of	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
as	
a	
result	
of	
the	
starts	
is	
present	
.	

A	
prevalence	
of	
60	
%	
to	
70	
%	
has	
been	
reported	
,	
but	
with	
a	
highly	
sporadic	
occurrence	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
affect	
all	
ages	
and	
both	
sexes	
.	

Excessive	
caffeine	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
or	
other	
stimulant	
intake	
,	
prior	
intense	
physical	
work	
or	
exercise	
,	
sleep	
deprivation	
,	
and	
emotional	
stress	
can	
increase	
the	
frequency	
and	
severity	
of	
sleep	
starts	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
are	
an	
essentially	
universal	
component	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
onset	
process	
,	
although	
they	
are	
often	
not	
recalled	
.	

Hypnic	
jerks	
may	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
,	
as	
a	
subjective	
com-	
plaint	
;	
however	
,	
they	
are	
usually	
encountered	
in	
adulthood	
.	

The	
course	
is	
usually	
benign	
.	

Intensified	
sleep	
starts	
may	
lead	
to	
avoidance	
/	
delay	
of	
sleep	
,	
a	
fear	
of	
falling	
asleep	
and	
chronic	
anxiety	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
acute	
and	
chronic	
sleep	
deprivation	
may	
occur	
.	

Sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	
may	
result	
either	
from	
repeated	
awakenings	
induced	
by	
the	
starts	
or	
from	
anxiety	
about	
falling	
asleep	
.	

Injury	
,	
such	
as	
bruising	
a	
foot	
against	
a	
bedstead	
or	
kicking	
a	
sleeping	
companion	
,	
may	
occasionally	
occur	
.	

The	
physiological	
mechanisms	
underlying	
sleep	
starts	
are	
uncertain	
.	

No	
pathologic	
finding	
has	
been	
described	
except	
for	
a	
single	
case	
of	
auditory	
sleep	
starts	
associated	
with	
a	
brainstem	ORGAN
lesion	
.	

Hypnic

However	
,	
the	
similarity	
between	
sleep	
starts	
and	
the	
startle	
response	
has	
led	
some	
to	
postulate	
that	
abnormalities	
of

processing	
are	
primary	
,	
with	
secondary	
motor	
manifestations	
involving	
the	
reticulo-	
spinal	
tract	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
are	
a	
prominent	
symptom	
in	
hereditary	
hyperekplexia	
,	
some	
cases	
of	
which	
are	
caused	
by	
mutations	
in	
the	
glycine	AMINO_ACID
receptor	
.	

It	
has	
also	
been	
postu-	
lated	
that	
sleep	
starts	
are	
a	
response	
to	
hypnagogic	
imagery	
.	

Polysomnographic	
monitoring	
shows	
that	
hypnic	
jerks	
occur	
during	
transitions	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
,	
mainly	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
the	
sleep	
episode	
.	

Superficial	CANCER
EMG	CANCER

)	
high

amplitude	
potentials	
,	
either	
singly	
or	
in	
succession	
.	

The	
EEG	
typically	
shows	
drowsiness	
or	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
patterns	
,	
sometimes	
with	
a	
negative

vertex	
sharp	
wave	
occurring	
at	
the	
time	
of	
the	
jerk	
.	

Autonomic	
activation	
,	
including	
tachycardia	
,	
tachypnea	
or	
irregular	
breathing	
,	
and	
sudomotor	
activation	
may	
follow	
an	
intense	
jerk	
.	

After	
the	
jerk	
,	
a	
brief	
arousal	
or	
a	
return	
to	
sustained	
wakefulness	
may	
occur	
.	

Physical	
and	
neurological	
examinations	
and	
routine	
laboratory	
tests	
are	
otherwise	
normal	
.	

Although	
polysomnography	
is	
not	
necessary	
for	
diagnosis	
in	
most	
individuals	
,	
it	
may	
be	
indicated	
in	
occasional	
cases	
with	
complaints	
of	
insomnia	
and	
frequent	
movements	
.	

Hypnic	
jerks	
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
a	
number	
of	
physiological	
or	
pathologic	
movements	
that	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
or	
during	
sleep	
.	

Physiological

The	
con-

an

especially

.	

Fragmentary	
myoclonus	
occurs	
at	
sleep	
onset	
as	
well	
as	
within	
all	
sleep	
stages	
.	

Contrary	
to	
the	
massive	
jerks	
of	
the	
sleep	
starts	
or	
hypnic	
jerks	
,	
the	
small	
muscle	ORGAN
twitches	
of	
physiological	
partial	
hypnic	
myoclonus	
and	
of	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	
often	
represent	
only	
an	
EMG	CANCER
finding	
and	
are	
not	
associated	
with	
overt	
movements	
at	
the	
joints	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
.	

Normal	
body	
movements	
are	
complex	
,	
with	
body	
postural	
shifts	
usually	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
one	
sleep	
stage	
and	
another

Benign

and	
disappears

PSM	
is	
usually	
a	
chronic	
condition	
associated	
with	
sleep

insomnia	
.	

Excessive	
startling	
and	
hypnic	
jerks	
may	
occur	
as	
part	
of	
the	
hyperekplexia	
syndrome	
,	
in	
which	
generalized	
myoclonus	
is	
readily	
elicited	
by	
stimuli	
during	
either	
wakeful-	
ness	
or	
sleep	
.	

The	
major	
form	
of	
this	
condition	
is	
also	
characterized	
by	
stiffness	
and	
falls	
.	

Brief	
epileptic	
myoclonus	
can	
be	
differentiated	
by	
coexistent	
EEG	CANCER
discharge	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
other	
features	
of	
epileptic	
seizures	
,	
and	
the	
occurrence	
of	
the	
myoclonus	
in	
both	
wakefulness	
and	
during	
sleep

than	
only	
at

firmly	
establish	
another	
diagnosis	
.	

It	
is	
also	
possible	
that	
new	
sleep	
disorders	
that	
do	
not	
fall	
within	
any	
of	
the	
current	
major	
categories	
will	
be	
dis-	
covered	
during	
the	
lifetime	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
.	

When	
a	
specific	
diagnosis	
can	
not	
yet	
be	
determined	
but	
the	
presenting	
problem	
clearly	
falls	
into	
a	
specific	
category	
(	
e.g.	
,	
a	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep	
-	
wake	
dis-	
order	
)	
,	
the	
“	
unspecified	
”	
diagnosis	
within	
that	
category	
(	
e.g.	
,	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep-	
wake	
disorder	
,	
unspecified	
)	
is	
preferred	
.	

The	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
included	
a	
specific	
diagnosis	
of	
environmental	
sleep	
disorder	
within	
this	
section	
.	

This	
diagnosis	
is	
infre-	
quently	
employed	
in	
the	
clinical	
setting	
and	
significant	
controversy	
exists	
regarding	
whether	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	
disturbance	
represents	
a	
clinical	
disorder	
per	
se	
.	

The	
condition	
is	
typically	
characterized	
by	
complaints	
of	
sleep	
initiation	
and/or	
maintenance	
that	
are	
the	
direct	
result	
of	
an	
environmental	
factor	
.	

Associated	
daytime	
symptoms	
such	
as	
sleepiness	
,	
fatigue	
,	
or	
cognitive	
or	
emotional	
disturbance	
may	
be	
present	
.	

The	
environmental	
disturbance	
may	
be	
a	
physical	
stimulus	
such	
as	
noise	
(	
e.g.	
,	
vehicular	
traffic	
,	
aircraft	
,	
bed	
partner	
snoring	
)	
,	
light	
,	
temperature	
,	
movement	
(	
e.g.	
,	
bed	
partner	
movement	
disorder	
or	
parasomnia	
)	
,	
an	
emotional	
stimulus	
such	
as	
environ-	
mental	
danger	
(	
e.g.	
,	
combat	
setting	
or	
disaster	
area	
)	
,	
or	
an	
environmental	
requirement	
(	
such	
as	
caring	
for	
an	
infant	
or	
elderly	
family	
member	
)	
.	

Hospitalization	
is	
often	
cited	
as	
a	
precipitant	
of	
environmental	
sleep	
disturbance	
although	
many	
additional	
factors	
(	
e.g.	
,	
anxiety	
or	
pain	
)	
may	
also	
contribute	
to	
sleep	
disturbance	
in	
this	
setting	
.	

If	
the	
clinician	
determines	
that	
an	
environmental	
factor	
is	
the	
primary	
cause	
of	
a	
sleep	
distur-	
bance	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
Other	
Sleep	
Disorder	
may	
be	
employed	
.	

It	
is	
the	
physical	
aspects	
of	
the	
environment	
,	
rather	
than	
their	
psychological	
meaning	
,	
which	
account	
for	
the	
sleep	
complaint	
.	

Unlike	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
is	
dependent	
on	
the	
presence	
of	
the	
environmental	
factor	
.	

In	
the	
absence	
of	
the	
stimu-	
lus	
,	
sleep	
is	
normal	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	
disturbances	
is	
not	
known	
although	
,	
as	
noted	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
is	
not	
commonly	
reported	
in	
sleep	
centers	
.	

Some	
individuals	
Other	
Sleep	
Disorder	
may	
be	
more	
susceptible	
to	
environmental	
disturbances	
but	
little	
is	
known	
about	
spe-	
cific	
characteristics	
that	
might	
predispose	
to	
this	
condition	
.	

Although	
environmental	
factors	
may	
play	
a	
contributing	
role	
in	
some	
cases	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	
disorder	
,	
multiple	
other	
factors	
account	
for	
that	
condition	
,	
which	
is	
typically	
evident	
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
the	
offending	
environmental	
stimulus	
.	

Distinguishing	
an	
insomnia	
disorder	
from	
an	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	
disturbance	
may	
pose	
a	
challenge	
in	
certain	
clinical	
encounters	
and	
providers	
must	
use	
clinical	
judgment	
in	
establishing	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

In	
behavioral	
insomnia	
of	
childhood	
,	
the	
child	
may	
require	
certain	
environmental	
cir-	
cumstances	
in	
order	
to	
sleep	
(	
e.g.	
,	
a	
pacifier	
,	
music	
,	
lights	
,	
television	
,	
or	
a	
parent	
)	
.	

It	
is	
the	
absence	
of	
these	
circumstances	
that	
results	
in	
sleep	
initiation	
or	
maintenance	
prob-	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE

In	
such	
cases	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia

(	
behavioral

of	
childhood

The	
disorders	
presented	
in	
this	
section	
may	
have	
a	
unique	
presentation	
during	
the	
sleep	
period	
or	
may	
present	
exclusively	
in	
association	
with	
sleep	
.	

Some	
of	
these	
disorders	
(	
e.g.	
,	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	
and	
sleep	
related	
headache	
)	
may	
be	
encountered	
during	
evaluation	
for	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
some	
of	
these	
disorders	
are	
in	
the	
dif-	
ferential	
diagnosis	
of	
other

must	
be

in	
the

of	
certain	
movement	
disorders	
and	
parasomnias	
.	

Sleep	
related	
headaches	
may	
be	
a	
clue	
to	
the	
presence	
of	
sleep	
apnea	
.	

Sleep

may	
either

by	
sleep	
apnea	
with	
aspiration

as	
its	
most	
serious	
consequence	
.	

Sleep

Essential	
Features	
Fatal	
familial	
insomnia	
is	
a	
very	
rare	
,	
progressive	
disorder	
characterized	
by	
initial	
dif-	
ficulties	
in	
falling	
asleep	
and	
maintaining	
sleep	
,	
spontaneous	
lapses	
from	
quiet	
wake-	ORGANISM
fulness	
into	
a	
sleep	
state	
with	
enacted	
dreams	
(	
oneiric	
stupor	
)	
,	
and	
loss	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
features	
.	

In	
later	
stages	
of	
the	
disease	CANCER
,	
it	
may	
not	
be	
possible	
to	
identify	
any	
dis-	
tinct	
sleep	
stages	
.	

Although	
loss	
of	
temporal	
and	
spatial	
orientation	
develops	
,	
cognitive	
function	
is	
retained	
until	
impaired	
alertness	
makes	
testing	
impossible	
.	

The	
disorder	
progresses	
to	
unarousable	
coma	
,	
and	
finally	
,	
death	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Bronchopulmonary	CANCER
and	
other	
infections	
may	
also	
be	
present	
.	

There	
is	
a	
loss	
of	
the	
circadian	
rhythmicity	
of	
endocrine	
rhythms

and	
Complications	

The

is	
always

,	
usually	
within	
eight

The	
course	
is	
one	
of

Essential	
Features	
A	
seizure	
is	
a	
paroxysmal	
event	
resulting	
from	
a	
sudden	
excessive	
discharge	
of	
the	
neurons	CELL
of	
the	
cerebral	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
cortex	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
,	
whereas	
epilepsy	
is	
a	
condition	
of	
recurrent	
unpro-	
voked	
seizures	
.	

Sleep	
facilitates	
epileptic	
activity	
and	
seizures	
.	

The	
characteristics	
of	
specific	
subtypes	
of	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	
are	
discussed	
in	
the	
Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
section	
below	
.	

Associated	
Features	
The	
different	
types	
of	
nocturnal	
frontal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
lobe	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
epilepsy	
(	
NFLE	
)	
may	
cause	
severe	
sleep	
disruption	
,	
affecting	
both	
macrostructure	
and	
microstructure	
of	
sleep	
,	
resulting	
in	
poor	
sleep	
quality	
,	
daytime	
fatigue	
,	
and	
sleepiness	
in	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

The	
movements	
also	
may	
be	
so	
severe	
that	
injuries	
can	
occur	
.	

From	
one	
third	
to	
one	
half	
of	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	
also	
have	
occasional	
attacks	
during	
the	
day	
,	
although	
these	
are	
not	
necessarily	
of	
the	
same	
type	
as	
those	
occurring	
at	
night	
.	

Neurocognitive	
impairment	
is	
typically	
diagnosed	
in	
almost	
all	
cases	
of	
continuous	
spike	
waves	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
(	
CSWS	
)	
.	

Motor	
impairment	
in	
the	
form	
of	
a	
unilat-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
eral	
deficit	
is	
sometimes	
seen	
as	
an	
associated	
feature	
of	
CSWS	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
Clinical	
and	
EEG	
criteria	
are	
used	
to	
define	
a	
variety	
of	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	
subtypes	
.	

Several	
types	
of	
epileptic	
syndromes	
have	
a	
marked	
tendency	
to	
manifest	
only	
or	
pre-	
dominantly	
during	
sleep	
,	
or	
after	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
.	

These	
include	
NFLE	
,	
benign	
epilepsy	
of	
childhood	
with	
centrotemporal	CANCER
spikes	
(	
BECT	
)	
,	
benign	
epilepsy	
with

(	
BEOP	
)	
,	
early

syndrome	
,	
and	
continuous	
spike	
waves	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
(

.	

NFLE	
may	
present	
in	
three	
distinct	
ways	
:	
(	
1	
)	
nocturnal	
paroxysmal	
arousal	
,	
(	
2	
)	
noc-

paroxysmal	
dystonia	
,	
or	
(

)	
episodic	
nocturnal	
wanderings	
.

BECT	
can	
present	
with	
focal	
clonic	
facial	
twitching	
that	
is	
often	
preceded	
by	
perioral	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
numbness	
.	

These	
seizures	
are	
more	
often	
seen	
in	
drowsiness	
and	
sleep	
than	
wakeful-	
ness	
.	

The	
clinical	
course	
is	
often	
benign	
with	
disappearance	
of	
the	
seizures	
in	
adulthood	
.	

BEOP	
is	
characterized	
by	
focal	
seizures	
marked	
by	
deviation	
of	
the	
eyes	ORGAN
and	
vom-	
iting	
.	

Sleep	
is	
the	
main	
precipitating	
factor	
,	
with	
most	
of	
the	
seizures	
occurring	
soon	
after	
sleep	
onset	
or	
in	
the	
early	
hours	
of	
the	
morning	
.	

There	
is	
frequent	
evolution	
to	
secondary	
generalized	
attacks	
.	

The	
clinical	
evolution	
of	
the	
early	
-	
onset	
type	
is	
benign	
,	
whereas	
in	
the	
late	
-	
onset	
type	
with	
visual	
seizures	
,	
the	
prognosis	
is	
uncertain	
.	

JME	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
characterized	
by	
massive	
bilaterally	
synchronous	
myoclonic	
jerks	
,	
which	
are	
most	
frequently	
noted	
on	
awakening	
.	

CSWS	
(	
formerly	
known	
as	
electrical	
status	
epilepticus	
of	
sleep	
[	
ESES

)	
is	
charac-	
terized	
by	
continuous	
and	
diffuse	
slow	
spike

and	
-	
wave	
complexes	
persisting	
through	
NREM	
sleep	
(	
at	
least	
85	
%	
of	
the	
duration	
)	
,	
as	
well	
as	
neuropsychological

motor	
impairment	
.

.	

Perinatal

Familial	
Patterns	

The	
idiopathic	
generalized

form	
the	
largest	
category	
of	
epilepsies	
that	
appear	
to	
be	
heritable	
but	
show	
no	
clear	
mendelian	
mode	
of	
transmission	
.	

Juvenile	
myoclonic	
epilepsy	
and	
idiopathic	
generalized	
epilepsy	
with	
adolescent	
onset	
appear	
to	
be	
genet-	
ically	
heterogeneous	
.	

Among	
the	
partial	
epilepsies	
,	
BECT	
shows	
a	
familial	
pattern	
.	

A	
form	
of	
autosomal	
dominant	
NFLE	
with	
70	
%	
to	
80

penetrance	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
many	
countries	
,	
and	
a	
genetic	
heterogeneity	
also	
has	
been	
reported	
.	

Genetic	
factors	
have	
not	
been	
established	
in	
CSWS	
and	
seem	
to	
play	
a	
minor	
role	
.	

Familial	
anteced-	
ents	
of	
epilepsy	
(	
including	
febrile	
convulsions	
)	
have	
been	
found	
in	
15	
%	
of	
cases	
.

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Idiopathic	
generalized	
epilepsies	
and	
partial	
epilepsy	
may	
start	
at	
any	
age	
.	

The	
onset	
of	
benign	
epilepsies	
of	
childhood	
with	
centrotemporal	
or	
occipital	
spikes	
is	
between	
4	
and	
12	
years	
of	
age	
.	

The	
onset	
of	
NFLE	
is	
generally	
from	
age	
10	
to	
16	
years	
,	
mostly	
before	
the	
age	
of	
20	
years	
.	

The	
average	
age	
of	
recognition	
of	
CSWS	
is	
between	
4	
and	
14	
years	
,	
but	
the	
appearance	
of	
the	
first	
seizure	
is	
early	
,	
typically	
between	
two	
months	
and	
12	
years	
of	
age	
.	

Most	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
recurrent	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	
continue	
to	
have	
seizures	
restricted	
to	
sleep	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
they	
may	
have	
seizures	
during	
both	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

For	
focal	
epilepsies	
(	
excluding	
BECT	
and	
the	
early	
-	
onset	
type	
of	
BEOP	
)	
,	
the	
prognosis	
is	
less	
favorable	
compared	
to	
generalized	
epilepsies	
.	

At	
least	
35	
%	
of	
the	
focal	
seizures	
confined	
to	
sleep	
are	
resistant	
to	
antiepileptic	
drugs	
.	

Definitive	
data	
on	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
NFLE	
are	
not	
available	
,	
although	
a	
high	
prev-	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
alence	
of	
parasomnias	
has	
been	
documented	
in	
NFLE	
patients	ORGANISM
.	

CSWS	
resolves	
in	
many	
cases	
within	
three	
years	
after	
onset	
,	
and	
in	
almost	
all	
cases	
by	
the	
mid	
-	
teen	
years	
.	

Despite	
normalization	
of	
the	
EEG	CANCER
and	
elimination	
of	
seizures	
,	
neuropsychological	
impairment	
may	
persist	
.	

Interictal	
paroxysmal	
activity	
may	
induce	
prolonged	
cognitive	
and	
motor	
impairment	
.	

Hyperkinesias	
,	
aggressiveness	
,	
and	
psy-	
chotic	
states	
may	
appear	
.	

OSA	
may	
exacerbate	
sleep	
related	
seizures	
and	
complicate	
their	
treatment	
.	

Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
In	
idiopathic	
generalized	
epilepsy	
,	
genetic	
factors	
are	
contributory	
.	

Pathogenic	
markers	
,	
associated	
neurologic	
deficits	
,	
or

imaging	
findings	
have	
not	
been	
identified	
.	

However	
,	
microdysgenesis	
has	
been	
described	
in	
some	
forms	
of	
idiopathic	
generalized	
epilepsy	
.	

EEG	
recordings	
with	
sphenoidal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
or	
zygomatic	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
leads	
may	
show	
epileptic	
activity	
over	
the	
mesiotemporal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
regions	
in	
partial	
complex	
seizures	
.	

Video	
-	
polysomnographic	
(	
vPSG	
)	
analysis	
confirms	
that	
the	
motor	
pattern	
of	
NFLE	
resembles	
that	
noted	
in	
orbital	
and	
mesial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
frontal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
seizures	
.	

Nocturnal	
frontal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
lobe	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
sei-	

zures	
involve	
a	
large	
neuronal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
network	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
,	
and	
some	
of	
their	
clinical	
expressions	
are	
pos-	
sible	
consequences	
of	
disinhibition	
of	
innate	
motor	
patterns	
produced	
by	
the	
central	
pattern	
generator	
.	

Recent	
reports	
derived	
from	
stereo	
-	
EEG	
studies	
seem	
to	
show	
that	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
the	
seizures	
(	
in	
particular	
nocturnal	
wanderings	
)	
may	
arise	
from	
temporal	
or	
insular	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
regions	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
(	
rather	
than	
frontal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
regions	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
)	
with	
a	
secondary	
spread	
to	
the	
cingulate	CANCER
regions	
.	

They	
may	
sometimes	
mimic	
parasomnias	
.

CSWS	
associated	
with

(

Objective	
Findings	
Patients	ORGANISM
with	
suspected	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	
often	
need	
to	
be	
evaluated	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
with	
video	
and	
full

head	CANCER
EEG	CANCER
monitoring	
in	
order	
to	
obtain	
the	
correct	
diagnosis	
.	

The	
characteristic	
interictal	
epileptiform	
activity	
in	
idiopathic	
general-	
ized	
epilepsies	
usually	
increases	
during	
NREM	CANCER
sleep	
,	
whereas	
it	
decreases	
during	
REM	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

Interictal	
epileptiform	
activity	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
phasic	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
arousals	
.	

In	
partial	
epilepsies	
,	
the	
interictal	
epileptiform	
activity	
occurs	
in	
a	
localized	
distribu-	
tion	
with	
an	
increase	
in	
spike	
frequency	
in	
stages	
N2	
and	
N3	
compared	
to	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Most	
of	
the	
seizures	
are	
activated	
in	
stage	
N2	
sleep	
.	

Monitoring	
may	
also	
detect	
tran-	
sient	
autonomic	
alterations	
in	
cardiac	ORGAN
rhythm	
,	
blood	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
pressure	
,	
and	
respiration	
during

If

is	
suspected	
,	
a

EEG	
(	
with	
partial	
or	
total	
sleep

the	
night	
before	
,	
as	
indicated	
)	
should	
be	
per-	
formed	
.	

Ambulatory	
24

may	
be	
useful	
to	
detect

Nocturnal

In	
some	
cases	
,	
particularly	
in	
paroxysmal

the	
motor	
attacks	
may	
show	
a	
periodicity	
(	
every	
20	
seconds	
to	
two	
minutes	
)	
.	

Due	
to	
the	
fact	
that	
the

deep	
in	
the	
frontal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
lobe	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
and	
are	
not

EEG	
,	
the	
EEG	CANCER
during	
the	
attacks	
is	
uninformative	
in	
almost	
half	
of	
the	
cases	
.	

In	
a	
few	
cases	
,	
recording	
using	
intracranial	
or	
depth	
electrodes	
confirms	
the	
paroxysms	
during	
or	
preceding	
the	
motor	
components	
.	

The	
interictal

is	
generally	
normal	
,	
but	
in	
30

focal	
epileptic

The

Abnormalities	
arise	
as	
soon	
as	
the	
patients	ORGANISM
fall	
asleep	
and	
dis-	
appear	
abruptly	
on	
awakening

REM	
sleep	
is	
typically	
preserved	
,	
and	
the	
frequency	
of	
spike

discharges	
significantly	
decreases	
but	
the

are	
similar	
to	
those	
in	
the

,	
or

Ictal	
and	
interictal	
EEGs	
are	
often	
normal	
because	
the	
focus	
for	
the	
epileptic	
discharge	
may	
be	
deep	
in	
the	
brain	ORGAN
.	

Disorders

In	
the

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
headaches	
are	
a	
group	
of	
unilateral	
or	
bilateral	
cephalalgias	
of	
varying	
severity	
and	
duration	
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
or	
upon	
awakening	
from	
sleep	
.	

It	
is	
a	
heterogenous	
group	
of	
different	
headache	
entities	
with	
the	
common	
feature	
of	
occur-	ORGAN
rence	
during	
sleep	
or	
upon	
awakening	
.	

The	
characteristics	
of	
specific	
subtypes	
of	
sleep	
related	
headache	
are	
discussed	
in	
the	
Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
section	
below	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Individual	
features	
associated	
with	
specific	
sleep	
related	
headache	
types	
are	
discussed	
in	
the	
following	
section	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
Most	
sleep	
related	
headaches	
are	
daytime	
headache	
conditions	
that	
also	
may	
occur	
during	
sleep	
.	

These	
include	
the	
primary	
headaches	
such	
as	
migraine	
,	
cluster	
head-	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
ache	
,	
and	
chronic	
paroxysmal	
hemicrania	
.	

There	
are	
other	
primary	
headaches	
that	
occur	
solely	
with	
sleep	
;	
for	
example	
,	
hypnic	
headaches	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
secondary	
head-	
aches	
related	
to	
medical	
,	
neurological	
,	
psychiatric	
,	
and	
sleep	
disorders	
can	
cause	
sleep	
related	
headaches	
.	

Migraines	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
are	
common	
recurrent	
headaches	
of	
moderate	
to	
severe	
intensity	
that	
last	
between	
four	
and	
72	
hours	
.	

Pain	
is	
typically	
unilateral	
and	
pulsating	
,	
aggra-	
vated	
by	
routine	
physical	
activity	
and	
associated	
with	
nausea	
,	
and/or	
photophobia	
Appendix	
A	
:	
Sleep	
Related	
Medical	
and	
Neurological	
Disorders	
or	
phonophobia	
.	

They	
occur	
during	
the	
day	
or	
during	
sleep	
;	
approximately	
50	
%	
of	
migraine	
attacks	
occur	
between	
4:00	
a.m.	
and	
9:00	
a.m.	

Migraine	
headaches	
do	
not	
have	
a	
fixed	
association	
with	
a	
particular	
sleep	
stage	
.	

The	
patient	ORGANISM
may	
awaken	
with	
a	
migraine	
out	
of	
REM	
sleep	
,	
or	
the	
headaches	
may	
occur	
in	
relationship	
to	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

A	
“	
classic	
migraine	
”	
headache	
is	
preceded	
by	
an	
aura	
(	
if	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
is	
awake	
)	
,	
which	
usually	
lasts	
four	
to	
60	
minutes	
and	
typically	
consists	
of	
homonymous	
visual	
field	
defects	
and	
scintillating	
scotomas	
.	

In	
some	
patients	ORGANISM
,	
the	
aura	
may	
continue	
or	
even	
begin	
during	
the	
headache	
phase	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
“	
common	
migraine	
”	
does	
not	
start	
with	
an	
aura	
.	

Other	
signs	
of	
neurological	
dysfunction	
may	
include	
unilateral	
paresthesias	
,	
weakness	
,	
and	
aphasia	
.	

Features	
of	
brainstem	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
involvement	
may	
include	
vertigo	
,	
tinni-	
tus	
,	
dysarthria	
,	
decreased	
hearing	
,	
diplopia	
,	
ataxia	
,	
bilateral	
paresthesias	
,	
and	
impaired	
level	
of	
consciousness	
.	

A	
familial	
syndrome	
with	
hemiplegia	
is	
well	
described	
.	

The	
hemiplegia	
is	
ipsilateral	
or	
contralateral	
to	
the	
side	
of	
the	
headache	
.	

Cluster	
headaches	
are	
severe	
,	
unilateral	
,	
periorbital	
or	
temporal	
headaches	
that	
start	
quickly	
and	
peak	
within	
10	
to	
15	
minutes	
.	

They	
have	
a	
relatively	
shorter	
duration	
,	
usually	
lasting	
15	
minutes	
to	
three	
hours	
(	
mean	
,	
60	
minutes	
)	
.	

The	
headaches	
occur	
daily	
during	
cluster	
periods	
—	
usually	
one	
to	
three	
attacks	
per	
day	
over	
a	
period	
of	
one	
to	
two	
months	
.	

Most	
patients	ORGANISM
have	
one	
cluster	
period	
per	
year	
,	
though	
this	
can	
vary	
from	
patient	ORGANISM
to	
patient	ORGANISM
.	

The	
headaches	
tend	
to	
occur	
at	
the	
same	
hour	
each	
day	
,	
with	
75	
%	
of	
cluster	
episodes	
reported	
to	
occur	
between	
9:00	
p.m.	
and	
10:00	
a.m.	

One

,

,	
or

)	
invariably	
accompany	
attacks	
of	
cluster	
headaches	
.	

A	
strong	
predilection	
for	
attacks	
to	
occur	
during	
sleep	
is	
well	
recognized	
,	
and	
these	
attacks	
are	
strongly	
related	
to	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Chronic	
paroxysmal	
hemicrania	
closely	
resembles	
cluster	
headaches	
and	
consists	
of	
severe	
unilateral	
orbital	
,	
supraorbital	
,	
or	
temporal	
pain	
associated	
with	
one	
or	
more	
cranial	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
autonomic	
features	
.	

However	
,	
the	
attacks	
are	
usually	
of	
shorter	
duration	
(	
lasting	
two	
to	
30	
minutes	
)	
and	
occur	
more	
frequently	
,	
most	
often	
at	
a	
frequency	
of	
more	
than	
five	
per	
day	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
cluster	
headaches	
,	
chronic	
paroxysmal	
hemicrania	
is	
exqui-	
sitely	
sensitive	
to	
indomethacin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
.	

Attacks	
are	
also	
strongly	
associated	
with	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Hypnic	
headaches	
are	
an	
uncommon	
type	
of	
headache	
that	
awakens	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
from	
sleep	
with	
a	
generalized	
or	
lateralized	
headache	
that	
lasts	
at	
least	
15	
minutes	
(	
range	
,	
one	
to	
180	
minutes	
)	
with	
a	
frequency	
of	
at	
least	
15	
times	
per	
month	
.	

Onset	
is	
typically	
after	
the	
age	
of	
50	
,	
although	
similar	
headaches	
are	
described	
rarely	
in	
younger	
indi-	
viduals	
,	
including

In

reporting	
that

The

tend	
to

they	
also	
have	
been

One	
study	
from	
a	
head-	
ache	
clinic	
suggested	
that	
17	
%	
of	
all	
headache	
patients	ORGANISM
complain	
of	
nocturnal	
or	
early	
morning	
headaches	
,	
and	
roughly	
half	
of	
these	
were	
related	
to	
an	
identifiable	
sleep	
disorder	
.	

However	
,	
many	
primary	
headache	
disorders	
can	
occur	
during	
sleep	
as	
well	
.	

Sleep

migraines	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
increase	
in	
frequency	
with

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Migraine	
headaches	
have	
several	
predisposing	
factors	
that	
vary	
from	
patient	ORGANISM
to	
patient	ORGANISM
.	

However	
,	
stress	
,	
relaxation	
,	
changes	
in	
weather	
and	
barometric	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
pressure	
,	
changes	
in	
sleep	
pattern	
,	
hypoglycemia	
,	
and	
specific	
foods	
(	
e.g.	
,	
chocolate	
,	
Chinese	
food	
,	
alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
)	
have	
been	
known	
to	
trigger	
migraine	
headaches	
.	

Alcohol	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
can	
also	
predispose	
an	
indi-	
vidual	
to	
having	
cluster	
headache	
and	
chronic	
paroxysmal	
hemicrania	
.	

OSA	
and	
atten-	
dant	
hypoxia	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
a	
trigger	
for	
cluster	
headache	
.	

However	
,	
sleep	
apnea	
may	
also	
predispose	
a	
person	
to	
having	
other	
types	
of	
headache	
and	
may	
inde-	
pendently	
lead	
to	
morning	
headaches	
.	

Change	
of	
sleep	
pattern	
and	
insomnia	
can	
pre-	
dispose	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
to	
developing	
headaches	
.

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Migraine	
headache	
usually	
starts	
in	
the	
second	
or	
third	
decade	
of	
life	
,	
with	
a	
slightly	
earlier	
onset	
in	
men	ORGANISM
than	
in	
women	ORGANISM
.	

The	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
cluster	
headache	
is	
28	
years	
.	

Chronic	
paroxysmal	
hemicrania	
has	
a	
wide	
range	
of	
onset	
,	
from	
childhood	
to	
old	
age	
.	

Most	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
hypnic	
headache	
are	
elderly	
,	
with	
the	
age	
of	
onset	
from	
40	
to	
82	
years	
.	

Brain	CANCER
tumors	CANCER
are	
more	
prevalent	
in	
the	
elderly	
,	
most	
occurring	
from	
the	
fifth	
decade	
to	
late	
life	
.	

Most	
sleep	
related	
headaches	
are	
benign	
and	
tend	
to	
decrease	
in	
frequency	
with	
age	
.	

There	
may	
be	
spontaneous	
remissions	
that	
last	
from	
months	
to	
years	
.	

Pregnancy	
has	
a	
variable	
effect	
on	
these	
headaches

Migraines	
tend	
to	
decrease	
with	
age	
and	
,	
in	
women	ORGANISM
,	
may	
stop	
after	
menopause	
.	

Cluster	
headaches	
,	
as	
the	
name	
suggests	
,	
occur	
in	
clusters	
and	
are	
accompanied	
by	
pain	
-	
free	
intervals	
lasting	
months	
to	
a	
couple	
of	
years	
.	

They	
also	
tend	
to	
decrease	
with	
age	
.	

Hypnic	
headache	
occurs	
infrequently	
.	

Headaches	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
brain	CANCER
tumors	CANCER
are	
related	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
intracranial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
pressure	
and	
tend	
to	
improve	
with	
treatment	
of	
the	
primary	
lesion	
and	
a	
decrease	
in

.	

Some	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
OSA	
report	
improvement	
of	
the	
headache	
after	
treatment	
of	
the	
apnea	
.	

The	
sleep	
related	
headaches	
can	
cause	
sleep	
disruption	
and	
insomnia	
with	
decreased	
sleep	
efficiency	
.	

Cluster	
headaches	
occurring	
regularly	
in	
sleep	
can	
also	
lead	
to

and	
Pathophysiology	
Several	
anatomic	
areas	
are	
common	
to	
the	
physiology	
of	
both	
sleep	
and	
headaches	
;	
these	
include	
the

specifically	
the

perspective	
,	
ade-	CELL

,	
melatonin	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
,	
and	
orexin	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
also	
are	
involved	
in	
both	
the	
regulation	
of	
sleep	
and	
the	
evolution	
of	
headaches	
.	

Dysfunction	
of	
REM	
sleep	
and	
arousal	
mechanisms	
are	
common	
to	
many	
headache	
disorders	
.	

Data	
from	
transgenic	
models	
indicate	
that	
dis-	
ruption	
of	
sleep	
occurs	
in	
two	
forms	
of	
familial	
migraine	
.	

However	
,	
current	
mechanis-	
tic	
explanations	
of	
the	
relationship	
between	
sleep	
and	
headache	
are	
speculative	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnographic	
aspects	
of	
sleep	
related	
headaches	
need	
to	
be	
better	
defined	
.	

Migraine	
headache	
is	
reported	
to	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
REM	
sleep	
or	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

An	
excess	
of	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
also	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
migraine	
.	

However	
,	
large	
controlled	
studies	
are	
not	
available	
.	

Fifty	
percent	
of	
cluster	
headaches	
and	
a	
majority	
of	
chronic	
paroxysmal	
hemicrania	
are	
associated	
with	
REM	
sleep	
.	

OSA	
and	
hypoxia	
during	
sleep	
may	
aggravate	
other	
sleep	
related	
headaches	
or	
may	
be	
an	
independent	
cause	
of	
headache	
.	

Hypnic	
headache	
occurs	
during	
sleep	
,	
with	
recent	
reports	
of	
headache	
during	
REM	
sleep	
and	
uncommonly	
during	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

Thus	
,	
the	
majority	
of	
sleep	
related	
headaches	
seem	
to	
have	
some	
relationship	
with	
REM	
sleep	
,	
but	
there	
are	
no

pathognomonic	
polysomnographic

or	
infectious	
disease	
processes	
that

are	
a	
heterogeneous	
group	
of	
different	
headache	
entities	
with	
a	
common	
expression	
of	
occurrence	
during

.	

They	
need	
to	
be	
differentiated	
from	
other

Findings	
Sleep

laryngospasm	
may	
be	
observed	
on	
PSG	
with	
accompanying	
audio	
record-

.	

It	
is	
seen	
in	
all	
stages	
of	
sleep	
but	
is	
most	
severe	
in	
REM

Laryngospasm	
can	
appear	
to	
be	
similar	
to	
snoring	
on	
the	
polysomnographic	
snoring	
channel	
,	
but	
the	
audio	
recording	
will	
confirm	
the	
high

sound	
as	
laryngospasm	
.	

OSA	
has	
also	
been	
detected	
in	
some	
cases	
.	

Patients	ORGANISM
or	
family	
members	
may	
mistake	
laryngospasm	
for	
snoring	
or	
sleep

Sleep

reflux	
may	
result	
in	
coughing

episodes	
during	
the

these

usually	
are

One	
possible

laryngospasm	
may	
be	
occult

However	
,	
sleep

Sleep	
Related

and	
Neurological	
Disorders	
Pathology	CANCER
and	
Pathophysiology	
Two	
major	
pathophysiologic	
mechanisms	
cause	
individual	
reflux	
episodes	
.	

Transient	
LES	
relaxations	
(	
LES	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
relaxations	
occurring	
without	
esophageal	CANCER
contractions	CANCER
)	
account	
for	
53	
%	
to	
74	
%	
of	
GER	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
episodes	
.	

Transient	
LES	
relaxations	
decrease	
the	
LES	
pres-	
sure	
to	
the	
gastric	ORGAN
pressure	
gradient	
,	
facilitating	
the	
retrograde	
flow	
of	
gastric	ORGAN
contents	
.	

An	
LES	
pressure	
of	
10	
mm	
Hg	
or	
less	
is	
the	
second	
mechanism	
by	
which	
intra	
-	
abdom-	
inal	
pressure	
overcomes	
the	
LES	
pressure	
,	
resulting	
in	
the	
retrograde	
flow	
of	
gastric	ORGAN
contents	
into	
the	
esophagus	ORGAN
.	

Pathophysiology	
of	
sleep	
related	
GER	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
is	
similar	
to	
diurnal	
GER	CANCER
(	
i.e.	
,	
transient	
LES	
relaxations	
and	
a	
low	
LES	
pressure	
)	
.	

However	
,	
sleep	
impacts	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
physiology	
through	
the	
impairment	
of	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
acid	
clearance	
mechanisms	
when	
GER	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
events	
occur	
.	

With	
sleep	
onset	
,	
the	
upper	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
sphincter	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
(	
UES	
)	
pressure	
decreases	
and	
is	
lowest	
during	
N3	
sleep	
,	
thus	
predisposing	
to	
aspiration	
.	

The	
UES	
contractile	
reflex	
remains	
intact	
during	
sleep	
,	
including	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Lower	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
sphincter	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
(	
LES	
)	
pressure	
remains	
unchanged	
during	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
increases	
the	
vagal	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
threshold	
for	
trig-	
gering	
transient	
LES	
relaxations	
,	
so	
they	
usually	
do	
not	
occur	
during	
stable	
sleep	
and	
are	
usually	
confined	
to	
arousals	
.	

When	
GER	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
events	
occur	
during	
sleep	
,	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
refluxate	
clearance	
is	
prolonged	
and	
an	
arousal	
is	
required	
.	

Sleep	
facilitates	
proxi-	
mal	
refluxate	
migration	
toward	
the	
UES	
.	

Saliva	CELL
secretion	
,	
with	
its	
acid	
-	
neutralizing	
bicarbonate	
,	
ceases	
during	
sleep	
.	

Swallowing	
,	
required	
for	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
peristalsis	
and	
refluxate	
clearance	
,	
does	
not	
occur	
during	
sleep	
and	
is	
dependent	
on	
an	
arousal	
.	

Sleep	
also	
delays	
gastric	ORGAN
emptying	
by	
disrupting	
gastromyoelectric	
function	
.	

Events	
causing	
arousals	
,	
including	
periodic	
limb	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION
movements	
and	
apneas	
,	
could	
trigger	
transient	
LES	
relaxations	
and	
thus	
GER	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
events	
.	

Because	
refluxate	
clearance	
requires	
an	
arousal	
,	
medications	
decreasing	
the	
arousal	
response	
(	
including	
benzodiazepines	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
and	
zolp-	
idem	
)	
may	
prolong	
refluxate	
clearance	
and	
increase	
the	
risk	
of	
aspiration	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
pathology	
of	
GER	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT
includes	
abnormal	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
manometry	
,	
endoscopy	
,	
and	
esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
biopsy	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
findings	
.	

Esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION

esophageal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
peristaltic	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION

An	
acid

event	
is	
defined	
when	
the	
pH	
drops	
to	
less

is	
reported	
as

The

Essential	
Features	
Sleep

ischemia	
is	
characterized	
by	
nocturnal	
reduction	
of	
blood	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
flow	
to	
the	
myocardium	TISSUE
,	
typically	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
symptoms	
of	
sleep	
related	
myo-	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
cardial	
ischemia	
are	
very	
similar	
to	
those	
that	
characterize	
episodes	
of	
cardiac	ORGAN
isch-	
emia	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL
during	
the	
daytime	
.	

Classically	
,	
there	
is	
a	
feeling	
of	
chest	
pressure	
or	
pain	
that	
awakens	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
from	
sleep	
and	
may	
be	
described	
as	
a	
“	
viselike	
”	
discomfort	
.	

The	
discomfort	
may	
radiate	
to	
the	
chin	
and	
jaw	CANCER
and	
to	
the

especially	
the

Features	
Acute	
episodes	
of

sometimes	
elicit	
atrial	
or	
ventric-	
ular

Other	
associated	
presentations	
include	
acute	
onset	
of	
shortness	
of	
breath	
that	
wakes	
the	
patient	ORGANISM
from

that	
may

secondary	
to	
left	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
ventricular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
diastolic	
dysfunction	
or	
ischemic	
mitral	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
regurgitation	
.	

Other	
related	
features	
depend	
on	
the	
trigger	
for	
the	
cardiac	ORGAN
ischemia	
.	

Ischemic	
events	
related	
to	
OSA	
may	
present	
during	
those	
times	
of

Demographics	

The	
specifics

,	
sex	
ratios

and

ranges	
have	
not	
been	
comprehensively	
evaluated	
.	

Some	
insights	
into	
demographics	
can	
be	
extrapolated	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
cause	
of	
nocturnal	
angina	
.	

For	
sleep	
related	
myocardial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
ischemia	
triggered	
by	
OSA	
,	
the	
preponderance	
of	
OSA	
in	
men	ORGANISM
suggests	
that	
middle	
-	
aged	
men	ORGANISM
with	
severe	
OSA	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
experience	
nocturnal	
angina	
,	
particularly	
if	
they	
have	
more	
severe	
coronary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
.	

Variant	
angina	
(	
also	
referred	
to	
as	
vasospastic	
or	
Prinzmetal	
angina	
)	
more	
commonly	
affects	
younger	
populations	
,	
particularly	
women	ORGANISM
and	
those	
of	
Asian	
descent	
.	

Cardiac	ORGAN
ischemia	
secondary	
to	
nocturnal	
hypotension	
is	
more	
com-	
monly	
manifested	
in	
older	
individuals	
,	
particularly	
those	
with	
severe	
vasculopathy	
who	
are	
taking	
multiple	
antihypertensive	
medications	
,	
and	
especially	
those	
in	
whom	
autonomic	
dysfunction	
(	
related	
to	
either	
age	
or	
diabetes	
)	
may	
impair	
blood	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
pressure	
homeostatic	
mechanisms	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Predisposing	
factors	
include	
established	
coronary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
or	
valvular	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
such	
as	
aortic	
stenosis	
.	

Because	
coronary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
filling	
occurs	
during	
diastole	
,	
conditions	
associated	
with	
reduced	
diastolic	
blood	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE
pressure	
,	
such	
as	
severe	
aortic	
regurgita-	ORGANISM
tion	
,	
may	
elicit	
nocturnal	
angina	
,	
particularly	
in	
the	
presence	
of	
preexisting	
coro-	

nary	
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
.	

Similarly	
,	
any	
predisposition	
to	
hypotension	
,	
which	
is	
most	
likely	
to	
occur	
during	
slow	
wave	
(	
N3	
)	
sleep	
,	
may	
heighten	
risk	
.	

Usual	
risk	
factors	
for	
coronary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
artery	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
disease	
that	
predispose	
an	
individual	
to	
the	
development	
of

related	
myocardial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
ischemia	
include	
hypertension	
,	
diabetes	
mellitus	
,	
cigarette	
smoking	
,	
and	
hyperlipidemia	
.	

Retrospective	
and	
prospective	
studies	
suggest	
that	
OSA	
may	
be	
a	
trigger	
for	
myo-	
cardial	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE
infarction	
and	
sudden	
death	
that	
occurs	
at	
night	
.	

Deeper

desaturations

may	
be

,	
particularly	
with	
coexisting	
pulmonary	ORGAN

or	
truncal	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
-	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION
abdominal	
obesity	
,	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
trigger	
cardiac	ORGAN
ischemia	
.	

In	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
vasospastic	
angina	
,	
use	
of	
nonselective	
β	
-	
adrenergic	
receptor	
-	
blocking	
agents	
may	
theoretically	
increase	
the	
likelihood	
of	
vasospasm	
.	

In	
patients	ORGANISM
with	
nocturnal

secondary	
to	
hypotension	
,	
an	
excess	
of

pertensive	
medications	
,	
as	
well	
as	
long	
-	
acting	
nitroglycerin	
administered	
prior	
to	
sleep	
,	
may	
contribute	
.	

Finally	
,	
in	
the

,	
abuse	
of	
drugs	
such	
as

Variant

Electrocardiographic

horizontal

of	
greater

The

coronary	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE

is	
sometimes	
unaccompanied	
by	
chest

(	
silent

)	
and	
may	
be	
incidentally	
noted	
on	
either	
Holter	
monitoring	
or	
telemetry	
.	

In	
general	
,	
ST	
segment	
abnormalities	
indicative	
of	
myocardial	TISSUE

are	
1

more	
horizontal

However	
,	
because	
the

poor

The

from

which

The	
nature

are	
helpful	
in	
making	
a	
distinction

although	
12

necessary	
in	
some

ciated	
with

Although	
the

have	
a

Nocturnal

,	
although	
typical

chest

other	
thoracic	ORGAN

should	
be	
considered	
in

.	

Chest

may	
be	
sec-	
ondary	
to	
a	
variety

causes	
such	
as
