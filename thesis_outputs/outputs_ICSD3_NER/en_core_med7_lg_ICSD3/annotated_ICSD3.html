Introduction Classification of disorders plays several key roles in medicine.</br>The most familiar of these is that is serves as a guide to clinicians in the identification of specific disease states.</br>In doing so, classification systems provide clinicians with important informa- tion regarding numerous related factors including pathogenesis, prognosis, course, and heritability.</br>Moreover, therapeutic interventions are largely guided by the nosologi- cal decisions made by clinicians.</br>In turn, information accrued regarding therapeutic response of these disease states is utilized to further refine the nosology.</br>Classification systems also serve to define the domain of a given discipline, a factor of particular importance for fields such as sleep medicine which cut across many related special- ties.</br>Finally, by identifying areas of uncertainty and overlap among related patholo- gies, these systems play a critical role in guiding future research agendas which will enhance our knowledge and understanding of the clinical features, pathophysiology and treatment response specific to each disorder. </br>Since its infancy 35 years ago, the field of sleep medicine has paid particular atten- tion to the issue of classification, beginning with the 1979 American Sleep Disorders Association’s Diagnostic Classification of Sleep and Arousal Disorders.</br>Since that time, as our knowledge and understanding of sleep disorders has grown, several differ- ent structural approaches have been utilized in revisions of the classification system, culminating in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition.</br>The organization of that edition, although not without its limitations, has proven effective and user-friendly and has been maintained in the current revision. </br>Ideally, classification systems are based largely on pathophysiology.</br>However, such an approach is dependent on adequate knowledge concerning the various pathophysiol- ogies of disease or disorder within a given discipline.</br>As is the case with many diag- nostic systems, our current knowledge and understanding of the pathophysiology of many sleep disorders is inadequate.</br>As a result, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, not unlike its predecessors, employs a hybrid approach which utilizes pathophysiology, where known, but also relies heavily on phenomenology and organ system approaches.</br>Despite these shortcomings, this approach is one that has proven familiar and workable for sleep medicine clinicians. </br>Recognizing the need for currency and relevance in a rapidly evolving field, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Board of Directors approved a revision of International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition in 2011.</br>Following appoint- ment of a chair/editor, a task force, consisting of individual work group chairs for each Introduction major division of the manual, was selected, along with two pediatric consultants.</br>A focus group of experts was convened in June 2011 to obtain input on major structural and content issues.</br>Based on this feedback, individual work groups then set about to define the list of disorders to be included within their sections as well as proposed cri- teria for each diagnosis.</br>This process included comprehensive literature searches for every potential diagnosis as well as for their major features.</br>The draft diagnostic crite- ria which emanated from this work were then reviewed and modified by the task force (consisting of the work group chairs and pediatric advisors), as well as by the board of the AASM.</br>The edited criteria were then distributed to external peer reviewers with expertise in the respective areas, as well as to international societies and membership sections of the AASM for comment.</br>These reviews were carefully considered and revi- sions made based on this input.</br>Subsequent to this, text revisions were begun and the same review process and modifications were undertaken once text drafts were com- pleted.</br>Further modifications were made based on recommendations from the AASM board before finalization of the edition.</br>At all points in this process, efforts were made to rely as heavily as possible on available and current scientific evidence.</br>However, due to the paucity of available evidence in many areas, decisions regarding the nosol- ogy were often made by consensus of the work groups, task force, and reviewers. </br>Using ICSD-3 As noted above, the general structure of the current edition closely parallels that of the second edition.</br>The major clinical divisions remain unchanged.</br>As with International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition, pediatric diagnoses are fully integrated into the major clinical diagnoses, with the exception of obstructive sleep apnea, pediatric.</br>Where pediatric presentations call for variation in the diagnostic criteria, those variations are noted within the criteria section.</br>In an effort to better identify those clinical features of a disorder which are developmentally-specific, a text heading for Developmental Issues has been added for each diagnosis.</br>Specific ICD codes (9-CM and 10-CM) are listed at the beginning of each diagnosis.</br>Because of the complexities and differences between International Classification of Sleep Disorders diagnoses and the ICD system, assign- ment of codes is challenging.</br>These issues are discussed further under Coding below. </br>Although classification systems are, by their nature, intended to define disorders in the most specific terms possible, clinicians must recognize that there is inevitably some degree of variability in presentation which may result in clinically significant conditions which do not meet all specific criteria for a given diagnosis.</br>Therefore, some degree of judgment is necessary in the application of these criteria.</br>Bearing this exception in mind, all listed criteria should generally be met for establishment of a given diagnosis, unless otherwise specified.</br>Clinicians should note that most diagnoses within the International Classification of Sleep Disorders include a criterion, or cri- teria, that connote clinical significance (i.e., disturbing symptoms, significant conse- quences, distress or impairment in one or more functional realms).</br>These criteria are particularly important because, without them, many phenomena related to sleep-wake do not rise to a level that requires clinical attention and treatment.</br>Users should also pay particular attention to the Notes section (where included), as these notes provide essential definitions and details concerning application of the criteria. </br>Clinicians will note a number of significant content changes from the former edition.</br>The most apparent of these is the collapse of all previous chronic insomnia diagnoses into a single chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis.</br>The rationale for this is described in the introductory section of Insomnia disorders.</br>A separate diagnosis is retained for short-term insomnia.</br>Within the Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence section, the nomenclature for narcolepsy has been changed to narcolepsy type 1 and type 2.</br>This modification is discussed in the introduction to that section.</br>Users will also find several new diagnoses within the Sleep Related Breathing Disorders.</br>Within the Central Sleep Apnea Syndromes, a diagnosis of treatment-emergent central sleep apnea now appears.</br>This term is preferred to the widely used term complex sleep apnea because it describes a more specific and well-defined disorder in which the central apnea arises in the context of positive airway pressure treatment for obstructive sleep apnea and is not attributable to another cause.</br>Central sleep apnea associated with other identi- fiable etiologies such as Cheyne-Stokes breathing or substance-induced central sleep apnea are not classified as treatment-emergent.</br>Assigning a diagnosis of a sleep related hypoventilation disorder requires demonstration of elevated PaCO2 (by direct measure of arterial blood gas or, more commonly, by proxy measures such as end-tidal or trans- cutaneous CO2 determination).</br>The new diagnosis of sleep related hypoxemia disor- der should be employed when there is sustained drop in SaO2 but PaCO2 has not been measured.</br>Within the parasomnia section, a single set of general criteria and a unified text now describe disorders of arousal from non-rapid eye movement sleep, although additional, specific criteria and separate coding are maintained for the diagnoses within this section (i.e., confusional arousal, sleepwalking and sleep terror).</br>Other, somewhat less consequential additions, deletions and reassignment of diagnoses also appear in this edition.</br>International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition contained a separate chapter for Isolated Symptoms and Normal Variants.</br>A small number of these were felt to qualify as formal diagnoses at this time and have been moved to relevant sections.</br>Other symptoms and variants appear at the conclusion of the chapter to which they are most applicable (e.g., snoring to the Sleep Related Breathing Disorders, long sleeper to Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence, and movement related variants to the Sleep Related Movement Disorder section). </br>15 Introduction Introduction A wealth of information regarding each diagnosis is contained within the separate text headings within each diagnostic section.</br>The outline below details some of the spe- cific content to be found within each text heading.</br>These terms are not indexed in the hard copy version of this manual because they appear throughout the document.</br>Users should refer to the relevant text heading within a specific diagnosis for information related to these terms: Alternate Names Diagnostic Criteria Essential Features

gas ◦ Pulmonary function ◦</br>Ventilatory response • Cardiac ◦</br>Electrocardiogram ◦</br>Echocardiogram ◦ Cardiac catheterization • Serum chemistry Relationship to Other Classification Systems Historically, there have been three major classifications systems for sleep disorders.</br>Although the International Classification of Sleep Disorders system has, for many years, been the primary nosology for sleep medicine specialists, both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) nosology of the World Health Organization have also classified sleep disorders.</br>Unfortunately, these competing systems have differed significantly in structure and content over the years.</br>Development of DSM-5 was ongoing during the development of this manual and an effort was undertaken to achieve the greatest degree of concordance possible between these two systems, recognizing that the International Classification of Sleep Disorders will inevitably contain a greater level of detail than DSM due to differences in their target users.</br>This goal was largely achieved although some differences will still exist.</br>The major change to the Insomnia section (i.e. establishment of a single chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis) within this new system is paralleled in DSM-5.</br>Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence diagnoses are organized somewhat differently in the DSM clas- sification than in this manual and narcolepsy criteria differ slightly.</br>Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorder diagnoses are identical within the two systems with the exception that DSM does not include a jet lag disorder.</br>Sleep Related Breathing Disorders are significantly more detailed within International Classification of Sleep Disorders than DSM-5, although the organizational structures in this section are quite similar.</br>Sleep Related Movement Disorders and Parasomnias are likewise similar but with fewer overall diagnoses within DSM-5. </br>With the publication of International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition, a major effort to expand and reorganize sleep related diagnoses within ICD-9-CM was undertaken.</br>This effort resulted in the inclusion of many additional sleep related diag- noses in ICD-9-CM (primarily within the Diseases of the Nervous System section).</br>The archaic distinction between “organic” and “non-organic” disorders has histori- cally been a guiding principle of ICD, resulting in dissemination of sleep diagnoses to both the neurological and mental disorder categories.</br>Clinicians familiar with the ICD- 9-CM categories which have been employed since the most recent changes will find general concordance between the assigned diagnostic codes found herein and the most current version of ICD-9-CM.</br>These ICD-9-CM codes for sleep disorders are essen- tially carried over to ICD-10-CM.</br>However, certain content revisions in International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition (e.g., chronic insomnia) necessitates a significant departure from the coding approach utilized in ICD-9-CM and International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition.</br>This is discussed further below. </br>17 Introduction Introduction Coding Diagnostic codes for the relevant ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnoses can be found at the beginning of each diagnosis section of the book.</br>In the United States, the former codes (ICD-9-CM) should be employed until the implementation date for ICD-10-CM which, at the time of this writing, is to be no sooner than October 1, 2015.</br>Following that date, only the ICD-10-CM codes should be used.</br>As already stated, clinicians should recognize that there is not precise concordance between the assigned codes for International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition diagnoses and the diagno- ses listed within ICD.</br>Changes to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders classification system are not reflected in the ICD system for many years.</br>Moreover, the ICD classification of sleep disorders has historically been significantly less detailed than ICSD (particularly for international users not employing the Clinical Modification (CM) version used in the United States).</br>Hence, clinicians will find many areas in which assigned codes found in this manual do not correspond as closely as one would like to ICD codes.</br>Most notably, with the collapse of chronic insomnia diagnoses into a single disorder in International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, the assigned codes for this diagnosis within International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition are 307.42 (ICD-9-CM) – “Nonorganic persistent disorder of initiating or maintaining sleep” and F51.01 (ICD-10-CM) – “Primary insomnia.”</br>A variety of other insomnia diagnoses will continue to appear in the ICD system but, with the classifi- cation and coding changes recommended herein, these become essentially defunct for sleep medicine clinicians.</br>In summary, the assigned codes in this edition represent “best approximations” to the corresponding ICD codes, but some degree of discrep- ancy between the systems will exist in a number of areas. </br>18 Insomnia Chronic Insomnia

.................................................................................</br>47 Short Sleeper................................................................................................47 </br>This section includes sleep disorders chiefly characterized by the complaint of insom- nia.</br>For the purpose of this manual, insomnia is defined as a persistent difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that occurs despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and results in some form of daytime impair- ment.</br>These three components of insomnia—persistent sleep difficulty, adequate sleep opportunity, and associated daytime dysfunction—are collectively implied by text references to the term insomnia.</br>Among adults with insomnia, sleep complaints most typically include difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep.</br>Concerns about lengthy periods of nocturnal wakefulness, insufficient amounts of nocturnal sleep, or poor sleep quality often accompany these complaints.</br>Individuals who report these sleep related symptoms in the absence of daytime impairment are not regarded as having an insomnia disorder that warrants clinical attention other than education and reassurance.</br>Insomnia among children is often reported by their caretakers and char- acterized by bedtime resistance, frequent nighttime awakenings and/or an inability to sleep independently.</br>Regardless of the exact nature of the nocturnal sleep concerns, daytime impairments are reported, presumably caused by the nighttime sleep diffi- culties or by some common but unidentified mechanism during sleep and wakeful- ness.</br>Daytime symptoms typically include fatigue, decreased mood or irritability, general malaise, and cognitive impairment.</br>Among adults, chronic insomnia may impair social or vocational functioning and reduce quality of life, whereas in chil- dren it may lead to poor school performance, impaired attention, and behavioral disturbance.</br>In some patients, physical symptoms such as muscle tension, palpita- tions, or headache may also be attributed to the insomnia.</br>Others with more severe forms of insomnia may be at increased risk for motor vehicle and work-site acci- dents as well as psychiatric and cardiovascular disorders.</br>Insomnia often accompa- nies comorbid medical illnesses, mental disorders, and other sleep disorders.</br>It may also arise in association with the use, abuse, or exposure to certain substances.</br>When insomnia occurs comorbid to these conditions and is persistent and prominent, a sep- arate insomnia diagnosis is warranted. </br>19 Insomnia The insomnia nosology presented in this text represents a marked departure from the previous International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition insomnia classification system in terms of its conceptual framework and relative simplicity.</br>The previous insomnia nosology of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders promoted the concept that insomnia can exist as a primary sleep disorder or arise as a secondary form of sleep disturbance related to an underlying primary psychiatric, medical, or substance abuse disorder.</br>However, many symptoms and associated fea- tures of so-called primary and secondary insomnias are overlapping, thus making differentiation among such subtypes difficult, if not impossible.</br>There is increas- ing recognition that even when insomnia arises “secondary” to another condition, it often develops an independent course over time and may remain as a clinically significant condition, even if the so-called primary condition is adequately treated.</br>Evidence suggests that insomnia, if left untreated, may adversely affect the outcome of these comorbid conditions.</br>Moreover, it appears that treatment of the insomnia may improve outcome of both the sleep disturbance and the comorbid conditions.</br>Given these observations, insomnia seems best viewed as a comorbid disorder that warrants separate treatment attention. </br>In addition to the primary vs. secondary insomnia distinction, prior editions of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders delineated multiple putative “primary insomnia” diagnostic subtypes.</br>Specifically, both the original 1990 version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition described primary insomnia subtypes such as psycho- physiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, inadequate sleep hygiene, and paradox- ical insomnia, as discrete diagnostic entities.</br>Experience suggests that, in practice, it is rare to encounter patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for exclusively one of these subtypes.</br>In fact, many of the diagnostic criteria delineated for these subtypes represent generic characteristics (e.g., engaging in sleep-disruptive habits; underesti- mation of sleep time, evidence of conditioned arousal) of insomnia, per se, and do not facilitate discrimination among these subtypes or between these subtypes and those presumed to have “secondary” forms of insomnia. </br>Both clinical experience and a growing body of empirical findings have shown that the diagnostic distinctions advocated by previous versions of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders are difficult to reliably ascertain and are of question- able validity.</br>In view of such considerations, the current manual abandons the previ- ously employed complex and highly specific insomnia classification scheme described by the original International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the 2nd Edition in favor of a more global and defensible nosology. </br>20 The manual includes three diagnostic categories for insomnia: chronic insomnia disorder, short-term insomnia disorder, and other insomnia disorder.</br>These diag- noses apply to patients with and without comorbidities regardless of whether those comorbidities are viewed as potentially sleep disruptive.</br>Chronic insomnia disorder is characterized by chronic sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance complaints with asso- ciated daytime impairment, and is reserved for individuals whose sleep difficulties exceed minimal frequency and duration thresholds shown to be associated with clin- ically significant morbidity outcomes.</br>Short-term insomnia disorder is characterized by sleep/wake difficulties that fail to meet the minimal frequency and duration criteria of chronic insomnia disorder.</br>Nonetheless, short-term insomnia disorder is associated with clinically significant sleep dissatisfaction or waking impairment.</br>Other insomnia disorders should be assigned to those rare cases that fail to meet criteria for short- term insomnia disorder, yet are thought to have sufficient symptoms of insomnia to warrant clinical attention. </br>Chronic Insomnia Disorder ICD-9-CM code: 307.42 ICD-10-CM code:</br>F51.01 Alternate Names Chronic insomnia, primary insomnia, secondary insomnia, comorbid insomnia, disor- der of initiating and maintaining sleep, behavioral insomnia of childhood, sleep-onset association disorder, limit-setting sleep disorder. </br>Diagnostic Criteria Criteria A-F must be met A.</br>The patient reports, or the patient’s parent or caregiver observes, one or more of the following:1 .</br>Difficulty initiating sleep. </br>2. Difficulty maintaining sleep. </br>3. Waking up earlier than desired. </br>4.</br>Resistance to going to bed on appropriate schedule. </br>5.</br>Difficulty sleeping without parent or caregiver intervention. </br>B. The patient reports, or the patient’s parent or caregiver observes, one or more of the following related to the nighttime sleep difficulty: . Fatigue/malaise. </br>2. Attention, concentration, or memory impairment. </br>3. Impaired social, family, occupational, or academic performance. </br>Insomnia Insomnia .</br>Mood disturbance/irritability. </br>5. Daytime sleepiness. </br>6.</br>Behavioral problems (e.g., hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression).</br>7. Reduced motivation/energy/initiative. </br>8.</br>Proneness for errors/accidents. </br>9.</br>Concerns about or dissatisfaction with sleep. </br>C. The reported sleep/wake complaints cannot be explained purely by inadequate opportunity (i.e., enough time is allotted for sleep) or inadequate circumstances (i.e., the environment is safe, dark, quiet, and comfortable) for sleep. </br>D. The sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms occur at least three times per week. </br>E. The sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms have been present for at least three months.2 F. The sleep/wake difficulty is not better explained by another sleep disorder. </br>Notes .</br>Reports of difficulties initiating sleep, difficulties maintaining sleep, or waking up too early can be seen in all age groups.</br>Resistance going to bed on an appropriate schedule and difficulty sleeping without parent or caregiver intervention is seen most commonly in children and older adults who require the supervision of a caretaker due to a significant level of functional impairment (e.g., those with dementia). </br>2. Some patients with chronic insomnia may show recurrent episodes of sleep/wake difficulties lasting several weeks at a time over several years, yet not meet the three-month duration criterion for any single such episode.</br>Nonetheless, these patients should be assigned a diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder, given the persistence of their intermittent sleep difficulties over time. </br>3.</br>Some patients who use hypnotic medications regularly may sleep well and not meet the criteria for an insomnia disorder when they take such medications.</br>However, in the absence of such medications these same patients may meet the above criteria.</br>This diagnosis would apply to those patients particularly if they present clinically and voice concerns about their inability to sleep without their sleep medications. </br>4.</br>Many comorbid conditions such as chronic pain disorders or gast- roesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may cause the sleep/wake complaints delineated here.</br>When such conditions are the sole cause of the sleep difficulty, a separate insomnia diagnosis may not apply.</br>However, in many patients such conditions are chronic and are not the sole cause of sleep difficulty.</br>Key determining factors in the decision to invoke a separate insomnia diagnosis include: “How much of the time does the sleep difficulty arise as a result of factors directly attributable to the comorbid condition (e.g., pain or GERD)?”</br>or “Are there times that the sleep/wake complaints occur in the absence of these factors?”</br>“Have perpetuating cognitive or behavioral factors (e.g., negative expectations, conditioned arousal, sleep-disruptive habits) arisen, suggesting an autonomous aspect to the ongoing insomnia?”</br>If there is evidence that the patient’s sleep/ wake complaints are not solely caused by the medical condition, and those sleep/wake complaints seem to merit separate treatment attention, then a diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder should be made. </br>Essential Features The essential feature of chronic insomnia disorder is a frequent and persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep that results in general sleep dissatisfaction.</br>The sleep complaint is accompanied by distress about poor sleep and/or impairment in family, social, vocational, academic, or other important areas of functioning.</br>Furthermore, the sleep disturbance and associated waking symptoms occur despite having adequate time and circumstances each night to obtain necessary sleep.</br>Chronic insomnia dis- order can occur in isolation or comorbidly with a mental disorder, medical condition, or substance use. </br>The sleep complaints that comprise chronic insomnia disorder may include difficul- ties initiating sleep or difficulties maintaining sleep.</br>The latter complaint may include waking up during the night with difficulty returning to sleep or having a final awaken- ing occurring too early, well before the desired rising time.</br>Chronic insomnia disorder may be characterized solely by sleep onset or sleep maintenance complaints or, more commonly, by both types of complaints occurring together.</br>Individuals’ sleep com- plaints may also change over time such that those with solely sleep onset complaints may subsequently develop sleep maintenance complaints and vice versa.</br>Also, those who present initially with mixed sleep onset and sleep maintenance difficulties may later evidence one or the other of these difficulties but not both.</br>Complaints about poor-quality, unrefreshing, or nonrestorative sleep often accompany sleep onset and sleep maintenance complaints, but do not suffice to define insomnia disorder when occurring as the sole sleep complaint. </br>The degree of sleep disturbance required to assign a chronic insomnia disorder diag-</br>nosis is somewhat arbitrary in that it relies primarily on individuals’ subjective sleep Insomnia Insomnia complaints.</br>Moreover, the degree of sleep disturbance required to connote clinical significance varies across age groups.</br>Nonetheless, sleep onset latencies and periods of wakefulness after sleep onset &gt; 20 minutes generally connote clinically significant sleep disturbances in children and young adults.</br>In middle and older aged adults, onset latencies and periods of wakefulness during sleep &gt; 30 minutes typically connote clin- ical significance.</br>Complaints of early morning awakening are less well defined, but typically entail the termination of sleep at least 30 minutes before the desired rising time and a concomitant reduced total sleep time compared with the usual premorbid sleep pattern.</br>The exact time at which early morning awakenings occur may vary con- siderably as a function of 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #f58231; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    usual bedtimes

</mark>
.</br>For example, a final awakening at 4:00 a.m. is likely to connote clinical significance when the usual bedtime is 11:00 p.m.</br>but not when the usual bedtime occurs at 9:00 p.m. Symptoms during wakefulness accompany the sleep difficulties and result in the impairment of normal functioning.</br>Common waking symptoms include fatigue; reduced motivation; reduced concentration, attention, and memory functioning; and irritability or reduced mood.</br>Complaints of subjective daytime sleepiness are also common, although, in contrast to patients with hypersomnolence conditions, many with this complaint are not able to nap in the daytime and few show unintentional sleep episodes.</br>Reports of reduced performance at work or school or impaired social functioning also are common.</br>Some affected individuals attribute errors or accidents at work to their sleep difficulties.</br>Somatic symptoms such as headaches or gastrointes- tinal dysfunction are occasionally attributed to the ongoing sleep difficulties as well. </br>The fatigue of insomnia sufferers is manifest mainly as a lack of energy and desire to reduce or limit activity levels.</br>This symptom should be differentiated from reports of subjective sleepiness as well as from unintended sleep episodes.</br>Insomnia sufferers commonly report subjective sleepiness characterized by a sense of reduced alertness and enhanced need or desire to sleep.</br>However, they seldom fall asleep spontaneously without intending to do so.</br>Despite a desire to nap, many individuals with insomnia are unable to do so.</br>Frequent, unintentional daytime sleep episodes are more characteristic of other types of sleep disorders such as sleep disordered breathing, narcolepsy, idio- pathic hypersomnia, and the like. </br>In young children, difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both are often the result of inappropriate sleep associations or inadequate limit setting.</br>Inappropriate sleep associ-</br>ations result from a child’s dependency on specific stimulation, objects, or settings for initiating sleep or returning to sleep following an awakening; in the absence of these conditions, sleep onset is significantly delayed.</br>This manifestation usually presents as frequent nighttime awakenings and/or nighttime fears or anxiety about sleeping alone.</br>The process of falling asleep is associated with a specific form of stimulation (e.g., rocking, watching television), object (e.g., bottle, excessive feedings), or setting (e.g., lighted room, parents remaining in the room, or child taken to parents’ bed).</br>When such conditions are absent, children with this disorder experience difficulty falling asleep at bedtime and following normal nighttime arousals.</br>If the conditions associ- ated with falling asleep are reestablished, the child usually resumes sleep relatively quickly.</br>Because sleep-onset associations are highly prevalent in young children, the phenomenon is defined as a disorder only if (1) the associations are highly problem- atic or demanding (e.g., extended rocking, car rides); (2) sleep onset is significantly delayed or sleep is otherwise disrupted in the absence of the associated conditions; and (3) caregiver intervention is frequently required to aid the onset or resumption of sleep.</br>Limit-setting issues are characterized by bedtime stalling or bedtime refusal that is met with and reinforced by inadequate limit setting by a caregiver.</br>Sleep problems occur when caregivers institute no or few limits or when limits are instituted inconsistently or in an unpredictable manner.</br>Limit-setting sleep problems may also result in prolonged nocturnal awakenings, depending on caregiver response during the night. </br>It also should be noted that some children’s needs for specific conditions for sleeping or their resistance to go to bed may reflect underlying anxiety or fears.</br>Fear of sleep- ing alone, being in the dark, or having nightmares may lead some children to demand certain sleep promoting conditions (presence of parent in bedroom) or to repeatedly delay their bedtimes. </br>Although transient and episodic forms of insomnia occur, the clinically significant daytime consequences of insomnia and the longer term, more serious morbidity out- comes most typically develop when the sleep difficulties occur at least three times per week and persist for at least three months.</br>For this reason, these frequency and dura- tion criteria must be met for the assignment of a chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis.</br>However, it is recognized that more acute and episodic forms of insomnia may cause significant distress and functional impairment and require clinical attention.</br>Cases that meet all criteria except the frequency or duration criteria for chronic insomnia disorder should be assigned a diagnosis of short-term insomnia disorder. </br>Associated Features Individuals with chronic insomnia disorder typically note feelings of reduced well-being and general malaise during the day.</br>In addition, excessive focus on and worry about ongoing sleep difficulties and their associated daytime consequences are common.</br>Thoughts about ongoing sleep difficulties may occur through the day and may be amplified as bedtime Insomnia Insomnia approaches.</br>Frank performance anxiety about sleep is common.</br>Although many with insomnia may appear anxious and worry-prone, their anxiety and worry are often focused mainly on their sleep difficulties.</br>When anxiety and worry are more pervasive and not solely focused on sleep problems, a comorbid anxiety disorder may be present.</br>Many with chronic insomnia disorder show a pattern of conditioned arousal in response to envi- ronmental cues in their bedrooms or conscious efforts to initiate sleep.</br>Such individuals may fall asleep easily in settings outside of their bedrooms when not trying to sleep, but show a pattern of cognitive and physiological arousal when lying down in their beds with the intention to fall asleep.</br>Some patients with this pattern may report sleeping better when away from home than when at home.</br>Unlike noncomplaining normal sleepers, indi- viduals with chronic insomnia disorder often express conscious intentions and excessive effort to sleep, only to find sleep difficult to initiate under such circumstances. </br>In children, the sleep disturbance may be accompanied by daytime behavioral prob- lems and limit-setting difficulties during the day.</br>In addition, the nighttime sleep distur- bance often results in poor parental sleep and associated daytime impairment.</br>Marital conflicts regarding how to respond to or intervene with the ongoing sleep problem may arise.</br>Parents also may develop negative feelings toward the child who disrupts their sleep and demands their attention during the night. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Various clinical and pathophysiological subtypes of insomnia have been described in previous nosologies.</br>Both the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition describe independently occurring or primary forms of insomnia.</br>Within DSM-IV-TR, the global term, primary insomnia, is applied to all forms of insomnia that are not better explained by a coincident psychi- atric, medical or substance</br>use/abuse disorder.</br>Within the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition system, multiple primary insomnia subtypes are delin- eated.</br>The specific primary insomnia subtypes listed in the previous International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition include the following: Psychophysiological insomnia is characterized primarily by heightened arousal and learned sleep-preventing associations that result in a complaint of insomnia.</br>Patients presumed to have this type of insomnia often have sleep difficulty when trying to sleep in their usual sleep setting at home but may fall asleep easily in a novel sleep setting or when not trying to sleep.</br>They also demonstrate excessive focus on and worry about sleep and suffer from elevated levels of cognitive and somatic arousal, particularly at bedtime. </br>26 Idiopathic insomnia is characterized by a longstanding complaint of sleep difficulties with insidious onset occurring during infancy or early childhood.</br>It is presumed to arise in infancy or early childhood without discernible cause and to persist over time without sustained periods of remission.</br>Given its early onset, stability over time, and lifelong course, this disorder is thought to arise from either genetically determined or congenital aberrations in the sleep-inducing or arousal systems in the brain, or both.</br>No consistent genetic markers or neural pathology have been identified among those presumed to suffer from this condition. </br>Paradoxical insomnia, which has previously been called sleep state misperception, is described as a complaint of severe sleep disturbance without corroborative objective evidence of the degree of sleep disturbance claimed.</br>Those presumed to have this form of sleep difficulty have a marked propensity to underestimate the amount of sleep they actually are obtaining.</br>In essence, they are thought to perceive much of the time they actually sleep as wakefulness.</br>Although many such patients routinely obtain norma- tive amounts of sleep, as documented by standard polysomnographic measures, they complain of the common sleep/wake symptoms of other insomnia disorders.</br>Some studies using neuroimaging or sleep electroencephalograph (EEG) spectral analysis techniques have suggested that an altered sleep/wake arousal system in such individ- uals may explain the apparent mismatch between their conventional objective sleep measures and subjective sleep reports. </br>Inadequate sleep hygiene is presumed to result from or be sustained by daily living activities that are inconsistent with the maintenance of good-quality sleep and normal daytime alertness.</br>Patients with this form of insomnia have ongoing sleep/ wake difficulties as a function of practices such as daytime napping, maintaining a highly variable sleep/wake schedule, routinely using sleep-disruptive products (caf- feine, tobacco, alcohol) too close to bedtime, engaging in mentally or physically acti- vating or emotionally upsetting activities too close to bedtime, routinely using the bed and bedroom for activities other than sleep, or failing to maintain a comfortable environment for sleep. </br>Behavioral insomnia of childhood is presumed to result from improper sleep train- ing or limit setting by parents or caretakers.</br>Within this broader diagnosis, several subtypes have been described.</br>Sleep-onset association type is characterized by the child’s dependency on specific stimulation, objects, or settings for initiating sleep or returning to sleep following an awakening; in the absence of these conditions, sleep onset is significantly delayed.</br>Limit-setting type is characterized by bedtime stalling or bedtime refusal that is the result of inadequate limit setting by a caregiver.</br>A mixed type Insomnia Insomnia characterized by features of sleep-onset association difficulties and bedtime resistance represents a third subtype within this diagnostic category. </br>The DSM-IV-TR and International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition also describe several so-called secondary insomnias, arising from co-occurring primary or causative conditions.</br>Among these are the following: Insomnia due to (another) mental disorder is thought to be caused by or secondary to a co-occurring psychiatric condition.</br>Insomnia is a common complaint, particularly among patients with mood disorders and anxiety disorders.</br>Likewise, sleep distur- bance is commonly seen in those with psychotic spectrum disorders and various Axis II (personality) disorders.</br>Among those individuals presumed to have insomnia due to a mental disorder, insomnia has historically been regarded as a secondary symptom, caused by the mental disorder itself. </br>Insomnia due to (a) medical condition is thought to be caused by or secondary to a co-occurring medical condition.</br>Like the mental disorders, many medical condi- tions may have an ongoing insomnia complaint associated with them.</br>In particular, those conditions that cause some form of ongoing pain or discomfort, mobility lim- itation, or breathing disturbance commonly have insomnia complaints accompanying them.</br>Among those individuals presumed to have insomnia due to a medical disor- der, insomnia has historically been regarded as a secondary symptom, caused by the medical disorder itself. </br>Insomnia due to drug or substance is thought to be caused by or secondary to use of or withdrawal from a drug or substance.</br>Many forms of prescription and nonprescrip- tion medications, street drugs, and other commonly used substances may produce sleep disturbances either during periods of use or upon withdrawal.</br>Given these effects, insomnia complaints may arise either during periods when these substances are used or following their discontinuance.</br>Among those individuals presumed to have insom- nia due to drug or substance, insomnia has historically been regarded as a secondary symptom, caused by the drug or substance itself. </br>Despite the heuristic appeal of these various subtypes, it is often difficult to discrim- inate among them in clinical practice.</br>Many of the defining features of the so-called primary insomnia subtypes such as conditioned arousal, poor sleep hygiene prac- tices, and underestimation of sleep time are ubiquitous among insomnia sufferers, per se, and are not specific to one subgroup.</br>This is true whether the so-called primary insomnia subtypes are considered in isolation or if all of the primary and secondary subtypes mentioned are considered.</br>There is substantial symptom overlap both within the group of primary insomnias as well as among the primary and secondary insomnias.</br>Furthermore, many individuals with insomnia have mul- tiple medical and psychiatric comorbidities, making it difficult to assign causation to any single factor.</br>As a result, discrimination among these subtypes has proven difficult given their current definitions and available methods for their ascertain- ment.</br>Furthermore, it is not clear that insomnia is always the result of co-occur- ring medical, mental, or substance use disorders.</br>Often insomnia may precede the onset of such conditions, and even when precipitated by such conditions, the insom- nia may evolve and develop partial or total independence over time.</br>In such cir- cumstances, the term secondary insomnia seems inappropriate.</br>Currently there is limited understanding of mechanistic pathways in chronic insomnia, so it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the association or direction of causality between insomnia and such co-occurring conditions.</br>Furthermore, other than the differing treatments required for distinctive comorbidities, efficacious treatments for insomnia generally are similar across the range of insomnia subtypes.</br>Finally, research has provided very limited support for the reliability and validity of the various specific subtypes discussed. </br>International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition additionally delineates the separate pediatric diagnosis, behavioral insomnia of childhood, characterized by sleep difficulties resulting from inappropriate sleep associations or inadequate limit setting by parents or caretakers.</br>Although perhaps more common in young children, inappropriate sleep associations can occur in older age groups.</br>For example, adults with insomnia may report intolerance for quiet and dark settings and may not be able to fall asleep unless the television is on.</br>Similarly, it is not clear that limit-setting issues are involved in the sleep difficulties of only young children.</br>Such difficulties also can manifest during adolescence as a function of volitionally delaying bedtimes.</br>Similarly, they may occur in older, cognitively impaired adults when their caretak- ers allow liberal daytime napping that in turn results in disruptive awakenings and night wandering.</br>It is also clear that many of the features of sleep/wake dysfunc- tion assigned to this childhood insomnia subtype overlap substantially with the global insomnia disorder.</br>Given these considerations, a separate childhood insomnia diagno- sis is of questionable merit. </br>In addition to these various subtypes, a distinctive subtype of insomnia with objectively short sleep duration has been recently described.</br>This group is characterized by insom- nia complaints, along with an objectively documented average sleep time less than six hours per night and elevated morbidity risk.</br>Because evidence in support of this Insomnia Insomnia insomnia is currently limited, it is premature to delineate a separate insomnia category for this presentation at this juncture. </br>Given all of these considerations, a more global and defensible approach has been chosen for the diagnosis of those with chronic insomnia complaints.</br>Specifically, the single diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder is provided for all patients who have per- sistent and frequent insomnia complaints whether they occur in the presence or absence of a potentially sleep-disruptive comorbid psychiatric illness, medical disorder, or pattern of substance use. </br>Demographics The full clinical syndrome of chronic insomnia disorder occurs in about 10% of the population, but the prevalence of transient insomnia symptoms is much higher (30% to 35% of the population).</br>Chronic insomnia disorder is more common in women, those with medical/psychiatric/substance disorders, and in people in lower socioeco- nomic strata.</br>It may occur at any age but is more commonly diagnosed in older adults, most likely due to age-related deterioration in sleep continuity and increase in medical comorbidities and medication use that increase insomnia risk. </br>Insomnia associated with requirements of parental/caregiver presence at bedtime and/or during the night, along with insomnia due to limit-setting difficulties, are estimated to occur in 10% to 30% of children, depending on the exact definitions used.</br>Certain subgroups of children, such as those suffering from chronic illnesses or neurodevelopmental disorders, have a somewhat higher prevalence of insomnia symptoms.</br>Because children are not expected to sleep through the night with reg- ularity until they are three to six months of age, six months is a reasonable age to first consider a diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder, unless the sleeplessness is very marked at an earlier age.</br>Furthermore, sleep-onset associations and limit-set- ting problems are strongly associated with caregivers’ behaviors, bedtime interac- tions, and culture.</br>Thus, the interpretation of the nighttime awakenings and demands for parental contact should be considered in the context of the family and culture.</br>Identification of sleep problems in children and adolescents are often based on spe- cific cultural definitions.</br>Studies on adolescents indicate prevalence rates of 3% to 12%, depending on the diagnostic criteria utilized, with higher frequency in girls than boys after puberty. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Individuals who have difficulty sleeping during stressful times or who report being habitual light sleepers appear to have elevated propensity to develop chronic insomnia. </br>30 Prior transient episodes of poor sleep elevate the risk for subsequent development of a chronic insomnia disorder.</br>Job-related stress and factors such as death of a loved one, divorce, a marked change in work schedule, job loss, and other major life changes are often precipitating circumstances for chronic insomnia disorder.</br>Personality factors that produce anxious overconcern about health, general well-being, or daytime func- tioning may serve as predisposing characteristics because individuals with chronic insomnia disorder often display excessive preoccupation with daytime consequences of insomnia, and they devote particular effort to what they presume are sleep-promot- ing practices.</br>A psychological style characterized by the repression and internalization of disturbing affect is characteristic of those with chronic insomnia disorder and also may represent a predisposing trait.</br>Parents who have unrealistic sleep expectations for their children may predispose them to insomnia by putting them in bed too early or assigning them too much time in bed each night. </br>Comorbid psychiatric conditions, particularly mood and anxiety disorders, are asso- ciated with increased risk for chronic insomnia disorder.</br>Likewise, comorbid restless legs syndrome or medical disorders such as GERD or those conditions that result in chronic pain, breathing difficulties, or immobility also are associated with increased risk for chronic insomnia disorder.</br>A pattern of alcohol dependence/abuse as well as the excessive use of

 may raise risk for chronic insomnia disorder.</br>Insomnia in children is often associated with difficult temperament, as well as other comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions.</br>Unstable home situations, safety concerns and domestic abuse are likewise significant risk factors in both children and adults.</br>Caregiver and relationship factors are also important to consider.</br>Furthermore, parents of children with a current or past history of medical problems may have dif- ficulty setting limits, whether because of guilt, a sense that the child is “vulnerable,” or concerns about doing psychological harm.</br>Environmental factors such as the child sharing a room with a parent or with other siblings, the presence of extended family or others in the home, and cramped living accommodations may contribute to negative sleep-onset associations or poor limit setting. </br>Familial Patterns The familial pattern of insomnia is not well documented.</br>Nonetheless, the preva- lence of insomnia is higher among monozygotic twins relative to dizygotic twins; it is also higher in first-degree relatives than in the general population.</br>The association is stronger with mothers and daughters.</br>The extent to which familial aggregation represents shared genetic predisposition, shared environment, learned behavior (e.g., by observations of parental behavior), or a by-product of psychopathology remains undetermined. </br>31 Insomnia Insomnia Onset, Course, and Complications Onset may be insidious or acute.</br>In the former case, individuals often report symptoms of insomnia in early life or young adulthood.</br>Onset of insomnia is often associated with major life events (e.g., separation, death of a loved one), minor daily stressors, or changes in sleep schedule. </br>The course of insomnia can be situational, recurrent, or persistent.</br>The specific type of sleep complaint may also change over time.</br>Individuals who complain of diffi- culty falling asleep at one time may later complain of difficulty maintaining sleep, and vice versa.</br>Although short-term insomnia often remits when the precipitating event subsides or the individual adapts to it, sleep difficulties may also persist over time even after the initial triggering factor has disappeared.</br>When left untreated, insomnia may persist and gradually lead to a vicious cycle of poor sleep, daytime impairments, apprehension of insomnia, and further sleep disturbances.</br>Among predisposed individ- uals, insomnia can also follow an intermittent course, with recurrent episodes of sleep difficulties associated with stressful life events.</br>Even in persistent insomnia, there is extensive night-to-night variability, with an occasional good night’s sleep intertwined with several poor night’s sleep.</br>Approximately 70% of individuals with insomnia at a given time continue reporting insomnia a year later, and 50% still have insomnia three years later.</br>Complications of persistent insomnia include increased risks for depression, hypertension, work disability, and prolonged use of prescription or over- the-counter sleep aids. </br>Among children, chronic insomnia disorder may have its onset at any time during late infancy through the childhood years.</br>The course of chronic insomnia disorder in young children varies and depends on the reasons for the sleeplessness.</br>When limit-setting factors and negative sleep associations resolve, sleep often improves.</br>With age, inde- pendence and privacy become more important, and sleep difficulties may decrease.</br>Complications may result from the consequent sleep loss and include irritability and decreased attention and school performance.</br>Increased family tensions and caregiver sleep loss may also result.</br>Some who develop insomnia during childhood may con- tinue to suffer from chronic insomnia disorder into adulthood. </br>Developmental Issues Developmental issues during childhood, such as separation anxiety and age/develop- mental milestones, may predispose a child to developing sleep problems.</br>For example, limit-setting issues are often more common after the child is old enough to climb out of the crib or is moved into a bed, has increased verbal skills, and desires greater indepen- dence.</br>Because children are not expected to sleep through the night with regularity until they are three to six months of age, six months is a reasonable age to first consider a diagnosis of insomnia disorder, unless the sleeplessness is very marked at an earlier age.</br>However, when sleep difficulties are persistent and pronounced in infants, underlying medical causes should be considered (e.g., sleep disordered breathing, GERD, pain). </br>The specific symptoms of chronic insomnia disorder, as well as precipitating and per- petuating factors, may vary across the adult age range.</br>These changes may in part reflect developmental changes across adulthood, such as the phase delay of endoge- nous circadian rhythms in adolescence and young adulthood, and the phase advance and increased number of awakenings often seen even among healthy older adults.</br>Epidemiological studies confirm that sleep onset difficulties and nonrestorative sleep are most common among young adults with chronic insomnia disorder, whereas sleep maintenance insomnia and early morning awakening are more common in middle-aged and older adults.</br>Objective daytime sleepiness is uncommon in younger adults with insomnia, but more common in older adults.</br>However, older adults may have less sleep dissatisfaction than their younger counterparts, despite objectively worse sleep continuity.</br>Precipitating factors for chronic insomnia disorder may also change across the adult age range, with medical and medication factors assuming a larger role in older adults.</br>Likewise, perpetuating factors may vary with the life circumstances of adults of different ages.</br>One common example is the option of older adults to spend large amounts of time in bed after retirement, which may exacerbate the effects of age on sleep continuity.</br>Finally, medical disorders and symptoms (e.g., pain, dyspnea, and impaired mobility) and medications often play a larger role in the insomnia of older adults in comparison with younger adults.</br>

 ately prescribed to older adults, often with limited benefit and the potential for rebound and withdrawal insomnia. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Studies of the pathophysiology of chronic insomnia disorder have focused on one or more dimensions of physiological hyperarousal during sleep and wakefulness.</br>These studies contrast groups of insomnia sufferers, typically those without sig- nificant comorbidities, with healthy controls using a variety of physiological mea- sures.</br>Many of these studies are characterized by small sample sizes and lack of replication.</br>Collectively these studies suggest increased physiological arousal among individuals with insomnia, characterized by measures such as increased heart rate, altered heart rate variability, increased whole-body metabolic rate, elevated corti- sol,

, and CRF levels (particularly near sleep onset), increased body temperature and increased high-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.</br>These studies imply Insomnia Insomnia heightened activity of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pitu- itary-adrenal axis across sleep and wakefulness that is thought to perpetuate sleep/ wake dysfunction.</br>Some evidence also suggests that physiological dysregulation may be more evident in certain subgroups of individuals with insomnia (e.g., those with extreme subjective-objective sleep discrepancies or those with insomnia and short objective sleep duration).</br>There is also some evidence that these findings may not generalize to insomnia comorbid with mental disorders, which may have differ- ent pathophysiological findings. </br>No discrete structural brain pathology can be identified in most individuals with insom- nia.</br>Patients with insomnia comorbid with neurological disorders such as stroke, brain trauma, and multiple sclerosis may have identifiable brain lesions, but insomnia is rarely their sole neurological symptom.</br>Recent studies have provided conflicting evi- dence regarding the finding of reduced hippocampal or anterior cingulate volume, with most studies reporting negative findings. </br>Objective Findings Although polysomnography is not indicated in the routine evaluation of insomnia, it may be useful to rule out other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing) among some patients who appear to meet criteria for chronic insomnia disorder.</br>In the absence of other sleep disorders, results of polysomnographic sleep monitoring of patients with chronic insomnia disorder may show increased sleep latency and/or increased wake time after sleep onset coupled with reduced sleep efficiency in com- parison with age-appropriate norms.</br>Sleep onset latency or wake time after sleep onset often exceeds 30 minutes, although one-hour to two-hour periods of wakefulness in bed are not uncommon.</br>A subset of patients shows reduced sleep duration of less than six hours per night.</br>Some patients show altered sleep architecture with an increase in stage N1 sleep and a decrease in slow wave sleep.</br>Patients with a pronounced condi- tioned sleep difficulty in the home environment may show a reverse first-night effect in the sleep laboratory (i.e., better sleep on the first vs. the second recording night).</br>However, some patients show normal sleep times and an absence of sleep onset or sleep maintenance difficulties on standard polysomnographic (PSG) measures.</br>Some insomnia patients have alterations in power density measures of the sleep EEG when compared with individuals without sleep complaints.</br>Specifically, these patients often show relatively greater power in the high frequency (beta and gamma ranges) band- widths.</br>Some reports have shown that elevated high-frequency power is characteris- tic of insomnia patients with marked subjective-objective discrepancies in sleep mea- sures, compared to insomnia patients with more obvious objective sleep disturbances or individuals without sleep complaints. </br>34 Serial monitoring with PSG or actigraphy typically shows marked night-to-night vari- ability in all sleep measures as well as in recorded bed and rising times.</br>This variability is typically greater than that of comparison groups of good sleepers. </br>Many patients with insomnia underestimate the actual sleep time shown by polysom- nography, and some may provide sleep estimates that fall far short of actual PSG- recorded sleep time.</br>This latter group has previously been categorized as having subjective insomnia, sleep state misperception, or paradoxical insomnia.</br>In general, patients with insomnia tend to underestimate sleep duration and overestimate sleep latency and awakenings, whereas good sleepers tend to overestimate sleep duration and underestimate sleep latency and awakenings relative to PSG.</br>This subjective-ob- jective mismatch may be related to physiological hyperarousal, and may be one of the core features of insomnia. </br>Results of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) usually show normal daytime alert- ness.</br>In several studies, patients with insomnia have longer mean MSLT values than control subjects, suggesting hyperalertness or hyperarousal.</br>A minority of insomnia patients, particularly older adults with insomnia, have reduced mean MSLT values indicating increased sleepiness.</br>Such a finding should prompt consideration of other concurrent sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea. </br>Young children typically show essentially normal sleep during PSG monitoring when the caregiver is present and appropriate limits are set in the laboratory. </br>Although PSG and MSLT testing usually are not helpful in the establishment of an insomnia disorder diagnosis, there are circumstances that may warrant such testing with selected patients.</br>PSG should be considered when there are reported symptoms or bed partner observations of sleep disordered breathing or periodic limb movements during sleep.</br>Patients who present insomnia symptoms accompanied by excessive daytime sleepiness may warrant PSG and MSLT testing, particularly if narcolepsy is suspected.</br>Patients who show acceptable adherence to trials of well-established insom- nia therapies but fail to show adequate treatment response may benefit by PSG to rule out a comorbid sleep disorder. </br>Finally, a small number of functional imaging studies have been conducted during sleep and wakefulness in insomnia and control groups.</br>These studies suggest region- ally specific increases of relative glucose metabolism in insomnia compared to controls.</br>Specifically, these studies show smaller wake to NREM decreases of relative glucose metabolism in sleep/wake-regulating regions including thalamus, upper brainstem, Insomnia Insomnia anterior cingulate, and limbic cortex in insomnia patients.</br>Self-reported and objective sleep disruptions are related to increased relative metabolism in these regions.</br>These findings are similar to regional activation patterns during sleep in an animal model of stress-induced insomnia.</br>Other studies using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have identified reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling in sleep-regu- lating regions in insomnia that correlate with objective measure of sleep continuity.</br>Studies examining task-related changes in blood flow using blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) paradigms have shown reduced activation relative to baseline levels in individuals with insomnia when compared to normal sleeping controls.</br>Task-related activation changes in the direction of “normalization” following cognitive behavioral treatment. </br>Differential Diagnosis A chronic insomnia disorder that presents as difficulty initiating sleep should be differen- tiated from delayed sleep-wake phase disorder.</br>In the latter condition, sleep initiation is consistently later than desired because the individual’s endogenous circadian rhythm is delayed relative to the desired sleep schedule.</br>Sleep-onset difficulties persist, and sleep time is reduced whenever the individual chooses bedtimes and rising times that are too early and out of phase with the endogenous circadian rhythm.</br>However, patients with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder are able to fall asleep with less difficulty, and sleep a normal amount of time, when sleeping in phase with their delayed endogenous rhythm by selecting late bed and rising times.</br>By comparison, those with a chronic insomnia disorder often feel sleepy at the desired bedtime but are unable to sleep regardless of the timing of their bed and rise times.</br>Furthermore, sleep problems tend to be more variable on a night-to-night basis in insomnia disorder.</br>Given the prevalence of delayed sleep- wake phase disorder in teenagers and young adults, it is particularly important to con- sider the possibility of this alternate or comorbid diagnosis when evaluating individuals from these age groups presenting with sleep onset insomnia complaints. </br>A chronic insomnia disorder that presents as a difficulty maintaining sleep with pre- mature morning rise times also should be differentiated from advanced sleep-wake phase disorder.</br>The latter tends to be more common in older adults than it is in younger adults and children.</br>Among those with an advanced sleep phase pattern, sleep initia- tion is consistently earlier than desired because the individual’s endogenous circadian rhythm is advanced relative to the desired sleep schedule.</br>However, total sleep time is adequate when the individual chooses early bed and rise times that coincide with the advanced endogenous circadian rhythm.</br>In contrast, those with chronic insomnia dis- order may display sleep maintenance difficulties and early morning rise time regard- less of the sleep schedule they select. </br>36 There can be some overlap between chronic insomnia disorder and both delayed and advanced sleep-wake phase disorders.</br>Patients with a delayed sleep pattern may become chronically frustrated or anxious about their inability to initiate sleep at their desired times, and this frustration or anxiety may continue to disrupt sleep and delay sleep onset well beyond the sleep onset time promoted by the endogenous rhythm.</br>Early morning awakenings may similarly have arousing sleep disruptive effects in the setting of an advanced sleep phase.</br>In such circumstances both a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder diagnosis and a chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis may apply and should be assigned. </br>Chronic insomnia disorder should also be discriminated from situational sleep dif- ficulties arising from sleep-disruptive environmental circumstances.</br>A variety of environmental factors including excessive noise or light and extreme temperatures will disrupt the sleep of most individuals.</br>Also, sleeping in an area where there is imminent threat or danger to one’s safety can also be disruptive to sleep.</br>Bed part- ners who snore loudly, move excessively during sleep, or have parasomnias may also disrupt one’s sleep.</br>When an individual reports environmental circumstances that would be regarded as disruptive to the sleep of most individuals, a chronic insomnia disorder should not be assigned.</br>Chronic insomnia disorder applies only when the individual reports sleep difficulty in the context of sleep-conducive envi- ronment circumstances or when the insomnia symptoms show some independence from the environmental factors.</br>When environmental circumstances are a primary cause of sleep disturbance and associated consequences, a diagnosis of other sleep disorder may be considered. </br>Chronic insomnia disorder should also be differentiated from patterns of chronic voli- tional sleep restriction (insufficient sleep syndrome).</br>Some individuals show excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and reduced sleep at night as a result of electing overly demanding daytime schedules or by volitionally delaying sleep in order to engage in desired recreational or social activities.</br>However, when allowing themselves suffi- cient time to sleep, they are able to initiate and maintain sleep easily and for a normal duration.</br>Those with chronic insomnia disorder tend to have excessive wake time and reduced sleep time despite routinely allotting sufficient time to sleep.</br>Moreover, chronic insomnia disorder is not typically associated with excessive daytime sleepi- ness and unintentional daytime sleep episodes, which are often observed in those with patterns of volitional sleep restriction. </br>Insomnia symptoms may occur comorbid with another sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome.</br>A chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis would apply Insomnia Insomnia only when: (1) the insomnia symptoms show some independence in their onset or variation over time from the other symptoms of the co-occurring sleep disorder; or (2) when insomnia symptoms persist despite adequate treatment reflected by marked symptom improvement in the coincident sleep disorder.</br>A chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis would not apply when effective treatment of the coincident sleep disorder resolves the insomnia symptoms. </br>Among children, sleep difficulties may be present when the child has to sleep alone in a separate room, but absent when the child is allowed to sleep with parents or when a parent is present in the child’s bedroom.</br>An absence of sleep difficulties under the latter circumstances does not indicate the insomnia is resolved.</br>Only when the child is able to sleep consistently independently is there no longer an insomnia problem.</br>In some children, the persistence of sleep difficulties in the absence of parents may reflect underlying conditions such as separation anxiety or an anxiety disorder. </br>In young children, sleep difficulties can be the result of medical issues, including gas- troesophageal reflux, as well as developmental milestones, such as motoric, language, and cognitive development.</br>Children, adolescents, and adults may develop a chronic insomnia disorder comorbid with a medical or psychiatric disorder.</br>Insomnia symp- toms may arise as a result of either another sleep disorder, a medical condition, or a psychiatric disorder that has sleep-disruptive effects.</br>A chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis would apply when: (1) the insomnia symptoms show some independence in their onset or variation over time from the other symptoms of the co-occurring sleep, medical ,or psychiatric disorder; or (2) when insomnia symptoms persist despite ade- quate treatment reflected by marked symptom improvement in the coincident sleep, medical, or psychiatric disorder.</br>Because insomnia symptoms often develop some independence over time, a chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis usually will be war- ranted when those symptoms are persistent in association with a chronic medical or psychiatric disorder.</br>A chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis would not apply when effective treatment of the coincident sleep, medical, or psychiatric disorder resolves the insomnia symptoms. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Much remains to be learned about the underlying pathophysiological pathways leading to insomnia and whether insomnia should be classified as a unitary disorder or sub- divided into several subtypes.</br>Clearly, these issues are closely linked.</br>Further studies that clarify the pathophysiological pathways leading to insomnia ultimately will reveal whether those meeting current criteria for chronic insomnia disorder suffer from a single disease or multiple separate diseases with similar outward presentations. </br>38 A related unresolved issue is whether the current global classification promotes a

 approach to insomnia therapy that ultimately fails to benefit some insomnia subgroups.</br>Perhaps this global classification scheme will overlook distinctive insomnia subtypes with specific treatment needs that vary from the

 treatments typically provided. </br>Previous editions of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders allowed for the assignment of an insomnia diagnosis to patients who present exclusively with com- plaints of nonrestorative sleep; that is, patients who complain only of sleep that is poor in quality or unrefreshing, in the absence of sleep-onset or sleep maintenance complaints, could qualify for an insomnia diagnosis in previous versions of this nosol- ogy.</br>The current version of this nosology excludes such patients from the insomnia diagnostic categories.</br>This decision was based on several considerations.</br>Most insom- nia patients present with complaints of sleep initiation or maintenance difficulties.</br>Although a small subset of patients present with isolated complaints of nonrestorative sleep, this complaint more commonly arises in association with other symptoms of insomnia, or in conjunction with sleep disordered breathing, other sleep disorders or certain chronic medical conditions (e.g., fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome).</br>Although various epidemiological studies have identified subgroups who are presumed to have an insomnia disorder and present solely with a complaint that their sleep is non- restorative or unrefreshing, such studies typically lack polysomnography that would be needed to rule out other occult sleep disorders as a cause.</br>Finally, nonrestorative sleep remains a poorly defined construct that may reflect not only a type of sleep disturbance, but also the daytime consequences of poor sleep such as fatigue and anergia.</br>This con- struct would benefit from further definitional efforts and research to explore its clinical significance in the context of insomnia.</br>Given these considerations, the isolated com- plaint of nonrestorative sleep was not retained as part of the diagnostic definition of the insomnia disorders delineated in this manual. </br>Bibliography Baglioni C, Battagliese G, Feige B, et al.</br>Insomnia as a predictor of depression: a meta-analytic evaluation of longitudinal epidemiological studies.</br>J Affect Dis 2011;135;10–9. </br>Bastien CH, St-Jean G,

The patient reports, or the patient’s parent or caregiver observes, one or more of the following:1 . Difficulty initiating sleep. </br>2. Difficulty maintaining sleep. </br>3. Waking up earlier than desired. </br>4.</br>Resistance to going to bed on appropriate schedule. </br>5.</br>Difficulty sleeping without parent or caregiver intervention. </br>B. The patient reports, or the patient’s parent or caregiver observes, one or more of the following related to the nighttime sleep difficulty: . Fatigue/malaise. </br>2. Attention, concentration, or memory impairment. </br>3. Impaired social, family, vocational, or academic performance. </br>4. Mood disturbance/irritability. </br>5. Daytime sleepiness. </br>6.</br>Behavioral problems (e.g., hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression).</br>7. Reduced motivation/energy/initiative. </br>8.</br>Proneness for errors/accidents. </br>9.</br>Concerns about or dissatisfaction with sleep. </br>41 Insomnia C. The reported sleep/wake complaints cannot be explained purely by inadequate opportunity (i.e., enough time is allotted for sleep) or inadequate circumstances (i.e., the environment is safe, dark, quiet, and comfortable) for sleep. </br>D. The sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms have been present for less than three months. </br>E. The sleep/wake difficulty is not better explained by another sleep disorder. </br>Notes .</br>Reports of difficulties initiating sleep, difficulties maintaining sleep, or waking up too early can be seen in all age groups.</br>Resistance going to bed on an appropriate schedule and difficulty sleeping without parent or caregiver intervention is seen most commonly in children and older adults who require the supervision of a caretaker due to a significant level of functional impairment (e.g., those with dementia). </br>2. Patients with short-term insomnia disorder may complain of sleep/ wake difficulties fewer than three times per week on average, yet have clinically significant concerns about their symptoms and warrant clinical attention. </br>3.</br>Many conditions such as grief, acute pain, or other acute stressors are quite often associated with poor sleep.</br>When such conditions are the sole cause of the sleep difficulty, a separate insomnia diagnosis may not apply.</br>The primary factor in determining application of a short- term or adjustment insomnia diagnosis is the extent to which the sleep disturbance becomes a significant focus for the individual and/or warrants independent clinical attention. </br>Essential Features The essential feature of short-term insomnia disorder is a short-term difficulty ini- tiating or maintaining sleep that results in general sleep dissatisfaction.</br>The sleep complaint is accompanied by daytime distress about poor sleep or impairment in family, social, occupational, academic, or other important areas of functioning.</br>Furthermore, the sleep disturbance and associated daytime symptoms occur despite having adequate time and circumstances each night to obtain necessary sleep.</br>Short- term insomnia disorder can occur in isolation or comorbid with a mental disorder, medical condition, or substance use.</br>In many cases of short-term insomnia lasting less than three months, there is an identifiable cause that serves as the precipitant.</br>In other cases, insomnia occurs episodically, often coincident to daytime stressors that account for the insomnia. </br>42 As is the case for chronic insomnia disorder, sleep complaints that compose short- term insomnia disorder may include difficulties initiating sleep or difficulties main- taining sleep.</br>The latter complaint may include waking up during the night with difficulty returning to sleep or having a final awakening occurring too early, well before the desired rising time.</br>Short-term insomnia disorder may be character- ized solely by sleep onset or sleep maintenance complaints or, more commonly, by both types of complaints occurring together.</br>Individuals’ sleep complaints may vary such that sleep onset difficulties are apparent on some nights, whereas sleep maintenance difficulties are present on other nights.</br>Complaints about poor-quality, unrefreshing, or nonrestorative sleep may accompany sleep onset and sleep mainte- nance complaints, but do not meet the definition of this condition when they occur in isolation. </br>Associated Features Sleep disturbance is the primary feature of short-term insomnia disorder, but it is com- monly accompanied by waking symptoms similar to those seen in chronic insomnia disorder.</br>Specific symptoms such as fatigue, impaired attention and concentration, poor memory, irritability, and distress about poor sleep are common.</br>When the insomnia arises in reaction to a stressful life event, such as the loss of a loved one, major illness, or divorce, the associated features may include anxiety, worry, ruminative thoughts, sadness, or depression in relation to the specific stressor.</br>If the individual uses alcohol, illicit drugs, or medications for self-treatment, additional symptoms related to these substances may be seen. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes None. Demographics Short-term insomnia disorder can occur at any age.</br>However, a short-term form of insomnia may be difficult to establish in infants because it is often difficult to link stressors to sleep disturbances in this age group.</br>The exact prevalence of short-term insomnia disorder is unknown.</br>The one-year prevalence of short-term insomnia dis- order among adults appears to be in the range of 15% to 20%.</br>Like chronic insomnia disorder, short-term insomnia disorder is more prevalent in women than in men, and in older age groups. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Affected individuals may note a lifelong tendency toward light sleep or diffi- culty sleeping during times of stress.</br>A previous history of anxiety or depressive Insomnia Insomnia symptoms and disorders also may predispose an individual to develop a short- term insomnia disorder.</br>In children, having a parent with insomnia or living in a household lacking parental reinforcement of a consistent sleep/wake schedule may be predisposing factors. </br>An acute, identifiable event or stressor usually precipitates this form of insomnia.</br>Common precipitating events include changes or disputes in interpersonal relation- ships, occupational stress, personal losses, bereavement, diagnosis or onset of a new medical condition, visiting or moving to a new location, or physical changes to the usual sleep environment or schedule.</br>Changes or stresses with a positive emotional tone also may serve as precipitating events.</br>In children or dependent adults, such insomnia can arise when the caretaker makes abrupt changes in the child’s or adult’s sleep routines or schedule.</br>As is the case for chronic insomnia disorder, environ- mental factors such as the child sharing a room with a parent or with other sib- lings, the presence of extended family or others in the home, and cramped living accommodations may contribute to negative sleep-onset associations or poor limit setting in children. </br>Familial Patterns Familial patterns are less well documented for cases of short-term insomnia disor- der than they are for individuals meeting criteria for chronic insomnia disorder.</br>Nonetheless, the familial aggregation found for chronic insomnia disorders is expected to also occur among individuals with more transient forms of insomnia.</br>Data support a greater genetic diathesis to psychophysiologic arousal among certain individuals in response to stressors.</br>This may, in turn, suggest a constitutional predisposition to short- term or adjustment insomnia in such individuals. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Many individuals who develop short-term insomnia disorder experience remission of their insomnia symptoms over time.</br>This occurs as distress over the precipitating event diminishes over time or in response to withdrawal of the stressor.</br>However, a portion of those who initially experience short-term insomnia may develop a more chronic form of insomnia and subsequently meet criteria for chronic insomnia dis- order.</br>These individuals will then have the course and complications described for chronic insomnia disorder. </br>Developmental Issues As is the case for chronic insomnia disorder, short-term insomnia disorder would not be considered until after a child reaches at least six months of age. </br>44 The propensity to experience sleep disturbance in response to stress may dispose young and older individuals toward acute forms of insomnia.</br>As is the case for chronic insomnia disorder, sleep onset difficulties are most common among young adults with short-term insomnia, whereas sleep maintenance complaints and early morning awakening are more common in middle-aged and older adults.</br>Objective daytime sleepiness is uncommon in younger adults with short-term insomnia disorder, but is more common in older adults.</br>Balancing job and family stressors may contribute to intermittent short-term insomnia problems in younger and middle-aged adults.</br>In contrast, older, retired adults may have short-term insomnia disorder related to exacerbations in comorbid chronic medical con- ditions or due to loss of loved ones that commonly occurs with advancing age. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Research on the pathology and pathophysiology of short-term variants of insomnia disorder is generally lacking because the majority of studies addressing this issue have focused on samples with chronic insomnia disorders. </br>Differential Diagnosis Short-term insomnia disorder shares many features with chronic insomnia disorder.</br>The primary difference between the two conditions is that short-term insomnia disor- der does not meet the duration and frequency criteria required for the chronic insomnia disorder diagnosis.</br>Short-term insomnia disorder also should be distinguished from circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders resulting from rotating shift work or jet lag.</br>In the latter case, the sleep disturbance arises from a sleep-wake schedule alteration that results in a mismatch between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep-wake schedule chosen—for example, having to sleep in the daytime rather than during the nighttime.</br>In the case of short-term insomnia disorder, no such mismatch exists; yet, the individual demonstrates sleep onset or maintenance difficulties nonetheless. </br>Bibliography Agnew HW Jr, Webb WB, Williams RL.</br>The first night effect: an EEG study of sleep.</br>Psychophysiology 1966;2:263–6.

 or other respiratory depressants on respiratory control centers. </br>Treatment-emergent central sleep apnea is a new addition to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders.</br>In this disorder, the patient exhibits predominantly obstructive events during diagnostic sleep testing (e.g., obstructive or mixed apneas and obstructive hypopneas), but central apneas or central hypopneas emerge or persist on positive airway pressure treatment without a backup rate and are the predominant residual breathing abnormality (i.e., obstructive events have resolved).</br>A diagnosis of treatment-emergent central sleep apnea is made when the central sleep apnea component is not better explained by another diagnosis (i.e., another central sleep apnea disorder). </br>Sleep related hypoventilation disorders are characterized by an abnormal increase in the arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) during sleep.</br>Adult and pediatric hypoventilation disorders are defined by different criteria.</br>For adults, an increase in the arterial PCO2 (or sur- rogate) to greater than 55 mm Hg for at least 10 minutes or an increase ≥ 10 mm</br>Hg above the awake value to a value of 50 mm Hg or greater for at least 10 minutes is required.</br>In pediatric patients, the PaCO2 (or surrogate) must be greater than 50 mm Hg for greater than 25% of total sleep time. </br>In this edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, there are a number of changes in the classification of sleep related hypoventilation disorders.</br>The obesity hypoventilation syndrome is listed as a separate disorder given that it is both prevalent and has distinct clinical characteristics.</br>In contrast to other sleep related hypoventila- tion disorders, a diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome requires documenta- tion of awake (daytime) hypoventilation (PaCO2 &gt; 45 mm Hg).</br>For the other disorders in this category, awake hypoventilation may or may not be present. </br>In the previous version of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, a group of disorders were listed under the category of sleep related hypoventilation/hypoxemia disorders.</br>In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, disorders manifesting hypoventilation are separated from disorders in which only a finding of hypoxemia (arterial oxygen desaturation) during sleep is documented.</br>Demonstrating sleep related hypoventilation rather than simply hypoxemia has important diagnostic and treatment consequences.</br>Sleep related hypoxemia disorders are characterized by sustained periods of significantly reduced oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep.</br>This diagnostic category is used when sleep related hypoventilation is either not present or the status is unknown.</br>Sleep related hypoxemia can occur due to hypoventilation, ven- tilation-perfusion mismatch, low partial pressure of oxygen, shunt, or a combination of Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders these factors.</br>Many diverse etiologies can be associated with sleep related hypoxemia.</br>There are no longer separate diagnostic categories for the various types of medical and neurological pathology that may contribute to hypoventilation or hypoxemia.</br>In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition, these included lower airway obstruction, pulmonary parenchymal and vascular pathology, and neuromus- cular and chest wall disorders.</br>In the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition, the specific pulmonary or neurological disorder should be diagnosed sep- arately, in association with a diagnosis of sleep related hypoventilation due medical or neurological condition or sleep related hypoxemia. </br>Bibliography Badr MS, Toiber F, Skatrud JB, Dempsey J.

Respiratory events defined according the most recent version of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. </br>3. RERAs and hypopnea events based on arousals from sleep cannot be scored using OCST because arousals by EEG criteria cannot be identified. </br>Essential Features OSA is characterized by repetitive episodes of complete (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) upper airway obstruction occurring during sleep.</br>These events often result in reduc- tions in blood oxygen saturation and are usually terminated by brief arousals from sleep.</br>By definition, apneic and hypopneic events last a minimum of 10 seconds.</br>Most events are 10 to 30 seconds in duration but occasionally persist for one minute or longer.</br>Events can occur in any stage of sleep but more frequently occur in stages N1, N2, and R sleep than in stage N3 sleep.</br>Events are usually longer and associated with more severe decreases in oxygen saturation when they occur in stage R sleep and when the individual is sleeping supine.</br>Oxygen saturation usually returns to baseline values following resumption of normal breathing but may remain low if the apneic or hypopneic events are very frequent and prolonged, or if there is underlying pulmonary pathology.</br>Snoring between apneas is typically reported by bed partners, as are wit- nessed episodes of gasping or choking and body movements that disrupt sleep.</br>Most patients awaken in the morning feeling tired and unrefreshed regardless of the duration of their time in bed.</br>Apneas, hypopneas, and snoring may be exacerbated following the ingestion of alcohol, use of sedating medications prior to sleep, or following an increase in body weight. </br>Excessive sleepiness is a major presenting complaint in many but not all cases.</br>The sleepiness is most evident during relaxing or inactive situations.</br>With extreme sleepi- ness, sleep may occur while actively conversing, eating, walking, or driving.</br>In women, excessive sleepiness is a less prominent complaint.</br>Additionally, reports of insomnia, poor sleep quality, and fatigue are common, particularly among women.</br>Quality of life generally is adversely affected by unrefreshing sleep, sleepiness, and fatigue.</br>Bed part- ners may also report sleep disruption and associated consequences.</br>The frequency of apneas and hypopneas during sleep correlates poorly with daytime symptom severity and impact on quality of life.</br>In some cases, affected individuals will not endorse any symptoms or confirm any bed partner observations. </br>Associated Features Systemic hypertension is a common finding in patients with OSA.</br>There is substan- tial clinical and epidemiologic evidence implicating OSA as a significant risk factor for development of systemic hypertension independent of other conditions such as obesity and smoking.</br>Additionally, OSA is frequently observed in patients with cor- onary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, and it may be an independent risk factor for these conditions.</br>OSA is also associated with type 2 diabetes, and there are accumulating data to suggest that it is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes.</br>Patients with severe disease may be at risk for developing pulmo- nary hypertension and cor pulmonale, although this is usually seen only in patients with daytime hypercapnia due to comorbid conditions such as morbid obesity or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</br>When OSA coexists with dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease, there may be worsening of the underly- ing heart disease and predisposition to congestive heart failure.</br>Gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, nocturia, mood disturbance, and erectile dysfunction are some- times reported in patients with OSA.</br>The disorder can also be associated with the following motor parasomnias: OSA-induced arousals from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep mimicking a primary disorder of arousal (confusional arousal, sleep- walking, or sleep terrors); OSA-induced arousals from REM sleep mimicking REM sleep behavior disorder; disorders of arousal from NREM associated with slow wave sleep rebound during initiation of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy of OSA; OSA-induced arousals linked with sleep related eating disorder; and OSA-induced nocturnal seizures or cerebral anoxic attacks with prominent motor activity. </br>Severity of OSA as determined by the frequency of apneas and hypopneas and/or degree of oxygen desaturation correlates poorly with symptomatic sleepiness.</br>Different measures of sleepiness, including self-reported severity of sleepiness, commonly used indices such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and objective measures such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), are not strongly correlated and, thus, assessment of sleepiness can be difficult and relatively unreliable.</br>In addition, patients may adapt to any level of sleepiness over time and fail to view it as a reportable problem.</br>Bed partner-observed breathing pauses and disruptive snoring may not always be accompa- nied by patient complaints of sleepiness.</br>Finally, it is important to note that sleepiness is a condition with a number of possible etiologies and a range of manifestations (see Differential Diagnosis). </br>55 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Apneas and hypopneas are believed to have similar pathophysiology and consequences.</br>Therefore, from a clinical perspective, there is little importance in distinguishing patients who have predominantly apnea from those who have predominantly hypopnea.</br>Occasionally, patients may demonstrate only REM-related apneas or hypopneas, but there is no consensus to suggest that this is a distinct clinical or pathophysiological subtype. </br>Some patients have relatively few arterial oxygen desaturations but a significant number of respiratory events characterized by narrowing of the upper airway result- ing in brief arousals from sleep.</br>Depending on the definition of hypopnea employed, these events typically meet criteria for either hypopneas associated with arousal but no desaturation, or for RERAs.</br>When initially described, this latter group was said to have UARS.</br>Current data suggest that this condition represents simply a variant of OSA in which obstructive events result in arousal but minimal arterial oxygen desaturation.</br>Patients with this condition commonly snore and report daytime sleepiness or fatigue.</br>However, there are some reports of patients with frequent respiratory arousals in the absence of snoring.</br>They tend to be less obese than individuals who have respiratory event-associated arterial oxygen saturation.</br>The prevalence of this group of patients is unknown.</br>When advanced technology is used to detect changes in airflow (as described in the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events), most of these patients will be diagnosed as having OSA, as defined by the criteria listed above. </br>COPD and OSA frequently coexist, but there is no common pathophysiologic rela- tionship.</br>Nevertheless, individuals with both disorders have greater nocturnal oxygen desaturation and daytime hypercapnia for the same degree of bronchial airflow obstruc- tion, and greater risk of developing pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.</br>The prevalence rate for having both conditions has been estimated to be 1%. </br>Demographics OSA can occur in any age group.</br>Estimates of prevalence are very dependent on how sleep related respiratory events are defined, as well as their frequency and other criteria used to define disease.</br>Nevertheless, general population-based studies from a number of countries indicate that OSA associated with daytime sleepiness occurs in 3% to 7% of adult men and 2% to 5% of adult women.</br>However, because many individuals with OSA do not endorse daytime sleepiness, the prevalence of the disease is likely much higher.</br>A major study yielded prevalence rates as high as 24% in men and 9% in women using only an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) criterion of ≥ 5/hour, although addition of a daytime sleepiness criterion reduced these estimates to 4% in males and 2% in females. </br>56 The prevalence of OSA increases with age, although it appears to plateau in the elderly.</br>The ratio of OSA in men compared to women is approximately two to one.</br>This dispar- ity may decline in middle to older age as a result of a greater risk for OSA in women after menopause. </br>OSA occurs in all racial and ethnic groups.</br>In younger and elderly groups, but not in middle-aged groups, OSA has been reported to be more prevalent in blacks than whites.</br>The prevalence of OSA in Asian patients is comparable to that of whites, despite having a generally lower body mass index (BMI).</br>Differences in craniofacial features that predispose Asians to developing OSA are the likely explanation.</br>Data comparing OSA prevalence rates among Hispanics and Native Americans to other racial/ethnic groups are sparse, although it is clear that OSA occurs commonly in these groups. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors The major predisposing factor for OSA is excess body weight.</br>It has been estimated that ~60% of moderate to severe OSA is attributable to obesity.</br>The risk of OSA increases as the degree of additional weight increases, with an extremely high preva- lence of OSA in people with morbid obesity.</br>OSA patients with normal or below-nor- mal body weight are more likely to have upper airway obstruction due to a localized structural abnormality such as a maxillomandibular malformation or adenotonsillar enlargement.</br>Increasing neck circumference predicts higher AHIs; it is not, however, independent of BMI.</br>Instability in ventilatory control appears to increase risk of OSA.</br>Those patients with an exaggerated ventilatory response to a respiratory disturbance have a greater propensity for obstructive events.</br>Menopause is a risk factor for this disorder in women, even after adjustment for age and BMI.</br>However, use of hormone replacement therapy may be protective.</br>There are conflicting data concerning smoking as a risk factor for OSA.</br>Various abnormalities of the bony and soft tissue structures of the head and neck may predispose the individual to having OSA.</br>These may be hereditary (e.g., mandibular size, mandibular position, palatal height) or acquired (e.g., enlarged adenoids and tonsils).</br>Endocrine disorders such as acromegaly and hypothy- roidism are risk factors for OSA.</br>Adults and children with Down syndrome also have a high prevalence of OSA.</br>OSA is common in patients with some neurologic disorders that affect peripheral muscles, such as myotonic dystrophy.</br>OSA is likely made worse following alcohol consumption or use of sedating medications before sleep and by nocturnal nasal restriction or congestion due to abnormal morphology, rhinitis, or both. </br>Familial Patterns OSA is a heritable condition as demonstrated by familial clustering of OSA patients.</br>First-degree relatives of OSA patients are twice as likely to have OSA in comparison Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders to those not affected.</br>Clustering of symptoms that are associated with OSA such as snoring, daytime sleepiness, and snorting or gasping also occurs.</br>Heritability explains approximately one third of the variation in the AHI, with a substantial proportion of the heritability explained by obesity.</br>Other inherited traits that might predispose an indi- vidual to developing OSA include craniofacial morphology and ventilatory control.</br>Familial environmental factors such as physical activity and eating habits may play a role as well.</br>Nevertheless, genetic studies to date have not identified a unique gene or genes responsible for OSA heritability. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications As documented in longitudinal population studies, the severity of untreated OSA mea- sured by the AHI tends to slowly progress over time.</br>OSA becomes more severe in patients whose BMI increases, but may improve with weight reduction.</br>However, the effect of weight gain on increasing OSA severity is greater than the impact of weight loss on decreasing OSA severity.</br>Moreover, the consequences of weight change are more evident in men than women. </br>Substantial evidence implicates OSA as a risk factor for incident systemic hyper- tension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, and premature mortality.</br>Data suggest that these effects are more evident in men and middle-aged individuals.</br>In addition, there is accumulating evidence to suggest that OSA is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus independent of obesity.</br>Various arrhythmias are commonly observed in association with OSA.</br>Evidence suggests that OSA is particularly related to the onset and recurrence of atrial fibrillation. </br>OSA may increase the severity of depression.</br>Because of daytime sleepiness, func- tional impairment occurs commonly as manifested by poor job performance, loss of employment, impaired family relationships, and reduction in overall quality of life.</br>The risk of motor vehicle accidents is significantly increased among those with OSA. </br>Developmental Issues OSA can occur in any age group, but in adults, prevalence accelerates between young adulthood and middle age, with a plateau reached after approximately age 65 years.</br>Although OSA occurs in the elderly, it is commonly observed with few symptoms.</br>In addition, some evidence suggests that risk of cardiovascular disease related to OSA may be less important in the elderly.</br>This has raised the possibility that its presence in this age group represents a distinct clinical variant.</br>Pediatric OSA is discussed in a separate section (below). </br>58 Pathology and Pathophysiology The pathophysiology underlying upper airway narrowing during sleep is multifactorial.</br>Patients with OSA commonly have reduced cross-sectional area of the upper airway lumen due to either excessive bulk of soft tissues (tongue, soft palate, and lateral pha- ryngeal walls) or craniofacial anatomy, or both.</br>During inspiration, negative pressure is generated in the lumen of the upper airway, promoting closure.</br>However, pharyngeal dilating muscles act to maintain patency.</br>The activity of these muscles decreases with sleep onset, but is normally adequate to maintain an open airway.</br>In persons with OSA, the activity of the pharyngeal dilating muscles becomes insufficient to prevent narrow- ing and/or closure of the upper airway.</br>This state-dependent change is the major con- tributing factor leading to an obstructed upper airway.</br>There is a further reduction in tone and phasic activity of pharyngeal dilating muscles during REM sleep, particularly in phasic REM, which likely contributes to apneas and hypopneas that are longer and more pronounced.</br>Decreased end-expiratory lung volume and falling ventilatory drive associated with hypocapnia also predispose to upper airway narrowing or closure.</br>In the breaths leading up to obstructive apnea, end-expiratory upper airway caliber pro-</br>gressively decreases.</br>Smaller end-expiratory lung volume may result in smaller upper airway size due to decreased downward traction (tracheal tug).</br>Some patients have unstable ventilatory control (high loop gain) with resulting periods of hypocapnia that may also contribute to upper airway narrowing. </br>The mechanisms of apnea/hypopnea termination are controversial.</br>Event termination may occur with or without an associated arousal.</br>Some events may resolve with aug- mentation of upper airway muscle tone from chemical (low PaO2, high PaCO2) and mechanical (upper airway mechanoreceptors) stimuli, whereas others may depend on a change of sleep state (arousal) at either a cortical or subcortical level.</br>Cortical arous- als are associated with changes detectable by EEG, whereas other changes of state may be detectable only by direct or indirect measures of sympathetic tone.</br>Even if arousals are not required for termination of all obstructive events, sleep fragmentation from arousals is nevertheless believed to be a significant cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.</br>Apneas and hypopneas typically last considerably longer in REM and, in some patients, are only present in this sleep stage.</br>The explanation for this finding is unknown. </br>As an apnea or hypopnea event progresses, the patient gradually becomes more hypox- emic; the degree of oxygen desaturation is dependent not only on the duration of the event, but also on the patient’s baseline oxygen saturation and lung volume and the presence of comorbid lung conditions.</br>Slight hypercarbia also occurs during apneas and hypopneas and is worse during REM sleep. </br>59 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Accumulating evidence indicates that persons with OSA have elevated levels of circu- lating inflammatory mediators related to repetitive episodes of oxygen desaturation and increased sympathetic nervous system activity.</br>Both of these findings may be import- ant in the pathogenesis of hypertension and cardiovascular disease related to OSA. </br>Objective Findings Obstructive apneas are documented by a cessation of airflow with ongoing respiratory efforts during PSG or an OCST.</br>When breathing effort is recorded with respiratory inductance plethysmography, it typically shows paradoxical movement of the rib cage and abdomen.</br>If esophageal manometry is used, increasingly large swings between inspiratory and expiratory efforts are observed.</br>Obstructive hypopneas are a reduction rather than a cessation of airflow with ongoing respiratory effort.</br>Increasing respira- tory effort with constant or reduced flow is indicative of increased upper airway resis- tance.</br>This state is most accurately identified with a quantitative measurement of flow and esophageal manometry, although it can be inferred when there is obvious inspira- tory airflow limitation (flattening of the inspiratory flow) on a nasal pressure recording.</br>Although patients with OSA have predominantly obstructive events, they may also have variable amounts of central apneas.</br>In some patients, these resolve with admin- istration of positive airway pressure, whereas in others frequent central apneas either persist or emerge, at least during the initial night of positive airway pressure treatment. </br>Oxygen saturation typically declines for a variable period of time following the onset of an event (apnea or hypopnea), with the nadir usually occurring after normal breath- ing resumes.</br>The degree of oxygen desaturation may range from as little as 1% to 2%, up to 30% to 40% or greater.</br>If the baseline oxygen saturation is normal, there may be no discernible drop in oxygen saturation despite evidence of airflow limitation fol- lowed by arousal.</br>As a result, some events associated with evidence of increased respi- ratory effort (and/or flattening of inspiratory flow) and an arousal at event termination may not meet diagnostic criteria for apnea or hypopnea.</br>These events are defined as RERAs.</br>These events are presumed to have the same underlying pathophysiology as obstructive apneas and hypopneas (upper airway obstruction) and are considered to be as much of a risk factor for symptoms of unrefreshing sleep, daytime somnolence, and fatigue as frank apnea or hypopnea. </br>The EEG may provide evidence of a brief arousal from sleep, and the submental electro- myogram may demonstrate a burst of activity indicating upper airway dilating muscle activation immediately preceding the resumption of normal breathing.</br>Microphones may record a sudden resumption of loud snoring.</br>Obstructive apneas and hypopneas may be accompanied by bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, or both; however, the prevalence of this finding in patients varies widely.</br>At the time of arousals, there is often a surge in both sympathetic nervous system activity and systemic blood pressure. </br>Differential Diagnosis In contrast to patients with OSA, those with isolated snoring will not exhibit obstruc- tive apneas, hypopneas, or RERAs on PSG or OCST and do not have other sleep symp- toms attributable to breathing disturbance.</br>However, because arousal-based hypopneas and RERAs cannot be identified with OCST, OSA cannot be excluded if the OCST is negative. </br>Patients with central sleep apnea have predominantly central rather than obstruc- tive apneas, hypopneas, or RERAs as the primary finding on PSG or OCST.</br>If mixed apneas are predominant, a diagnosis of OSA should be made. </br>Patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome will demonstrate daytime hypercap- nia.</br>Snoring may not be a prominent feature, although daytime sleepiness can occur.</br>Patients with sleep related hypoventilation disorders may show episodes of oxygen desaturation without evidence of airflow obstruction on PSG or OCST.</br>Confirmation of nocturnal hypercapnia will be diagnostic.</br>However, if obstructive apneas or hypo- pneas are evident, a diagnosis of OSA should be made instead of, or in addition to, the diagnosis of sleep related hypoventilation. </br>OSA must be differentiated from other causes of sleepiness such as narcolepsy, idio- pathic hypersomnia, and insufficient sleep.</br>These conditions often can be identified on the basis of history, but PSG and/or MSLT may be required to confirm the diagnosis. </br>OSA should be distinguished from other causes of nocturnal dyspnea, such as noc- turnal panic attacks, nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea from congestive heart failure, and nocturnal angina pectoris.</br>In many cases, absence of snoring and daytime sleepiness will be highly suggestive of etiologies other than OSA.</br>However, the absence of obstructive apneas, hypopneas, or RERAs on PSG will definitively exclude OSA as the diagnosis. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions </br>Although substantial evidence implicates OSA as a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke, it has not been clearly demonstrated that treatment mitigates this risk.</br>This is especially a concern for patients with mild OSA who are not hypersom- nolent.</br>The pathophysiologic mechanisms linking OSA to increased risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, and hypertension require further investigation.</br>Although there Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders is a clear association between OSA and type 2 diabetes mellitus, further studies are needed to determine whether OSA is an independent risk factor and what mechanisms are involved. </br>Bibliography Berry RB, Brooks R, Gamaldo CE, Harding

Labored, paradoxical, or obstructed breathing during the child’s sleep. </br>3. Sleepiness, hyperactivity, behavioral problems, or learning problems. </br>B.

Snoring. </br>b. Flattening of the inspiratory nasal pressure waveform.</br>c. Paradoxical thoracoabdominal motion. </br>Notes .</br>Respiratory events defined according to the most recent version of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. </br>Essential Features Pediatric criteria for OSA apply to patients younger than 18 years.</br>However, for the purpose of PSG scoring, the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events states that adult diagnostic criteria may be used for patients aged 13 to 18 years. </br>Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Pediatric OSA is characterized by intermittent complete or partial obstruction (obstruc- tive apnea or hypopnea); prolonged partial upper airway obstruction; or both prolonged and intermittent obstructions that disrupt normal ventilation during sleep, normal sleep patterns, or both.</br>Children with OSA may demonstrate several breathing patterns during sleep.</br>Some children have cyclic episodes of obstructive apnea, similar to that of adults with the syndrome.</br>However, some patients, particularly younger children, have a pattern of obstructive hypoventilation, which consists of long periods of persistent partial upper airway obstruction associated with hypercapnia, arterial oxygen desatu- ration, or both.</br>Some children may manifest a pattern of UARS similar to that seen in adults, including snoring without identifiable airflow obstruction and increasingly negative esophageal pressure swings and cyclic arousals.</br>In children, upper airway obstruction occurs predominantly during REM sleep.</br>Children often do not have cor- tical arousals in response to the upper airway obstruction, although they may have movement or autonomic arousals.</br>Perhaps as a result of this higher arousal threshold, sleep architecture is usually normal, with normal amounts of slow wave sleep.</br>Even short obstructive apneas may be associated with severe hypoxemia because children have a lower functional residual capacity and a higher metabolic rate than adults. </br>Most children with OSA present with a history of snoring and difficulty breathing during sleep.</br>Snoring is usually loud and may be punctuated by pauses and gasps, with associated movements or arousal from sleep.</br>However, some patients, particu- larly infants and those with neuromuscular weakness, may not snore.</br>Patients with obstructive hypoventilation often have continuous snoring without pauses or arous- als.</br>Children have a very compliant rib cage.</br>As a result, paradoxical breathing is a prominent sign in these patients (note that paradoxical breathing during REM sleep is a normal phenomenon in young children up to at least age three years).</br>A pectus excavatum may be present.</br>Thoracic retractions may be present.</br>Children may sleep in unusual positions, such as seated or with their neck hyperextended.</br>Diaphoresis may be observed.</br>Morning headaches may also occur.</br>Many parents of children with OSA are so concerned about their child’s breathing that they sleep with their child or stimu- late their child to terminate the apneas. </br>Excessive daytime sleepiness may be present, especially in older children and adoles- cents, but is seen less commonly in children than in adults with OSA.</br>Developmental, behavioral, and learning issues are frequently present.</br>These may include attention problems, hyperactivity, moodiness, irritability, and impaired academic performance. </br>64 Associated Features Hypoxemia and hypercapnia are often present during sleep and may be severe.</br>A prom- inent sinus arrhythmia is often seen, although other arrhythmias are rare.</br>Secondary enuresis may occur.</br>Breathing during wakefulness is normal, although mouth breath- ing secondary to adenoidal hypertrophy may be present.</br>Other nonspecific daytime symptoms related to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, such as frequent upper respiratory tract infections or dysphagia, may occur.</br>Although studies have shown that children with OSA generally have larger tonsils and adenoidal tissue than do other children, the size of the tonsils and adenoidal tissue does not predict disease in individual patients. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Clinical presentations include OSA, obstructive hypoventilation, and recurrent arousal associated with increased respiratory effort (RERAs). </br>Demographics The prevalence in children has been estimated at 1% to 4%, but the prevalence may currently be higher due to the pediatric obesity epidemic.</br>The prevalence in infants and adolescents is unknown.</br>In prepubertal children, the disease occurs equally among boys and girls; in adolescents, data suggest the prevalence may be higher in males.</br>There appears to be a higher prevalence in black children than white children; the prev- alence in other ethnic groups is unknown.</br>The disease can occur at any age, from the neonatal period to adolescence, but in otherwise healthy children it is most common in the preschool age (in association with adenotonsillar hypertrophy) and in adolescents (in association with obesity). </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obesity are the most common predisposing/precip- itating factors.</br>Children with craniofacial abnormalities, particularly micrognathia or midfacial hypoplasia, are at risk.</br>Those with Down syndrome are particularly at risk for having OSA.</br>Children with neuromuscular diseases often have upper airway muscle weakness, which predisposes to airway collapse.</br>Children with cerebral palsy may be predisposed to OSA because of spasticity, weakness, or incoordination of the upper airway muscles.</br>Infants with gastroesophageal reflux may develop OSA due to upper airway edema or laryngospasm.</br>Other medical conditions such as mucopoly- saccharidosis and sickle cell disease may predispose to OSA.</br>Pharyngeal flap oper- ations, typically performed to improve speech quality in patients with cleft palate, can result in OSA.</br>Environmental tobacco smoke exposure has been associated with snoring and OSA. </br>65 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Familial Patterns There is evidence for an increased risk of OSA in children with affected family members.</br>Potential mechanisms for familial aggregation include heritability of pre- disposing skeletal, soft tissue, body habitus, or respiratory control characteristics.</br>However, the relative roles of genetic factors versus environmental factors have not been determined. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications The exact course of pediatric OSA has not been well studied.</br>Symptoms typically begin within the first few years of life, although the disease may not be diagnosed until many years later.</br>The natural course of untreated OSA is not known.</br>A few short-term studies suggest that some children with mild disease may improve, or conversely, have worsening of the condition; long-term studies are not available.</br>Complications are frequent and may be severe.</br>In early childhood, OSA can cause growth failure, especially when associated with a comorbid genetic or craniofacial disorder.</br>Cognitive and behavioral complications are common and may include developmental delay, poor school performance, attention deficit hyperactivity dis- order, inattention and impairment in concentration, and aggressive behavior.</br>Rarely, cases of severe asphyxial brain damage, seizures, and coma have been reported.</br>Cardiovascular complications include pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and systemic hypertension. </br>Developmental Issues Developmental issues are reviewed within individual sections. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology In children, as in adults, OSA results from a combination of abnormal neuromuscular control and anatomical narrowing of the collapsible (supracartilaginous) portion of the upper airway.</br>During wakefulness, the patient with OSA compensates by augmenting upper airway muscle tone to dilate the upper airway; thus, obstructive apnea does not occur.</br>During sleep, there is a decrease in ventilatory drive and in neuromuscular tone, facilitating upper airway collapse.</br>The resultant recurrent hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and sleep disruption may lead to neurobehavioral, cardiovascular, and growth abnor- malities.</br>Childhood OSA has also been associated with metabolic and inflammatory abnormalities. </br>In most children who are otherwise healthy, upper airway narrowing is primarily due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy.</br>Pediatric OSA also occurs in association with obesity, which is becoming increasingly prevalent.</br>Other causes for upper airway narrowing include craniofacial anomalies, particularly those involving midface hypoplasia or micrognathia/retrognathia.</br>In addition, children with decreased upper airway muscle tone or abnormal upper airway muscle function, such as children with muscular dys- trophy or cerebral palsy, are at increased risk for OSA. </br>Objective Findings PSG demonstrates obstructive and mixed apneas, hypopneas, or periods of obstructive hypoventilation.</br>In children, obstructive apneas lasting two respiratory cycles or longer are scored.</br>In contrast to adults with OSA, EEG arousals may or may not be present fol- lowing apneas, especially in young children, although subcortical/autonomic arousals (as manifested by body movements, tachycardia, or measurements of pulse transit time or arterial tonometry) may occur.</br>Possibly as a result of the higher arousal threshold, sleep architecture is usually preserved.</br>Apneas and hypopneas occur primarily during REM sleep, and breathing may be totally normal during NREM sleep.</br>Obstructive events are frequently associated with desaturation and hypercapnia.</br>Evaluation of the upper airway by endoscopy, radiography, computed tomographic scans, or magnetic resonance imaging studies may show large tonsils and adenoidal tissue and a narrow upper airway, although these tests are not performed routinely.</br>Echocardiography may show evidence of right, left, or biventricular hypertrophy. </br>Differential Diagnosis Pediatric OSA must be differentiated from isolated snoring.</br>Children with snoring but without observed apnea, labored breathing during sleep, daytime behavioral issues, sleepiness, or other symptoms of OSA may not require further laboratory investigation.</br>However, children who have snoring and symptoms of OSA need evaluation to deter- mine whether they have isolated snoring or OSA (N.B. this distinction cannot reliably be made clinically but should be based on PSG).</br>Children with primary snoring do not have apneas, gas exchange abnormalities, or frequent arousals on PSG.</br>Central sleep apnea can be differentiated from OSA by the lack of chest or abdominal wall move- ment associated with the central apneas.</br>Mixed apneas may be seen and are included in the diagnosis of OSA.</br>Children with fixed upper airway obstruction due to struc- tural abnormalities tend to obstruct both awake and asleep, and have stridor rather than snoring.</br>OSA in children must be distinguished from nonobstructive alveolar hypoventilation.</br>Children with lung or chest wall disease may have desaturation and hypercapnia during sleep.</br>It may be difficult to separate nonobstructive hypoventila- tion and desaturation from OSA, especially because the two conditions may coexist.</br>In general, children with nonobstructive hypoventilation will not snore and will not have paradoxical inward rib cage motion during inspiration, although the latter may be present in children with neuromuscular disease.</br>OSA must be differentiated from Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders other causes of sleepiness such as narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and insufficient sleep.</br>Sleep related epilepsy may mimic obstructive apnea during sleep and may be indistinguishable from OSA without the appropriate EEG monitoring, especially in infants who may have only subtle motor components of seizures. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions There is a need for further research in many aspects of pediatric OSA.</br>Although studies of prevalence have been performed in the past, the prevalence has probably increased in recent years due to the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity.</br>Further data regarding the prevalence in infants and adolescents is needed.</br>The natural course of the disease, the optimal techniques for monitoring patients during PSG, the effects of mild OSA, and the threshold necessitating treatment require further study.</br>The role of genetic, ethnic, and anatomic factors in the pathophysiology of childhood OSA also requires further study. </br>Bibliography Arens R, Marcus CL.</br>Pathophysiology of upper airway obstruction: a developmental perspective.</br>Sleep 2004;27:997–1019. </br>Arens

used for diagno- sis.</br>Although OSA predominates, central sleep apnea is also common especially in the first few days following stroke.</br>CSA-CSB has been reported to occur in 26% to 50% of patients in the acute period following stroke. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors The most important predisposing factors are the presence of congestive heart failure, stroke, and possibly renal failure.</br>Within the heart failure population, risk factors for CSB pattern during sleep include male sex, age older than 60 years, the presence of atrial fibrillation, and daytime hypocapnia (i.e., awake PaCO2 of 38 mm Hg or less).</br>In general, greater pulmonary congestion (higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) predicts lower PaCO2.</br>Some studies suggest that CSA-CSB occurs more commonly in the supine position.</br>Although renal failure is often listed as a possible cause of CSA- CSB, there is scant literature documenting this association. </br>Familial Patterns Not applicable or known. </br>71 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Onset, Course, and Complications There are no definitive data concerning the onset.</br>However, because it is seen in the setting of congestive heart failure, stroke, and possibly renal failure, CSA with CSB most likely has its onset following the development of one of these illnesses.</br>In the setting of systolic congestive heart failure, it is associated with a poor prognosis, as indicated by a greater adjusted relative risk for mortality-cardiac transplantation com- pared to patients without CSB.</br>These data suggest that CSB pattern during sleep par- ticipates in the pathophysiology and progression of heart failure.</br>Its clinical signifi- cance in the setting of stroke or other neurological disorders remains less certain.</br>In some patients with CSA after stroke, the pattern can transition to one of OSA.</br>The presence of obstructive apnea following stroke has been found to be associated with a worse prognosis. </br>Developmental Issues Although there are reports of CSB in children, the condition is extremely rare in this age group.</br>Of interest, one study of patients with congestive heart failure across all age groups found CSB to be absent in children but present in 40% of the adult patients with congestive heart failure.</br>A limitation of the study was that only ten children with congestive heart failure were studied. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology CSA with CSB generally arises because of instability in the respiratory control system.</br>A high ventilatory drive and delay in chemoreceptor response to changes of PaCO2 and PaO2 (due to increased circulation time) are likely the major factors.</br>This breathing disorder tends to occur in individuals with a chronically low PaCO2 when awake and asleep.</br>Hyperventilation occurs due to an increase in the responsiveness of the periph- eral and central chemoreceptors.</br>The increased responsiveness is believed to be due to both increased sympathetic tone and stimulation of vagal irritant receptors in the lungs by pulmonary congestion.</br>The PaCO2 in individuals with CSB pattern and heart failure is closer to their apneic threshold than in those without CSB pattern (primarily due to a smaller sleep related rise in PaCO2 in those with CSB), so that even modest increases in ventilation can drive PaCO2 below the apneic threshold.</br>The most common trigger factor for central apnea is an arousal from sleep, which abruptly augments ventilation and drives PaCO2 below the apneic threshold. </br>The crescendo-decrescendo pattern of tidal volume results from prolonged lung-to-che- moreceptor circulatory delay, such that changes in PaCO2 in the lung are trans- mitted only very slowly to the chemoreceptors, resulting in a gradual buildup and falloff of ventilatory stimulation.</br>The length of the cycle is directly proportional to lung-to-chemoreceptor circulation time and inversely proportional to cardiac output.</br>Accordingly, whereas the length of the ventilatory-apneic cycle in primary CSA is typically shorter than 40 seconds, in CSB pattern it is almost invariably longer than 40 seconds (usually 45-90 seconds).</br>One study of patients with varying degrees of heart failure found a considerably shorter cycle time in patients with normal ejection frac- tion (e.g., diastolic heart failure).</br>The pathophysiology of CSB pattern in the setting of stroke and renal failure has not been examined in any detail.</br>However, apneas in association with these medical disorders are believed to be due to a reduction in PaCO2 below the apneic threshold.</br>In individuals with renal failure, pulmonary congestion (volume overload) may play a role in stimulating hyperventilation. </br>Objective Findings The polysomnographic hallmarks of CSB pattern are recurrent central apneas and central hypopneas alternating with ventilatory periods having a prolonged crescen- do-decrescendo pattern of airflow (tidal volume).</br>CSB pattern typically occurs at the transition from wakefulness to NREM sleep and during stages N1 and N2.</br>It tends to dissipate in stages N3 and R.</br>In stage N3 sleep the sleeping PaCO2 is higher (further above the apneic threshold).</br>During REM sleep the hypoxic and hypercapnic ventila- tory responses are lower, thereby reducing the tendency for an overshoot in ventilation which may drive PaCO2 below the apneic threshold. </br>Arousals are frequently seen in association with CSB and are typically noted at or near the zenith in respiratory effort (or airflow), although can occur at or near the onset of the respiratory phase pattern.</br>In contrast, arousals tend to occur at apnea termination in other CSA disorders.</br>As noted above, a longer respiratory phase (and cycle length) is associated with lower cardiac output and longer circulation time. </br>Central hypopnea, rather than apnea, can occur at the nadir in respiratory effort in patients with CSB and have been included in calculation of the central AHI in a sub- stantial number of investigations.</br>Central hypopneas are characterized by the absence of snoring, flattening in the nasal pressure or PAP device flow signal, and thoracoab- dominal paradox. </br>Central apneas and central hypopneas are usually accompanied by modest oxyhemo- globin desaturation; arterial oxygen saturation seldom falls below 80% to 85%.</br>The combination of oxygen desaturation and arousals from sleep leads to sleep fragmenta- tion with reduced amounts of stage N3 sleep.</br>Additionally, PaCO2 less than 40</br>mm Hg is typically observed during wakefulness.</br>In patients with both obstructive and central apneas, the proportion of central apneas tends to increase over the night, and this is Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders associated with a fall in the sleeping PaCO2.</br>The lower sleeping PaCO2 is thought to be due to an increase in pulmonary congestion during the night with stimulation of juxta- capillary (J) receptors in the lung interstitium and a subsequent increase in ventilatory drive.</br>As noted above, some patients have more CSA-CSB in the supine position. </br>Differential Diagnosis Primary CSA can usually be distinguished from CSB pattern by the absence of a history of heart failure, stroke, or renal failure and by the absence of a crescendo-decrescendo breathing pattern between central apneas.</br>The cycle length (apnea + ventilatory phase) in primary CSA is typically less than 40 seconds.</br>High-altitude periodic breathing only occurs at high altitude and is not associated with heart failure, stroke, or renal failure.</br>Patients with CSA due to drug or substance have a history of use of this type of medication, and an ataxic breathing pattern may be present.</br>If patients with CSA asso- ciated with

Features CSA that is attributed to a medical or neurological condition (and does not have the pattern of CSB) is classified here.</br>The majority of these patients have brainstem lesions of developmental, vascular, neoplastic, degenerative, demyelinating, or traumatic origin. </br>Associated Features Patients generally present with sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, or insomnia.</br>Other signs and symptoms that are often, but not invariably, present include snoring, witnessed apnea, and awakening with shortness of breath.</br>The presentation varies with the cause of central apnea and may include neurological findings. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes None.</br>Some of the common medical and neurological disorders causing central apnea not associated with CSB are listed in Pathology and Pathophysiology (below). </br>Demographics The prevalence and demographics of this disorder vary with the underlying etiology.</br>Patients with Chiari malformation (CM) can present in infancy or childhood, but the most common age of presentation is 20 to 40 years.</br>Patients with stroke tend to be older. </br>76 Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Because of the heterogeneity of etiologies in this type of CSA, predisposing and pre- cipitating factors are variable.</br>In CM there is herniation of a portion of the brainstem through the foramen magnum.</br>In CM type 1, a portion of the cerebellar tonsils herni- ate.</br>CSA in these patients is believed to occur due to impaired function of ventilatory control centers in the brainstem. </br>Familial Patterns None known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications These factors vary as well with the different etiologies.</br>In CM the presentation is typi- cally age 20 to 40 years of age but can occur in infants and children.</br>With the increased use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cases are often diagnosed before symptoms are severe.</br>The CSA following a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is abrupt in onset.</br>In patients exhibiting both central and obstructive apnea, the central apneas tend to resolve with time.</br>Some post-CVA patients with central apneas have central apnea with CSB, whereas in others the CSA does not have a pattern consistent with CSB.</br>The central apneas can lead to sleep fragmentation, yielding either hypersomnolence or insomnia or both.</br>There is little evidence that these apneas or their associated hypoxia and hypercapnia lead to pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, or other adverse car- diovascular consequences. </br>Developmental Issues Not known. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology CSA is caused by failure of the ventilatory control centers to initiate ventilatory effort.</br>The abnormality is due to dysfunction of central ventilatory control centers.</br>The pres- ence of sleep may unmask ventilatory control abnormalities with the loss of the wake- fulness stimulus.</br>Sleep related hypoventilation and/or daytime hypoventilation may coexist with CSA due to medical or neurological disorder, not CSB, in which case both diagnoses can be made. </br>A number of causes of CSA due to medical or neurological disorders–not Cheyne- Stokes—have been described.</br>Patients with CM exhibit obstructive, central, or a mixture of obstructive and central apneas.</br>Some patient exhibit nocturnal hypoventi- lation but rarely daytime hypoventilation.</br>CSA and/or OSA can be the initial presenta- tion of the disorder.</br>Symptoms include headache (especially with laughter, coughing, Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders or exertion), neck pain, and vertigo.</br>An MRI is diagnostic of the condition and should be considered as part of the evaluation of all patients without an obvious cause of central apnea. </br>Brainstem neoplasm can present with central apnea not of the Cheyne-Stokes type.</br>Patients with a recent cerebrovascular accident show a high incidence of sleep disor- dered breathing.</br>Although obstructive apnea is more common, central apnea may be noted initially after a cerebrovascular accident.</br>Some patients exhibit a pattern of CSB, whereas in others periodic breathing without the characteristic CSB pattern is present.</br>Patients with multiple system atrophy may also present with CSA that does not have a CSB pattern. </br>Objective Findings The polysomnogram of the patient with CSA due to medical or neurological condi- tion—not CSB—demonstrate recurrent (five or more per hour) central apneas and/or central hypopneas.</br>The central apneas and hypopneas meet criteria for these events as defined by the most recent version of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events.</br>Runs of recurrent central apneas separated by periods of ventilation may occur.</br>The interevent respiratory phase is typically brief with a maximum of five breaths.</br>The central apneas do not have the pattern of CSB. </br>Differential Diagnosis Patients with CSA due to medical or neurological disorder—not CSB—should be dif- ferentiated from primary CSA, in which no known cause is identified.</br>As the name implies, patients with a pattern of CSB should be classified as such.</br>Patients with central nervous system neoplasms may have a central hypoventilation syndrome with sleep related hypoventilation with or without an increase in daytime PaCO2. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions With the possible exception of poststroke central apnea, the disorders classified here are thought to be relatively rare.</br>The presenting symptoms may not be a sleep related complaint.</br>Except for those associated with CM and poststroke CSA, the disorders are not well characterized. </br>Bibliography

), or substance use disorders. </br>Notes .</br>Typically at least 2,500 meters (8,202 feet), although some individuals may exhibit the disorder at altitudes as low as 1,500 meters. </br>2. Periodic breathing is a common response to altitude.</br>Associated symptoms are required to make the diagnosis of a disorder.</br>There is no level of the central AHI separating a normal and abnormal response to high altitude. </br>3.</br>A diagnosis of CSA due to high-altitude period breathing does not exclude a diagnosis of OSA. </br>79 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Essential Features High-altitude periodic breathing is characterized by alternating periods of central apnea and hyperpnea associated with recent ascent to high altitude.</br>The pattern of periodic breathing is an expected response to ascent to elevation.</br>Only those individuals who manifest related symptoms, as described below, are diagnosed with this disorder.</br>The cycle length of this respiratory pattern is commonly less than 40 seconds and often as short as 12 to 20 seconds.</br>The percentage of individuals exhibiting periodic breathing during sleep increases at higher altitudes.</br>Approximately 25% exhibit periodic breath- ing at 2,500 meters (8,202 feet), and virtually 100% demonstrate periodic breathing at 4,000 m (13,123 feet).</br>Periodic breathing has been described at altitudes as low as 1,500 meters (4,900 feet).</br>Chronic exposure to altitude above 2,500 meters has also been associated with periodic breathing in some studies. </br>Associated Features At altitude, individuals may complain of frequent awakenings, poor-quality sleep, and a sense of dyspnea.</br>These symptoms will often improve with time at moderate altitude but may persist at extreme altitude.</br>Alterations in sleep associated with ascent to alti- tude include a reduction in stage N3 sleep and increased arousal frequency.</br>Total sleep time and the amount of REM sleep are either unchanged or decreased.</br>Of note, the degree of both subjective and objective impairment of sleep quality was not correlated with the severity of periodic breathing in a number of studies. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes None known. </br>Demographics The demographics of high-altitude periodic breathing are not known.</br>High-altitude periodic breathing tends to occur in individuals with a high hypoxic and probably hypercapnic ventilatory response.</br>Because men generally have higher chemorespon- siveness than women, high-altitude periodic breathing may be more common in men than in women.</br>As stated above, periodic breathing will occur in virtually anyone ascending to higher than 4,000 meters and in some individuals at lower altitudes.</br>The latter group probably comprises individuals with increased hypoxic chemoresponsive-</br>ness.</br>In one study, individuals both with and without periodic breathing at altitude had alterations in sleep architecture.</br>Those with periodic breathing had a greater arousal index, although their sleep architecture was otherwise not significantly different from individuals who did not develop periodic breathing. </br>80 Predisposing and Precipitating Factors The only known predisposing factor for the development of high-altitude periodic breathing is increased ventilatory chemoresponsiveness, primarily hypoxic ventila- tory responsiveness.</br>A high hypoxic ventilatory response will lead to increased hyper- ventilation on ascent to altitude.</br>This hyperventilation leads to hypocapnic alkalosis that, during sleep, inhibits ventilation.</br>Thus, repetitive cycles of apnea and hyperpnea develop during NREM sleep.</br>The obvious precipitating factor for the development of this periodic breathing is ascent to altitude.</br>The more rapid the ascent, the more likely periodic breathing is to develop. </br>Familial Patterns Some data suggest that ventilatory chemoresponsiveness is directly inherited.</br>Because elevated hypoxic responsiveness is a predisposing variable in the development of high-altitude periodic breathing, it would seem likely that there would be a familial pattern in the development of this respiratory abnormality.</br>However, there are no data addressing this issue. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications This respiratory pattern will generally be evident during sleep immediately after ascent to altitude.</br>This depends to some extent on the rapidity of the ascent, the elevation, and individual predisposition.</br>However, it will be present most often on the first night at altitude.</br>At moderate altitude, the breathing pattern may become more regular over time, although at extreme altitude it is likely to persist.</br>One recent study found that the amount of periodic breathing continued to increase over three days to two weeks of acclimatization.</br>Studies of adaptation to altitude suggest that sleep quality may improve despite further increases in periodic breathing.</br>It has been hypothesized that hypoxia itself may have an important role in disturbing sleep architecture.</br>Thus, sleep and symptoms may improve during acclimatization to altitude even if the amount of periodic breathing actually increases. </br>The complications of high-altitude periodic breathing, which are generally limited to disrupted sleep on the initial nights at altitude, include frequent awakenings, often with shortness of breath or a sensation of suffocation that may lead to fatigue or sleep- iness on the following day.</br>There is no clear association between periodic breathing and other altitude syndromes (high-altitude pulmonary edema, acute mountain sick-</br>ness, and high-altitude cerebral edema).</br>In fact, periodic breathing is a marker of high hypoxic responsiveness, which generally yields improved oxygenation at altitude and a reduced frequency of the maladaptive syndromes. </br>81 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Developmental Issues Relatively little is known about differences between children and adults concerning periodic breathing at altitude.</br>One study did compare breathing in children and their fathers.</br>The children revealed reduced nocturnal oxygen saturation and associated hyperventilation at high altitude similar to the adults, but their breathing pattern was more stable.</br>The investigators hypothesized that children may have a lower apnea threshold for CO2 than adults. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology High-altitude periodic breathing is believed to be a product of the hyperventilation induced by the hypobaric hypoxia encountered at altitude.</br>At 2,500 meters the atmo- spheric pressure is approximately 570 mm Hg and the ideal alveolar PO2 around 55 mm Hg (depending on the level of PaCO2).</br>Actual arterial PO2 values will be lower, especially during sleep.</br>The hypoxic ventilatory response shows a steep increase in ventilation when the arterial PO2 level drops below 55 mm Hg.</br>The increases in venti- lation associated with hypoxemia result in hypocapnic alkalosis.</br>Because PaCO2 is the principal stimulus to respiration during NREM sleep, a low PaCO2 can yield a loss or reduction in respiratory drive, resulting in central apnea or hypopnea.</br>The greater the ventilatory response to hypoxia, the greater the fall in PaCO2.</br>Thus, individuals with brisk hypoxic responses more commonly tend to demonstrate this respiratory pattern.</br>Over the course of the apnea, the PaO2 falls and PaCO2 rises, eventually stimulating a resumption of ventilation.</br>However, after several large breaths, the PaCO2 again falls below the apnea threshold, initiating another pause in breathing.</br>This cycle is then repeated over the course of the night.</br>Of note, the respiratory pattern is often improved during REM sleep with reduced cycling.</br>This is likely due to the decreased hypoxic and hypercapnic responsiveness characteristic of REM sleep.</br>Of interest, in one study the hypoxic ventilatory response continued to increase up to seven days after ascent to altitude.</br>This resulted in a lower PaCO2 and higher PaO2.</br>The reduction in peri- odic breathing in some individuals with adaptation to altitude despite a greater venti- latory response to hypoxemia may be due to a lowering of the apneic threshold.</br>Other studies have found that the amount of periodic breathing continues to increase over three days to two weeks of acclimatization despite improvements in oxygen saturation.</br>The increase in both periodic breathing and oxygen saturation is thought to be due to increased controller gain of the respiratory system. </br>A number of studies have found that the impairment of sleep architecture does not correlate with the degree of periodic breathing.</br>One study found that the amount of periodic breathing was greater on the third night at altitude compared to the first night.</br>However, both the nocturnal oxygen saturation and amount of stage N3 also increased on the third night compared to the first night.</br>It has been hypothesized that hypoxia rather than periodic breathing might be the major factor disturbing sleep. </br>Objective Findings The PSG of individuals with high-altitude periodic breathing demonstrates recur- rent central apneas with a cycle time of less than 40 seconds, and typically around 20 seconds.</br>There is some degree of associated arterial oxygen desaturation.</br>The apneas are short, generally 8 to 10 seconds in duration.</br>In one study, the apnea duration was around 8 seconds (7 to 9 seconds) in children and approximately 12 seconds (10-14 seconds) in adults. </br>The cycle length is commonly less than 40 seconds.</br>This breathing pattern occurs only during NREM sleep with more rhythmic respiration during REM sleep.</br>Because this breathing pattern is a physiologic adaptation to altitude, there is no specific number of apneas per hour of sleep that is considered normal or abnormal.</br>The apneas and associated hyperpnea can lead to recurrent arousals from sleep, which often increase stages N1 and N2 sleep while reducing stage N3 sleep.</br>REM sleep (stage R) duration is generally preserved, as is total sleep time.</br>As noted above, some studies have found a reduction in total sleep time and stage R as well as stage N3.</br>Of interest, the arousal index was only around 25% of the AHI in some investigations. </br>Differential Diagnosis High-altitude periodic breathing should be distinguished from other SRBDs.</br>The major distinguishing factor is, of course, recent ascent to high altitude.</br>An individual with OSA will likely continue to have this nocturnal respiratory problem at altitude.</br>Altitude might even exacerbate the OSA.</br>Patients with chronic mountain sickness demonstrate relative hypoventilation at altitude (i.e., breathe less than is encoun- tered in normal individuals at similar altitude) such that they are more hypoxic than normal individuals who have a greater ventilatory response to the same ambient hypoxia.</br>During sleep, these individuals often demonstrate further arterial oxygen desaturation.</br>Some of the individuals will demonstrate apneas or periodic breathing.</br>A diagnosis of chronic mountain sickness does not imply that periodic breathing is present.</br>However, periodic breathing may be more common in these patients than previously appreciated. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Recent studies suggest that hypoxemia rather than the amount of periodic breathing may be the major factor impairing sleep quality.</br>Further studies relating changes in sleep and periodic breathing at altitude are needed. </br>83 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders

As defined by the most recent version of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. </br>Essential Features Primary CSA is of unknown etiology (idiopathic) and is characterized by recurrent central apneas, defined as a cessation of airflow during sleep associated with an absence of respiratory effort.</br>Airflow and respiratory effort cease simultaneously in a repetitive Sleep Related Breathing Disorders fashion over the course of the night.</br>This recurrent cessation and resumption of venti- lation can lead to sleep fragmentation, yielding excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent nocturnal awakenings, or both.</br>Thus, patients may present with symptoms of hyper- somnolence or insomnia.</br>Patients with primary CSA tend to have low normal arterial PaCO2 during wakefulness (less than 40 mm Hg).</br>Patients with a known medical or neurological disorder that is believed to cause central apneas are classified elsewhere. </br>Associated Features Patients generally present with excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, or insomnia.</br>Other signs and symptoms that are often, but not invariably, present include snoring, witnessed apnea, and awakening with shortness of breath. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes The disorder is rare, precluding identification of any definite subtypes. </br>Demographics Not known.</br>Most studies suggest this disorder is rare, most common in middle-aged to elderly individuals, and more frequent in men than women, although not all studies support this sex bias. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors CSA in these patients occurs because the arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) drops below the hypo- capnic apnea threshold (HAT).</br>During wakefulness, drops in PaCO2 do not result in apnea.</br>However, during sleep, when the PaCO2 drops below the HAT, respiratory effort ceases.</br>For most patients, the HAT is within a few mm Hg of the awake PaCO2.</br>Any factors that narrow the gap between the sleeping PaCO2 and the HAT predispose to central apnea.</br>A high ventilatory response to CO2 seems to be a major predisposing factor in the development of primary CSA.</br>This can lead to the instability in venti- latory control that characterizes the disorder.</br>Frequent arousal from sleep can also predispose to the development of central apneas, as ventilatory control is somewhat unstable at sleep-wake transitions.</br>Increased ventilation associated with arousal can result in a PaCO2 below the HAT after the return to sleep.</br>Because ventilatory drive is lower during REM than NREM sleep, hypocapnic central apnea is much less common during that sleep stage.</br>Two other variables have been discussed as possible predispos- ing factors, although their true role in the development of this syndrome is uncertain.</br>First, frequent arousal or awakening due to low arousal threshold or sleep maintenance insomnia have been reported to lead to an increase in central apneas.</br>Because ventila- tory control can be somewhat unstable in the normal wake-sleep transition with occa- sional central apneas being observed in otherwise normal individuals, any disorder that interrupts sleep may worsen CSA.</br>Some studies have suggested a worsening of primary CSA in the supine position, but this has been more clearly documented in patients with CSB. </br>Familial Patterns Some data suggest that ventilatory chemoresponsiveness is directly inherited.</br>Because elevated CO2 responsiveness is a predisposing variable in the development of idio- pathic CSA, it would seem likely that there would be a familial pattern in the develop- ment of this respiratory abnormality.</br>However, there are no data addressing this issue. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Not known.</br>The apneas can lead to sleep fragmentation, yielding either hypersomno- lence or insomnia.</br>There is little evidence that these apneas or their associated hypoxia and hypercapnia lead to pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, or other adverse car- diovascular consequences. </br>Developmental Issues Criteria for apnea of infancy and apnea of prematurity are detailed elsewhere and it should be noted that central apnea is defined somewhat differently in infants and chil- dren than in adults.</br>Central apneas that are brief (&lt; 20 seconds in duration) and not associated with desaturation or arousal are commonly observed in both premature and term infants. </br>In adults, population studies report an increase in the occurrence of central apnea with increasing age, especially in men. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Primary CSA is caused by instability of the respiratory control system in the transition from wakefulness to sleep and less commonly during stable NREM sleep.</br>Central apnea in patients with primary CSA most often occurs during stages N1 and N2 sleep and is rare during stages</br>N3 and R sleep.</br>Central apneas tend to occur in individuals with a high or increased ventilatory responsiveness to CO2.</br>Arterial PCO2 levels below the hypocapnic apnea threshold lead to a cessation in ventilatory effort and, therefore, a central apnea.</br>Individuals with high CO2 ventilatory responsiveness tend to have lower PaCO2 levels (both daytime and sleep) and a lower gradient between the sleep- ing PaCO2 and the apneic threshold.</br>Hence, a smaller increase in ventilation is required to reach this apnea threshold and inhibit ventilation.</br>Individuals with high chemore- sponsiveness also hyperventilate more in response to small changes in arterial PaCO2.</br>This again often drives the PaCO2 below the apnea threshold, yielding a cessation Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders of ventilation.</br>However, not all factors that cause greater ventilatory drive have the same effect.</br>Studies suggest that although hypoxemia increases chemoresponsiveness to PaCO2, the gap between the PaCO2 and the apneic threshold is smaller (predispos- ing to central apnea).</br>Metabolic acidosis and

 tend to decrease HAT more than they decrease the sleeping PaCO2, resulting in a larger gap between the HAT and the sleeping PaCO2 and lower likelihood of central apnea.</br>Metabolic alkalosis tends to increase HAT as well as decrease ventilatory responsive- ness, yielding a smaller gap between the HAT and sleeping PaCO2. </br>Objective Findings The PSG of the patient with primary CSA demonstrates more than five central apneas and/or central hypopneas per hour of sleep.</br>The central apneas and central hypopneas meet criteria for these respiratory events in adults or children as defined by the most recent version of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events.</br>Published studies of patients with primary CSA have required that &gt; 50% to 85% of respiratory events be central apneas.</br>Periodic breathing characterized by episodes of recurrent central apneas separated by periods of ventilation may occur.</br>The inter- event respiratory phase is typically brief with a maximum of five breaths.</br>The venti- latory phase between central apneas does not have the crescendo-decrescendo pattern of CSB breathing.</br>Central apneas commonly lead to mild arterial oxygen desaturation, although more severe desaturation can occur.</br>Central apneas may also lead to arousal from sleep, causing fragmentation and yielding increased stages N1 and N2 sleep at the expense of stage N3 sleep.</br>As noted above, central apneas in these patients are less common during REM sleep.</br>In summary, respiration, arterial oxygenation, and sleep architecture are affected by this disorder.</br>Additionally, an arterial PaCO2</br>less than 40 mm</br>Hg is typically observed during wakefulness.</br>These patients do not exhibit sleep related hypoventilation. </br>Differential Diagnosis Normal individuals may have a few central apneas in the wake-sleep transition.</br>However, once stable sleep is achieved, these apneas should cease.</br>Normal individuals should not have more than five central apneas per hour of sleep. </br>Primary CSA must be distinguished from other sleep related breathing disorders.</br>Some patients with predominantly OSA will have central apneas during diagnostic or positive airway pressure titration studies.</br>These apneas tend to resolve immediately or over time on positive airway pressure treatment.</br>The pattern of central apneas in primary CSA differs from that of CSA with CSB.</br>Primary CSA lacks the crescendo-decrescendo pattern of respiration between contiguous central apneas noted in patients with CSA with CSB.</br>The cycle length is longer in CSB (greater than 40 seconds and typically 45 to 90 seconds).</br>The longer cycle length in CSB versus primary CSA is due to a longer respiratory phase between central apneas.</br>In primary CSA, the apnea is often terminated abruptly by a large breath, and there are usually no more that 4 to 5 breaths between apneas.</br>Furthermore, most patients with Cheyne-Stokes respiration will have a history of congestive heart failure or a neurological disorder.</br>Patients with central apnea due to substance use, particularly potent long-acting

, may exhibit periodic breathing with central apneas, but the pattern of ventilation between apneas does not have a crescendo-decrescendo pattern and the cycle length is shorter than 40 seconds.</br>In addition, the underlying pattern of breathing is often ataxic (irregular varia- tions in cycle length and tidal volume) and a low respiratory rate may be noted.</br>Unlike primary CSA, central apneas can occur during stage N3 in patients taking

.</br>Patients with CSA due to medical or neurological conditions not of the Cheyne-Stokes pattern often have a history of a known neurological disorder (recent cerebrovascular accident) but in others a high index of suspicion for an underlying disorder is indi- cated.</br>For example, patients with Chiari malformation may present in adulthood with unexplained central apneas and relatively few other symptoms.</br>Thus, primary CSA is a diagnosis based on careful exclusion of other causes of CSA. </br>In sleep related hypoventilation and hypoxemic syndromes, patients have normal or increased daytime arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) with the onset or worsening of hypoven- tilation during sleep.</br>Daytime hypoventilation is defined as a PaCO2 &gt; 45 mm</br>Hg.</br>Patient with primary CSA usually have an awake PaCO2 &lt;</br>40 mm Hg.</br>The causes of sleep related hypoventilation include abnormalities in ventilatory control, neuro- muscular disease, parenchymal lung disease, or restrictive chest wall disorders.</br>PSG in these patients may reveal a few central apneas, but the predominant pattern is one of reduced tidal volume (shallow pattern of breathing), often without a compensatory increase in respiratory rate.</br>There is usually significant oxygen desaturation secondary to hypoventilation and/or ventilation perfusion mismatch.</br>Patients with parenchymal lung disease, neuromuscular disease, or chest wall disorders typically have abnormal pulmonary function tests and the most severe arterial oxygen desaturation typically occurs during REM sleep. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions </br>Although primary CSA is believed to be a relatively rare disorder, additional prevalence data are needed.</br>The pathophysiology of this disorder remains unclear.</br>Specifically, the relative roles of instability in sleep state (low arousal threshold, delayed transition from wake to stable sleep) and respiratory control instability (elevated hypercapnic ventila- tory response) require further elucidation. </br>93 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Bibliography Bixler EO, Vgontzas AN, Lin HM, Ten Have T, Rein J, Vela-Bueno A, Kales A.

Apnea or cyanosis is noted by an observer or an episode of sleep related central apnea or desaturation is detected by monitoring. </br>B. The infant has a conceptional age of at least 37 weeks. </br>94 C. PSG or alternative monitoring such as hospital or home apnea monitoring shows either: .</br>Recurrent, prolonged (&gt; 20 seconds duration) central apneas.1 .</br>Periodic breathing2 for ≥ 5% of total sleep time. </br>D.</br>The disorder is not better explained by another sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, or medication. </br>Notes .</br>Normative data concerning the number of prolonged central apneas per hour are not well established. </br>2. As defined by the most recent version of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. </br>3. Short (&lt; 20 seconds) central apneas associated with significant desaturation are more likely to be a sign of decreased pulmonary reserve than of central nervous system pathology. </br>4. Definitive determination of the central nature of apneas requires simultaneous monitoring of airflow and respiratory effort.</br>Obstructive and mixed apneas may also be present, but central apneas are predominant. </br>Essential Features Primary CSA of infancy is characterized by prolonged, predominantly central apneas in children of at least 37 weeks conceptional age.</br>These events are typically associated with physiological compromise (hypoxemia, bradycardia), or the need for intervention such as stimulation or resuscitation.</br>Obstructive and/or mixed apneas or hypopneas may also be seen, although central events are the predominant finding.</br>It is a disorder of respira- tory control that can be either a developmental problem associated with immaturity of the brainstem respiratory centers or secondary to other medical conditions that produce apnea by mechanisms such as direct depression of central respiratory control.</br>Apnea in the neonate or infant may be exacerbated or precipitated by a variety of medical condi- tions, such as anemia, infection, hypoxemia, metabolic disturbances, gastroesophageal reflux, substances, or anesthesia, which must be recognized and treated to stabilize the apnea.</br>If another medical condition appears to be the cause rather than an exacerbating factor for the CSA, then the condition should be classified as CSA due to a medical or neurological condition, or CSA due to a medication or substance. </br>Despite the heterogeneity of infant risk groups and underlying pathophysiology, most studies report a progressive decrease in frequency of apneas and risk of symptomatic apnea secondary to other medical conditions after the early weeks of life. </br>95 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Associated Features Infants may present with an ALTE (defined by a National Institutes of Health Development Conference as “an episode that is frightening to the observer, and that is characterized by some combination of apnea</br>[</br>central or occasionally obstructive], color change, marked change in muscle tone, choking or gagging.</br>In some cases, the observer fears that the infant has died”).</br>Many infants with primary CSA of infancy will not have an ALTE, and many ALTEs are not associated with apnea.</br>Primary CSA of infancy is state dependent, and the frequency of respiratory events increases during active (REM) sleep.</br>Paradoxical chest wall movements are common during active sleep in infants and may cause a fall in arterial oxygen saturation because of ventilation or perfusion defects associated with a decrease in functional residual capacity.</br>Underlying comorbidities (for example, chronic lung disease or abnormal neurological status) can predispose the infant to having a more severe or prolonged course for apnea.</br>Note that a small upper airway will exaggerate the obstructive elements of this disorder. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Not applicable. </br>Demographics Less than 0.5% of full-term newborns experience symptomatic apnea.</br>Studies have shown that during the first six months of life, 2% of healthy full-term infants will experience at least one apnea event lasting 30 seconds or longer or an apnea that lasts at least 20 seconds and is associated with a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute.</br>Apnea of infancy occurs equally in males and females, and in infants of all races and ethnic groups. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Many factors may precipitate apneic episodes, including gastroesophageal reflux, intra- cranial pathology, substances, anesthesia, metabolic disorders, impaired oxygenation, and infection (including sepsis, meningitis, respiratory

</br>Onset, Course, and Complications Onset is usually in the first weeks or months of life.</br>Some infants may be diagnosed by nursing observations or routine monitoring soon after birth.</br>Older infants may present with an ALTE or may have failure to thrive.</br>The prognosis is generally good, with res- olution of apnea over the first few years of life and no residual sequelae.</br>The

to hypoxic events. </br>Developmental Issues This is a condition of infancy that normally improves over time. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Physiological factors contributing to apnea are related to immaturity of respiratory control.</br>These include developmental alterations in central drive, chemoreceptor or mechanoreceptor responses, and upper airway reflexes.</br>Precipitating factors for wors- ening apnea include gastroesophageal reflux, intracranial pathology, substances, anes- thesia, metabolic disturbances, impaired oxygenation, and infection. </br>Objective Findings Apnea is predominantly central, but obstructive and mixed apneas may occur.</br>Apneas are seen most frequently during REM sleep.</br>Other diagnostic tests, such as a full EEG or evaluation for reflux, may be appropriate in individual cases. </br>Differential Diagnosis Primary CSA of infancy should be distinguished from the normal respiratory pauses that occur during sleep.</br>Normative respiratory data from several large studies show that healthy asymptomatic infants commonly have central respiratory pauses, either as isolated events (particularly during REM sleep) or after sigh breaths or movements. </br>Primary CSA of infancy should be distinguished from the popular clinical term, ALTE, which is not a specific diagnosis but an ill-defined constellation of parent-reported apnea symptoms that range in severity from benign to life threatening. </br>Recurrent, severe infant sleep apnea is usually due to other comorbid conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux, metabolic disease, or unrecognized neurological conditions such as seizures, brainstem malformation, or neurodegenerative condi- tion; thus an evaluation for these conditions should be performed.</br>Another diagnos- tic consideration is a form of child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy) mani- fest as imposed upper airway obstruction or attempted suffocation.</br>Primary CSA of infancy should be disassociated from the postmortem diagnosis of SIDS.</br>Although a small percentage of SIDS victims experience apnea symptoms prior to death, Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders primary apnea in the newborn or infant has not been established as an independent risk factor for SIDS. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Infancy is a developmental period normally characterized by instability of control of breathing; thus, defining what is abnormal is a diagnostic challenge.</br>Further research is needed into the mechanisms of ventilatory control development in the infant and the pathophysiologic factors resulting in infant apnea. </br>Bibliography American Academy of Pediatrics.</br>Apnea, sudden infant death syndrome, and home

 tational age.</br>In the preterm infant, sleep apnea can be anticipated, is primarily related to immaturity, and may require supportive ventilatory and pharmacologic treatment.</br>The condition will improve with maturation unless extenuating conditions, such as hypoxemia due to chronic lung disease or gastroesophageal reflux, are present.</br>Apneas are predominantly central, but mixed or obstructive apneas or hypopneas may be seen.</br>The events are typically associated with physiological compromise (hypoxemia, bra- dycardia) or the need for intervention such as stimulation or resuscitation. </br>Associated Features Apnea in the preterm infant is commonly associated with bradycardia.</br>Primary CSA of prematurity is state dependent, and the frequency of respiratory events increases during active (REM) sleep.</br>Paradoxical chest wall movements are common during active sleep in neonates and may cause a fall in arterial oxygen saturation because of ventilation or perfusion defects associated with a decrease in functional residual capac- ity.</br>Underlying comorbidities (for example, chronic lung disease or abnormal neuro- logical status) can predispose the infant to having a more severe or prolonged course for apnea.</br>Note that a small upper airway will exaggerate the obstructive elements of this disorder. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes None known. </br>99 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Demographics The prevalence of apnea of prematurity varies inversely with conceptional age.</br>In studies, approximately 25% percent of infants who weigh less than 2,500 g at birth and 84% of infants under 1,000 g may experience symptomatic apnea during the neo- natal period.</br>Ninety-two percent of preterm infants will be symptom free by 37 weeks postconceptional age, and 98% by 40 weeks after conception, with resolution in most infants by 43 weeks postconception.</br>Apnea of prematurity occurs equally in males and females, and in infants of all races and ethnic groups. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Developmental delay in respiratory control associated with premature birth is the major predisposing condition.</br>Diverse factors are known to precipitate development of apneic episodes in predisposed preterm infants.</br>These include thermal instability, gastroesophageal reflux, intracranial pathology, substances, anesthesia, metabolic disorders, impaired oxygenation, and infection.</br>Infection with respiratory syncytial virus can increase the frequency and the duration of apneas in predisposed infants.</br>OSA associated with upper airway abnormalities can present as apnea of prematurity.</br>Persistence of apnea after 43 weeks conceptional age should raise suspicion of addi- tional etiologic factors. </br>Familial Patterns None known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications In preterm infants, apnea is rare on day one of life, and its presence usually signals another illness.</br>More typical onset occurs between the second and seventh days.</br>Apnea of prematurity usually ceases by 37 weeks conceptional age but may persist for several weeks beyond term, especially in infants born before 28 weeks postconception; apnea beyond 43 weeks postconception is rare.</br>Adverse outcomes for former preterm infants are more closely related to the prenatal or neonatal course, associated comorbidities, and environmental factors than to the apnea of prematurity per se.</br>For most children, long-term outcomes for uncomplicated apnea of prematurity are excellent.</br>However, the prognosis for infants with persistent recurrent apnea spells requiring frequent resuscitation is more guarded and depends on the cause of the apnea and associated comorbidities. </br>Developmental Issues This is a condition related to prematurity that normally improves over time. </br>100 Pathology and Pathophysiology Physiological factors contributing to apnea are related to immaturity of respiratory control.</br>These include developmental alterations in central drive, chemoreceptor or mechanoreceptor responses, and upper airway reflexes.</br>Precipitating factors for wors- ening apnea in preterm infants include thermal instability, gastroesophageal reflux, intracranial pathology, substances, anesthesia, metabolic disturbances, impaired oxy- genation, and infection. </br>Objective Findings Most premature neonates are diagnosed with apnea of prematurity based on cardio- respiratory monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit, rather than by PSG.</br>When PSG is performed, central apneas are often shown to have a mixed component, with mixed apneas accounting for 50% to 75% of apneas in small premature infants; studies suggest that obstructive-type events account for 10% to 20% of events; and pure central events, 10% to 25%.</br>Periodic breathing may be present. </br>Differential Diagnosis Apnea of prematurity should be distinguished from normal, physiologic respiratory pauses that occur during sleep in infants.</br>Studies have shown that healthy asymptom- atic infants commonly have brief (&lt; 20 second) central respiratory pauses, either as isolated events (particularly during REM sleep) or after sigh breaths or movements (in which case the apneas may be longer).</br>These infants are typically asymptomatic, with no changes in color or muscle tone. </br>The differential diagnosis is long and includes apnea secondary to severe gastroesoph- ageal reflux, central nervous system malformations or hemorrhage, seizures, sepsis, and rarely primary cardiac arrhythmias.</br>Comorbid conditions should be suspected whenever apneas are severe or continue beyond 43 weeks gestation. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions The mechanisms underlying physiologic maturation of ventilatory control are not well understood.</br>Further research is required to determine which infants are at greatest risk for severe apnea. </br>Bibliography American Academy of Pediatrics.</br>Apnea, sudden infant death syndrome, and home monitoring.</br>Pediatrics 2003;111:914–7. </br>Hunt CE, Hufford DR, Bourguignon C, Oess MA.</br>Home documented monitoring of cardiorespiratory pattern and oxygen saturation in healthy infants.</br>Pediatr Res 1996;39:216–22. </br>101 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Kahn A, Rebuffat E, Sottiaux M, Blum D.

Treatment-Emergent Central Sleep Apnea ICD-9-CM code: 327.29 ICD-10-CM code: G47.39 Alternate names Complex sleep apnea. </br>Diagnostic Criteria Criteria A-C must be met A. Diagnostic PSG shows five or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events1 (obstructive or mixed apneas, hypopneas or RERAs) per hour of sleep B. PSG during use of positive airway pressure without a backup rate shows significant resolution of obstructive events and emergence or persistence of central apnea or central hypopnea with all of the following: </br>1. Central apnea—central hypopnea index [CAHI] ≥ 5/hour. </br>2. Number of central apneas and central hypopneas is ≥ 50% of total number of apneas and hypopneas. </br>C. The central sleep apnea is not better explained by another CSA disorder (e.g., CSA with CSB or CSA due to a medication or substance). </br>Notes .</br>Respiratory events defined according the most recent version of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. </br>2. A diagnosis of treatment-emergent central sleep apnea does not exclude a diagnosis of OSA.</br>That is, a diagnosis of OSA can be made based on the diagnostic sleep study. </br>102 Essential Features A diagnosis of treatment-emergent CSA is characterized by predominantly obstructive events (obstructive or mixed apnea or hypopnea) during a diagnostic sleep study with persistence or emergence of CSA during administration of positive airway pressure without a backup rate, despite significant resolution of obstructive respiratory events.</br>If the central apnea is better explained by another CSA disorder, patients are given a diagnosis of OSA and that CSA disorder rather than treatment-emergent CSA (e.g., a patient with heart failure exhibits mainly obstructive events during diagnostic PSG but then exhibits predominantly central apnea with CSB on positive airway pressure). </br>Associated Features Patients with treatment-emergent CSA have several characteristics when placed on positive airway pressure without a backup rate.</br>A high number of arousals persist on PAP treatment, and the AHI is often higher during NREM than REM sleep.</br>This is due to the fact that treatment-emergent central apneas almost invariably occur during NREM sleep.</br>Pressures that are effective in controlling obstructive events during REM sleep prove ineffective during NREM sleep due to emergence of central apneas.</br>If patients can attain stage N3, central apneas often decrease until interrupted by an arousal or transition to a lighter stage of sleep that precipitates another run of central apneas or hypopneas.</br>Patients with treatment-emergent CSA can have persistent sleep fragmentation on CPAP treatment and may report little benefit from therapy. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes None known. </br>Demographics The percentage of patients with persistent or emergent central apnea on the initial poly- somnographic positive airway pressure titration varies from 2% to 20% depending on the characteristics of the group studied (community or referral sleep center) and the methodology.</br>If patients who are taking

 or have underling central apnea with CSB are included, the percentage is at the higher end of the range.</br>The percentage of patients with central sleep apnea that persists on chronic CPAP treatment (approxi- mately 2%) is considerably lower than the percentage identified on the first or second night of CPAP treatment. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors A number of factors have been hypothesized to cause treatment-emergent CSA, but definitive data are not available.</br>The patients presumably have characteristics that would predispose them to instability in ventilatory control or sleep maintenance. </br>103 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders These include a low arousal threshold and high ventilatory controller gain.</br>Studies have found that often a small increase in end-tidal PCO2 can stabilize breathing in patients with treatment-emergent central apneas.</br>Therefore, any events that predis- pose a patient to hypocapnia can trigger treatment-emergent central apnea.</br>In some, but not all studies, the overall AHI on the diagnostic PSG (or diagnostic portion of a split-night PSG) was higher in the treatment-emergent CSA group compared to the patients without this diagnosis.</br>In other studies, patients with treatment-emergent CSA had more central apneas during the diagnostic PSG and were more likely to be male.</br>However, identified risk factors for treatment-emergent CSA vary considerably from study to study. </br>Of note, the emergence of central apnea after treatment of obstructive apnea with tra- cheostomy, maxillomandibular advancement, and oral appliance treatment for OSA has been reported.</br>A case report of the development of central apnea following nasal surgery in a patient with known obstructive apnea has also recently been published. </br>Familial Patterns None known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications The recognition of treatment-emergent CSA follows PAP titration.</br>An accurate esti- mate of the percentage of patients with treatment-emergent central apneas whose central events persist on long-term PAP treatment does not exist, as most published reports are retrospective and had a significant number of patients lost to follow-up.</br>Of interest, one study comparing the results of an initial CPAP titration study with one per- formed after six months of therapy found patients who did not meet criteria for treat- ment-emergent CSA on the initial study but met the criteria on the second study.</br>Those patients with treatment-emergent CSA that do not experience resolution of central apneas on chronic PAP treatment are found to have a high number of residual events on PAP machine interrogation in clinic follow-up.</br>Nocturnal oximetry at home on PAP treatment may show persistent arterial oxygen desaturation.</br>Sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness may persist if a significant number of central apneas remain.</br>There is the potential for poor adherence and acceptance of PAP treatment as a result of this. </br>Developmental Issues Treatment-emergent sleep apnea has not been described in children but this may be due to the relatively small number of children with OSA who are treated with PAP. </br>104 Pathology and Pathophysiology Due to variation in definitions of treatment-emergent CSA, the pathophysiology is not clearly defined.</br>A low arousal threshold and difficulty reaching stage N3 sleep may pre- dispose to sleep instability.</br>Arousals destabilize breathing.</br>A high ventilatory response to PaCO2 and a small difference between the sleeping PaCO2 and the apnea threshold may also predispose patients to treatment-emergent central apneas.</br>Treatment with excessive positive airway pressure may trigger treatment-emergent central apneas in susceptible individuals. </br>Objective Findings PSG during a full night diagnostic study (or diagnostic portion of a split-night PSG) shows predominantly obstructive or mixed apneas and hypopneas of five or more per hour of sleep.</br>PSG with PAP (either a full night titration study or PAP treatment portion of a split night study) without a backup rate shows significant resolution of obstructive events and emergence or persistence of central apneas or central hypopneas.</br>The CAHI is five or greater per hour, and more than 50% of the respiratory events are central in nature.</br>A diagnosis of treatment-emergent CSA excludes patients who manifest central sleep apnea on PAP treatment when the CSA is better explained by another CSA dis- order or by over-titration. </br>PSG with administration of PAP often reveals adequate treatment during REM sleep and stage N3 sleep but repetitive episodes of central events during stages N1 and N2.</br>In some patients, progressive increases in pressure with a goal of preventing airflow limitation reach a “break point” at which central apneas appear. </br>Differential Diagnosis Many patients with OSA have a few central events while on PAP.</br>However, in the majority of cases, the central AHI is not ≥ 5/hour and central events are not ≥ 50% of the total number of apneas and hypopneas.</br>Other patients with OSA, while on PAP, exhibit predominantly central events that are believed to be secondary to a CSA disor- der classified elsewhere.</br>In this case, a diagnosis of both OSA and the CSA disorder is appropriate, rather than a diagnosis of treatment-emergent CSA.</br>For example, a patient taking

</mark>
 has predominantly obstructive events during the diagnostic portion of a split-night PSG.</br>Once obstructive events are eliminated on PAP, CSA with ataxic breathing is noted.</br>A diagnosis of both OSA and CSA due to a medication or substance should be made if criteria for that disorder are met. </br>105 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Unresolved Issues and Further Directions The true incidence of treatment-emergent sleep apnea as well as the percentage of patients who have persistent central apnea on chronic PAP treatment remains to be defined.</br>Further prospective studies with clearly defined inclusion and exclusion crite- ria are needed to better define the exact percentage of patients with treatment-emergent CSA who have persistent CSA after chronic PAP treatment.</br>There may be night-to- night variability in the amount of CSA displayed by a given patient.</br>It is unknown, for example, whether treatment-emergent central apneas that resolve on chronic PAP treatment will re-emerge if the patient discontinues PAP treatment for a period of time and then restarts treatment.</br>A number of factors have been hypothesized to increase the likelihood of treatment-emergent central apneas including overtitration (excessive pressure), undertitration (respiratory effort arousals followed by central apnea), the use of bilevel PAP rather than CPAP, arousals from mask leak, and use of a split night study.</br>Further study is needed to verify that these factors do indeed predispose a patient to develop treatment-emergent central apneas.</br>The evolution of treatment-emergent central apneas on chronic PAP treatment also remains to be determined; that is, to what extent do central events resolve over time and what is the time course of this resolu- tion?</br>In light of the increasing utilization of auto-titrating PAP, further investigation of the incidence of treatment-emergent CSA with this modality is indicated. </br>Bibliography Allam JS, Olson EJ, Gay PC, Morgenthaler TI.</br>Efficacy of adaptive servoventilation in treatment of complex and central sleep apnea syndromes.</br>Chest 2007;132:1839–46. </br>Dernaika T, Tawk M, Nazir S, Younis W, Kinasewitz GT.</br>The significance and outcome of continuous positive airway pressure-related central sleep apnea during split-night sleep studies.</br>Chest 2007;132:81–7. </br>Gay PC.</br>Complex sleep apnea: it really is a disease.</br>J Clin Sleep Med 2008;4:403–5. </br>

’s curse is no longer recommended due to its negative connotations. </br>Diagnostic Criteria Criteria A and B must be met A. Sleep related hypoventilation is present. </br>B. Mutation of the PHOX2B gene is present. </br>Notes .</br>Sleep related hypoventilation may be associated with either daytime hypoventilation (PaCO2 &gt; 45 mm Hg) or normal daytime PaCO2 levels. </br>Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders In either case, the PaCO2 is higher during sleep and meets criteria for sleep related hypoventilation. </br>2. PSG monitoring demonstrates severe hypercapnia and arterial oxygen desaturation.</br>Some central apneas may occur but the predominant pattern is reduced flow/tidal volume. </br>3.</br>Although the condition is termed congenital, some patients with a PHOX2B genotype may present phenotypically later in life (and even in adulthood), especially in the presence of a stressor such as general anesthesia or a severe respiratory illness. </br>Essential Features Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a syndrome of auto- nomic dysfunction, primarily the failure of automatic central control of breathing, due to a mutation of the PHOX2B gene.</br>CCHS is characterized by the onset of hypoven- tilation, usually at birth.</br>The hypoventilation is worse during sleep than wakefulness and is unexplained by primary pulmonary, neurological, or metabolic disease.</br>CCHS typically presents in an otherwise normal-appearing infant who is noted to have cyano- sis, feeding difficulties, hypotonia or, less commonly, central apnea.</br>Some children are diagnosed following cardiovascular collapse.</br>The infant requires intubation and then cannot be weaned from mechanically assisted ventilation, despite appearing vigorous and having a normal chest radiograph.</br>Some infants may appear to breathe adequately on clinical examination but experience episodes of hypoventilation (not necessarily apnea) characterized by hypoxemia and hypercapnia.</br>Patients with CCHS may occa- sionally present later in life with cyanosis, an apparent life-threatening event, cor pul- monale, or hypoxic neurological damage.</br>CCHS has been diagnosed in adults who present with respiratory failure following anesthesia or in association with a minor respiratory illness; these patients usually have a mild mutation, and may have evidence of longstanding hypoxemia including cognitive deficits.</br>Most patients with CCHS have sufficiently severe hypoventilation during sleep that they require mechanically assisted ventilation, although this state-dependent difference may not be apparent during early infancy.</br>Some patients (~15%) hypoventilate during wakefulness as well as during sleep and require continuous ventilatory support.</br>However, most patients with CCHS do not require ventilatory support during wakefulness but may have subtle abnormali- ties in gas exchange when physically inactive or during vigorous exercise. </br>Associated Features Associated autonomic abnormalities include Hirschsprung disease in approximately 16% of patients with CCHS, autonomic dysfunction (e.g., decreased heart rate variabil- ity or hypotension), neural tumors (e.g., ganglioneuromas or ganglioneuroblastomas), swallowing dysfunction during the early years, and ocular abnormalities (e.g., stra- bismus).</br>Most patients are cognitively normal, although developmental delay may be present, especially in patients in whom the hypoventilation has not been well controlled. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Research suggests that severity of illness is related to the type of mutation present.</br>Most patients have a polyalanine expansion mutation; those with more polyalanine repeats are more likely to have severe disease including waking hypoventilation.</br>Patients with a point mutation or frame shift mutations are at greater risk for neural tumors. </br>Demographics The prevalence of CCHS is not known, but the disease is rare.</br>The condition occurs equally among both sexes and all ethnic/racial groups. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors This is a congenital genetic syndrome. </br>Familial Patterns CCHS usually occurs as a de novo mutation, but siblings with the condition have been reported.</br>As the gene is dominant, patients are at risk of having children with CCHS. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications </br>The condition is genetic and is therefore present from birth, but some patients may present later in life.</br>The physiological abnormalities of CCHS persist for life and are not ameliorated over time.</br>However, the clinical consequences of hypoventilation can be prevented by providing adequate ventilatory support.</br>If untreated, death usually results from cor pulmonale or complications of apnea or severe hypoventilation.</br>Patients with poorly controlled CCHS may develop mental retardation, growth failure, seizures, or cor pulmonale.</br>When treated, infants with CCHS may improve over the first six to 12 months.</br>Some patients who initially require ventilatory support 24 hours a day may progress to adequate ventilation during wakefulness.</br>However, patients continue to require ventilatory support during sleep.</br>Conversely, some patients may develop the need for continuous ventilatory support.</br>It is unclear whether these patients had condi- tions that worsened, were not adequately evaluated and treated initially, or were asso- ciated with changing ventilatory demands.</br>Even with treatment, patients with CCHS require close monitoring, particularly during infancy.</br>Minor medical illnesses, such as upper respiratory tract illnesses or diarrhea, may precipitate bouts of respiratory failure.</br>Edema and lethargy are often early signs of impending respiratory failure.</br>The clinical signs of hypoxemia and hypoventilation in these patients may be subtle, as the Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders children do not show signs of distress or increased work of breathing, such as retrac- tions and nasal flaring.</br>As a result, gas exchange abnormalities may progress for some time without notice until the child appears to deteriorate suddenly with cardiopulmo- nary arrest or severe decompensation. </br>Developmental Issues Not applicable. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The exact pathophysiology of CCHS is unknown.</br>Radiologic and postmortem studies have not shown gross central nervous system abnormalities.</br>The PHOX2B gene plays a role in the development of the autonomic system.</br>Functional MRI and physiologic studies have shown widespread cerebral abnormalities in response to stimuli such as exogenous hypercapnia. </br>Objective Findings Hypoxemia and hypercapnia are present on PSG during sleep.</br>Central apneas may be present, but hypoventilation associated with decreased tidal volume and respiratory rate is more common.</br>In contrast to most types of sleep disordered breathing in children, abnormalities may be more severe during NREM than during REM sleep.</br>Patients may not arouse from sleep despite severe gas exchange abnormalities.</br>Paradoxical breath- ing and snoring do not typically occur. </br>Patients with CCHS have flat rebreathing hypoxic and hypercapnic responses, although they may respond to transient ventilatory challenges of the peripheral chemorecep- tors.</br>Arterial blood gases may be normal during wakefulness but will be abnormal if obtained from an arterial line during sleep.</br>In patients with chronically untreated or poorly controlled CCHS, a compensated respiratory acidosis may be present.</br>In these patients, polycythemia may be present and the serum bicarbonate level may be elevated.</br>Computed tomography and MRI scans of the head are normal.</br>Electrocardiography, echocardiography, or cardiac catheterization may reveal evidence of pulmonary hyper- tension.</br>Pulmonary function tests may be normal or show evidence of mild obstructive or restrictive lung disease resulting from associated conditions such as tracheitis. </br>Differential Diagnosis CCHS must be distinguished from other forms of central hypoventilation, such as central hypoventilation due to Chiari malformation, other causes of central nervous system disturbance such as trauma or tumors, metabolic conditions such as Leigh disease, or obesity hypoventilation syndrome.</br>CCHS must also be distinguished from hypoventilation secondary to muscle weakness due to conditions such as diaphrag- matic paralysis or muscular dystrophy.</br>Infants presenting with apnea or an apparent life-threatening event due to causes such as gastroesophageal reflux may be thought to have CCHS.</br>However, these infants typically have intermittent episodes of apnea rather than sustained hypoventilation, and the episodes typically resolve once the primary cause has been treated.</br>CCHS patients presenting with cor pulmonale may be misdiagnosed as having congenital heart disease. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions </br>There are many unresolved issues regarding CCHS, including prevalence data, precise genotype-phenotype correlations, effect of aging on patients with CCHS, long-term outcome of children with CCHS born to parents with CCHS, and the exact nature of the gene-encoded deficit. </br>Bibliography Amiel J, Laudier B, Attie-Bitach T, et al.</br>

, may further worsen respira- tory impairment.</br>Patients who are hypercapnic and hypoxemic during wakefulness will generally become even more so during sleep, in particular REM sleep, but the rela- tionship between wake SaO2/PaCO2 and sleep related desaturation is not sufficiently strong to have substantial predictive value in individual patients. </br>Familial Patterns Genetic patterns for many of the disorders are not known.</br>Alpha-1 antitrypsin defi- ciency is a genetic disorder characterized by defective production of the enzyme inhib- itor; severe forms of deficiency can lead to emphysema.</br>Genetic causes of bronchi- ectasis include primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis.</br>Muscular dystrophies are genetically inherited.</br>The familial patterns of sleep related hypoventilation due to these disorders reflect those of the underlying inherited conditions. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Onset and course of the hypoventilation parallels the presence and severity of the underlying medical or neurological disorders that impair respiration although substan- tial variability in course is observed even within the same underlying condition.</br>Many affected individuals with severe hypercapnia and hypoxemia develop respiratory impairment, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurocog- nitive dysfunction.</br>Polycythemia is common in those with chronic hypoxia.</br>Although the risk of increased morbidity and mortality appears to increase with worsening sleep related hypoventilation, the specific relationship between sleep related hypoventilation and morbidity and mortality is not well defined.</br>Many patients respond to assisted ven- tilation, whereas hypercapnia may worsen with oxygen therapy alone. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Pulmonary parenchymal diseases are characterized by altered lung volumes (e.g., reduced functional residual capacity) and abnormal ventilation/perfusion relationships, which can result in hypercapnia and hypoxemia during wakefulness.</br>Decreased lung volume is associated with reduced oxygen reserves that increase the risk of hypoxemia.</br>In addition, sleep may be associated with an altered pattern of ventilatory-muscle acti- vation, particularly during REM sleep when, due to reduced activation of the intercos- tal and accessory muscles, there is a disproportionate ventilatory burden placed on the diaphragm.</br>This may lead to hypoventilation in patients with chest wall abnormalities or in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</br>In the latter, lung hyperinfla- tion creates a mechanical disadvantage to the diaphragm.</br>Many neurologic and neu- romuscular disorders are associated with impaired respiratory mechanics and reduced CO2 chemosensitivity.</br>Finally, daytime hypoxemia, if sufficiently severe, may place the patient near or on the steep portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, where even relatively small decrements in arterial oxygen tension result in large decrements in oxyhemoglobin saturation.</br>Thus, sleep related hypoventilation in these patients may have a relatively great impact on oxyhemoglobin saturation. </br>Objective Findings The characteristic polysomnographic finding is demonstration of sleep related hypoven- tilation (by arterial PaCO2, transcutaneous PCO2, or end-tidal PCO2).</br>Sustained oxygen desaturation during sleep that is unexplained by discrete apnea and hypopnea events is common but is not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of sleep related hypoventilation.</br>Intermittent arousals associated with hypoxemia may be observed.</br>Many medical and neurologic disorders are associated with significant sleep disturbances and changes in sleep architecture, including prolonged sleep onset latency, reduced sleep efficiency, and decreased sleep stages N3 and REM, may be present.</br>Obstructive and central apneas, when present, will further disturb sleep and accentuate sleep related oxyhe- moglobin desaturation.</br>Daytime arterial blood gases may be normal or show hypoxia and hypercapnia.</br>Chronic hypoxia (especially when present during the day as well as at night) can be associated with polycythemia.</br>Electrocardiography, chest radiography, and echocardiography may demonstrate evidence of pulmonary hypertension. </br>In patients with neuromuscular weakness or restrictive chest wall disorders spirometry shows a restrictive ventilatory dysfunction with the forced vital capacity (FVC) often Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders less than 50% of predicted.</br>However, significant nocturnal desaturation can occur with FVC values greater than 50% of predicted. </br>Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis includes all disorders which can give rise to hypoventila- tion during sleep.</br>This includes OHS, use of medications or substances that can sup- press respiratory drive, and congenital or idiopathic central alveolar hypoventilation syndromes.</br>OSA and CSA can be distinguished from sleep related hypoventilation by the periodic alterations in airflow and accompanying periodic fluctuations in SaO2.</br>In contrast, oxygen desaturation due to sleep related hypoventilation is generally more sustained, usually several minutes or longer in duration.</br>When more than one disorder is believed to be responsible for the ventilatory insufficiency during sleep, all pertinent diagnoses should be coded. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Thresholds of impairments of ventilation and respiratory drive producing hypercapnia/ hypoxemia need to be identified.</br>The degree and duration of hypercapnia/hypoxemia necessary to produce adverse consequences, such as pulmonary hypertension, in indi- vidual patients is not well defined.</br>The value of routinely measuring PaCO2 during sleep in these patients is not clear.</br>Additionally, because it is clinically impractical to routinely obtain arterial blood samples during sleep in most persons suspected of this disorder, other techniques of measuring CO2 levels must be investigated.</br>Little infor- mation is available regarding the effect of oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation on the course of the underlying disease.</br>Studies are needed to determine the optimal time to initiate these interventions and the specific subpopulations of patients who will benefit most from these therapies. </br>Bibliography Ambrosino N, Carpenè N, Gherardi

Physiological causes, if known, should be indicated (e.g., shunt, ventilation-perfusion [V/Q] mismatch, low mixed venous oxygen, and/ or high altitude). </br>Essential Features Significant hypoxemia during sleep is present and is believed to be secondary to a medical or neurological disorder.</br>The presence of hypoxemia is not better explained by another sleep related breathing disorder (e.g., OSA).</br>Although some amount of obstructive or central apnea may be present, these disorders are not thought to be pri- marily responsible for the hypoxemia during sleep.</br>Some patients with sleep related hypoxemia also exhibit hypoxemia during wakefulness.</br>Sleep related hypoventilation has not been documented (if so, a diagnosis of sleep related hypoventilation is made).</br>The presentation of patients with sleep related hypoxemia varies with the underly- ing medical or neurological disorders.</br>Chronic hypoxemia can arise from airway or parenchymal pulmonary disease, chest wall disorders, pulmonary hypertension, or neurologic and neuromuscular disorders.</br>Acute exacerbations of respiratory disorders can accentuate the severity of hypoxemia.</br>Hypoxemia due to underlying lower airway obstructive disease, pulmonary parenchymal disease, vascular pathology, and other causes of hypoventilation is generally sustained (several minutes or longer), whereas sawtooth fluctuations of oxygen saturation (typically less than one minute) characterize hypoxemia due to OSA or CSA.</br>Patients can either be asymptomatic or present with complaints of nocturnal dyspnea, impaired sleep quality, chest tightness, or fatigue.</br>Polycythemia is often noted with severe chronic hypoxemia. </br>Associated Features Consequences of chronic hypercapnia and hypoxemia include pulmonary artery hyper- tension, cor pulmonale, and neurocognitive dysfunction.</br>Some of the disorders causing hypoxemia are prevalent diseases and not uncommonly overlap.</br>Patients with multi- ple breathing disorders are likely to experience greater severity and duration of sleep related hypoxemia than are patients with a single disorder. </br>Clinical and Pathologic Subtypes Specific variations in the sleep related findings have not been described for the various etiologies. </br>Demographics The demographics of sleep related hypoxemia are a function of the prevalence, clinical characteristics and degree of severity of the underlying conditions.</br>Thus, prevalence may be higher in patients with greater perturbations of pulmonary function or neu- romuscular weakness.</br>Individuals with chronic hypoxemia during wakefulness will experience even greater decrements of oxygenation during sleep. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors </br>Greater impairments of respiratory function are associated with greater risk for sleep related hypoxemia.</br>However, there is no recognized threshold of pulmonary paren- chymal or vascular disease severity or extent of neuromuscular weakness that ade-</br>quately predicts the risk of sleep related hypoxemia in individual patients.</br>Patients who are hypoxemic during wakefulness will generally become even more so during sleep, especially REM sleep.</br>Among the best predictors of sleep related hypoxemia are reduced baseline wake SaO2 and hypercapnia.</br>Patients with wake hypercapnia should be suspected of sleep related hypoxemia.</br>However, the relationship between wake SaO2/PaCO2 and sleep related desaturation is not sufficiently strong to have substantial predictive value in individual patients. </br>135 Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Familial Patterns Genetic patterns for many of the disorders are not known.</br>Alpha-1 antitrypsin defi- ciency is a genetic disorder characterized by defective production of the enzyme inhib- itor; severe forms of deficiency can lead to emphysema.</br>Genetic causes of bronchiec- tasis include primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis.</br>Muscular dystrophies are genetically inherited.</br>The familial patterns of sleep related hypoxemia due to these disorders reflect those of the underlying inherited conditions. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Onset and course of sleep related hypoxemia parallel the presence and severity of the underlying medical or neurological disorders that impair respiration, although sub- stantial variability in course is observed even within the same underlying condition.</br>Many affected individuals with severe hypercapnia and hypoxemia develop respiratory impairment, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and neuro- cognitive dysfunction.</br>Polycythemia is common in those with chronic hypoxia.</br>Higher rates of painful crises accompany hypoxemia in children with sickle cell disease.</br>Although the risk of increased morbidity and mortality appears to increase with wors- ening sleep related hypoxemia, the specific relationship between sleep related hypox- emia and morbidity and mortality is not well defined.</br>Many patients respond to oxygen therapy; in some, hypercapnia may worsen with oxygen therapy alone for hypoxia. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Hypoxemia may arise from a shunt physiology, ventilation-perfusion [V/Q] mismatch- ing, low mixed venous oxygen, and/or high altitude.</br>Hypoventilation also gives rise to hypoxemia; however, when hypoventilation has been documented, a diagnosis of sleep related hypoventilation should be assigned, rather than sleep related hypoxemia.</br>Pulmonary parenchymal diseases are characterized by altered lung volumes (e.g., reduced functional residual capacity) and abnormal ventilation/perfusion relationships, which can result in hypercapnia and hypoxemia during wakefulness.</br>Decreased lung volume is associated with reduced oxygen reserves that increase the risk of hypoxemia.</br>In addition, sleep may be associated with an altered pattern of ventilatory muscle acti- vation, particularly during REM sleep when, due to reduced activation of the intercos- tal and accessory muscles, there is a disproportionate ventilatory burden placed on the diaphragm.</br>This may lead to hypoventilation in patients with chest wall abnormalities or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</br>In the latter, lung hyperinflation creates a mechanical disadvantage to the diaphragm.</br>In sickle cell anemia, decreased oxyhemo- globin affinity may partly contribute to hypoxemia.</br>Many neurologic and neuromuscu- lar disorders are associated with impaired respiratory mechanics and reduced CO2 che- mosensitivity.</br>Finally, daytime hypoxemia, if sufficiently severe, may place the patient near or on the steep portion of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve where even rela- tively small decrements in arterial oxygen tension result in large decrements in oxyhe- moglobin saturation.</br>Thus, sleep related hypoventilation in these patients might have a relatively great impact on oxyhemoglobin saturation. </br>Objective Findings Various patterns of oxygen desaturation (sustained, intermittent, or episodic) may be observed during sleep.</br>The diagnosis is generally made on the basis of overnight oxim- etry (alone or as a component of PSG or OCST); less commonly, arterial blood gas mea- surements are indicated, especially if concomitant hypoventilation is suspected.</br>PSG may demonstrate normal sleep architecture or frequent arousals, increased wakeful- ness after sleep onset and reduced sleep efficiency; however, the contribution of sleep related hypoxemia to the altered sleep architecture, if present, is uncertain.</br>Daytime arterial blood gases may be normal or show hypoxia and hypercapnia.</br>Nocturnal oxim- etry usually shows sustained periods of reduced arterial oxygen but clusters of more severe drops in the arterial oxygen saturation can occur every one to two hours due to worsening of breathing during REM sleep.</br>A sawtooth pattern of briefer desaturations (typically less than one minute) suggests the presence of discrete events (apneas or hypopneas).</br>Some sawtooth changes may be superimposed on low baseline oxygen saturation but are not the predominant pattern.</br>Chronic hypoxia can be associated with polycythemia.</br>Electrocardiography, chest radiography, and echocardiography may demonstrate evidence of pulmonary hypertension. </br>Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis encompasses all disorders which can give to hypoxemia during sleep.</br>This includes pulmonary airway and parenchymal disorders, pulmonary vascular pathology, neuromuscular and chest wall disorders, OHS, use of medications or substances that can suppress respiratory drive, and congenital or idiopathic central alveolar hypoventilation syndromes.</br>OSA and CSA syndromes can be distinguished from sleep related hypoxemia by the periodic alterations in airflow and accompanying periodic fluctuations in SaO2.</br>In contrast, oxygen desaturation associated with sleep related hypoxemia is generally more sustained, usually several minutes or longer in duration.</br>In cases when more than one disorder is believed to be responsible for the ventilatory insufficiency during sleep, all pertinent diagnoses should be coded. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions The degree and duration of hypercapnia/hypoxemia necessary to produce adverse consequences, such as pulmonary hypertension, in individual patients is not well defined.</br>The value of routinely measuring arterial blood gases or SaO2 during sleep Sleep Related Breathing Disorders Sleep Related Breathing Disorders is not clear.</br>With the exception of COPD, little information is available regarding the effect of oxygen therapy on the course of the underlying disease.</br>Even less is under- stood regarding the consequences of isolated sleep related hypoxemia and the need for oxygen supplementation in patients with normal daytime wake oxygen levels.</br>Studies are needed to determine the optimal time to initiate oxygen therapy and the specific subpopulations of patients who will benefit most from this intervention. </br>Bibliography Berry RB, Sriram P.

..............................................................................................187 Adequate alertness is necessary for well-being and performance in modern society.</br>Sleepiness predisposes an individual to developing serious performance decrements in multiple areas of function, as well as to potentially life-threatening domestic, occu- pational, and vehicular accidents.</br>This section includes a group of disorders in which the primary complaint is daytime sleepiness not caused by disturbed nocturnal sleep or misaligned circadian rhythms.</br>Other sleep disorders may be present, but they must be adequately treated before a diagnosis in this category can be established.</br>In this nosology, the term hypersomnolence is used to describe the symptom of exces- sive sleepiness, whereas hypersomnia refers to specific disorders, such as idiopathic hypersomnia. </br>Daytime sleepiness is defined as the inability to stay awake and alert during the major waking episodes of the day, resulting in periods of irrepressible need for sleep or unin- tended lapses into drowsiness or sleep.</br>Sleepiness may vary in severity and is more likely to occur in sedentary, boring, and monotonous situations that require little active participation.</br>Some patients are aware of increasing sleepiness before falling asleep, whereas others can fall asleep with little or no prodromal symptoms (“sleep attacks”).</br>This group of patients sometimes can present following motor vehicle accidents attrib- utable to sleepiness.</br>In some forms of hypersomnolence, sleepiness is associated with large increases in total daily amount of sleep without any genuine feeling of resto- ration.</br>In others, sleepiness can be alleviated temporarily by naps but reoccurs shortly thereafter.</br>In young children, sleepiness may express itself as excessively long night sleep or with the recurrence of previously discontinued daytime napping.</br>Children may Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence paradoxically present with inattentiveness, emotional lability, hyperactive behavior, or decreased performance in school.</br>In most cases, excessive sleepiness is a chronic symptom.</br>It must occur for at least three months prior to diagnosis. </br>The severity of daytime sleepiness can be quantified subjectively using severity scales such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and objectively using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT).</br>These measures do not always correlate with each other and must be used with appropriate clinical judgment.</br>When applied in clinical settings, the MSLT is sensitive to sleep deprivation and circadian effects.</br>It has not been validated as a diagnostic test in people who are habitually awake throughout the night and sleep during the day.</br>Normal and abnormal ranges of sleep latencies have not been estab- lished when this test is administered at times other than the hours between 8:00 a.m. and</br>6:00 p.m. Normative data are not available for children younger than six years. </br>The MSLT measures the physiological tendency to fall asleep in quiet situations.</br>In the context of diagnosing central disorders of hypersomnolence, the MSLT should be con- ducted according to standardized procedures, as defined in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) practice parameters.</br>In particular, patients should be encour- aged to sleep as much as possible during the week and, especially, during the night prior to the MSLT.</br>Delaying wake-up time and subsequent MSLT start time may be appropriate in some patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome.</br>It is strongly rec- ommended that adequate sleep be documented by sleep log and, whenever possible, actigraphy for a period of one to two weeks prior to the MSLT.</br>MSLT mean sleep latencies should be considered a continuum with values below five minutes generally considered as indicative of sleepiness and those over 10 minutes generally consid- ered indicative of normal alertness.</br>In this section, a mean MSLT sleep latency of less than eight minutes is used to define sleepiness for diagnostic purposes.</br>This value has been shown to be the best cutoff in the context of diagnosing narcolepsy, with approximately 90% of patients with narcolepsy having a latency below this level.</br>The presence of multiple sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) during the MSLT is a more specific finding in narcolepsy than is a mean sleep latency less than or equal to eight minutes, although SOREMPs can also be seen in the presence of insuffi- cient sleep, circadian rhythm disorders (including delayed sleep phase disorder or shift work), sleep related breathing disorders or, occasionally, normal subjects.</br>The results of an MSLT should be carefully interpreted in the context of the patient’s history and the complaint of daytime sleepiness. </br>144 The maintenance of wakefulness test is a measure of the ability to remain awake during the daytime in a darkened, quiet environment and is usually administered to assess response to treatment.</br>It should not be used for diagnostic purposes. </br>A 24-hour continuous sleep recording or an actigraphic recording of at least one week is useful in the diagnosis of some patients with idiopathic hypersomnia.</br>In all cases in which a diagnosis of hypersomnolence is to be made, a review of other sleep, medical, and psychiatric disorders, as well as substance and medication use, should be performed. </br>In this edition of International Classification of Sleep Disorders the preferred names of certain central disorders of hypersomnolence have been changed.</br>In particular, nar- colepsy has been divided into narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2 rather than narcolepsy with and without cataplexy.</br>This change is predicated on the concept that absence of hypocretin (orexin) is a fundamental marker of the most precisely defined category of the disorder.</br>Because some patients without cataplexy will also have low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels, the use of the term “narcolepsy with cataplexy” or “narcolepsy-cataplexy” is inappropriate.</br>The change is not intended to imply that the presence or absence of cataplexy is unimportant clinically nor that mea- suring CSF hypocretin-1 levels is obligatory.</br>The motivation behind the decision to eliminate the subcategories of idiopathic hypersomnia is discussed in the appropriate section.</br>The decision to use

for example, watching television or riding in a car.</br>Physical activity may temporarily suppress the urge to sleep.</br>In some cases sleepiness manifests as sudden irresistible sleep “attacks” that may occur in unusual situations such as eating or walking.</br>Often, such sleep attacks occur on a background of overall sleepiness.</br>Even when seemingly awake, many nar- colepsy patients have lapses in vigilance, sometimes in combination with automatic behavior, such as writing gibberish or interrupting a conversation with a completely different topic.</br>Sleepiness generally has a serious impact on the ability of the patient to function in educational, social, and occupational situations. </br>Because patients are rarely examined during an attack of cataplexy, its presence needs to be established based on the clinical interview alone.</br>Cataplexy is defined as more than one episode of generally brief (&lt; 2 minutes), usually bilaterally symmetrical sudden loss of muscle tone with retained consciousness.</br>The episodes are precipitated by strong emotions, usually positive, with almost all patients reporting some episodes precipitated by emotions associated with laughter.</br>The finding of transient reversible loss of deep tendon reflexes during an attack, if observed, is a strong diagnostic finding.</br>In children (and rarely adults), cataplexy may present close to disease onset as facial (or generalized) hypotonia with droopy eyelids, mouth opening, and protruded tongue, or gait unsteadiness, which clearly are not related to emotion.</br>Facial and masticatory movements may occur.</br>In children, anticipation of a reward is a common precipitant.</br>It is important to use child-appropriate contexts and language when trying to elicit a history of cataplexy in children. </br>The cataplexy phenotype differs widely between patients, ranging from sporadic partial attacks triggered by laughter, to frequent complete attacks of collapse brought about by a variety of emotions.</br>In the vast majority of attacks, cataplexy is bilateral, although patients sometimes report one side of the body to be more affected than the other.</br>Partial attacks can be very subtle and sometimes only recognized by experi- enced observers such as the patient’s partner.</br>Neck weakness, producing head drop, is a common complaint, whereas facial weakness may lead to sagging of the jaw and dysarthria.</br>Respiratory muscles are not involved although patients sometimes describe shortness of breath when symptomatic.</br>Attacks start abruptly and usually build up over several seconds, especially in attacks producing complete peripheral weakness and collapse.</br>Positive motor phenomena are not uncommon, with muscle twitching Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence or small jerks, particularly of the face.</br>Although many emotions can potentially lead to cataplexy, those associated with mirth are usually the most potent.</br>Laughing out loud, telling a joke, and making a witty remark are typical examples.</br>The frequency of cataplexy is variable, ranging from less than one attack per month to more than 20 attacks per day.</br>Cataplexy is generally short-lived, lasting a matter of seconds, with the vast majority of attacks lasting less than two minutes.</br>However, if a particular trigger continues, consecutive attacks may merge together to form what seems to be one long episode.</br>Sudden withdrawal of anticataplectic medication, especially

, can result in “status cataplecticus” in which long-lasting attacks happen virtually continuously. </br>Associated Features In addition to sleepiness and cataplexy, patients with narcolepsy type 1 often report several other symptoms, none of which are specific for the disorder.</br>Many patients report disruption of nocturnal sleep, which can sometimes be of major concern.</br>Although sleep onset is rarely a problem, an inability to maintain continuous sleep is very common.</br>33% to 80% of narcolepsy patients have hypnagogic hallucinations and/or sleep paralysis.</br>Hypnagogic hallucinations are defined as vivid dreamlike expe- riences occurring at the transition from wake to sleep.</br>Typically, hypnagogic halluci- nations have a multimodal or “holistic” character, often combining visual, auditory, and tactile phenomena.</br>Hypnopompic hallucinations are similar but occur at sleep to wake transitions.</br>Sleep paralysis describes the disturbing temporary inability to move voluntary muscles at sleep-wake transitions.</br>Despite being awake and conscious of the sleeping environment, it is impossible for subjects to move their limbs or even open their eyes.</br>The experience may last for several minutes and can be very distressing.</br>Other symptoms may include ptosis, blurred vision, and diplopia, presumably as a result of sleepiness. </br>Epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is a common symptom of narco- lepsy.</br>Around disease onset, an unexplained increase in body weight is often observed.</br>Obesity (defined as a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) occurs more than twice as often in narcoleptic populations as in control groups.</br>An increased frequency of several other sleep abnormalities has been described in narcolepsy, including sleep talking, periodic limb movements of sleep, sleep disordered breathing, and REM sleep behavior disor- der.</br>There is an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms, although there are con- flicting reports on how often these symptoms qualify as a clinical depression.</br>Recent studies point to a high level of anxiety disorders in patients with narcolepsy, with panic attacks or social phobias in about 20%.</br>More than half of patients report severe fatigue, which can be distinct from sleepiness. </br>148 Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Narcolepsy type 1 due to a medical condition:</br>This condition is primarily associated with central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including autoimmune or paraneoplastic disorders associated with anti-Ma2 or antiaquaporin4 antibodies, and tumors or other lesions of the hypothalamus.</br>In addition, undetectable hypocretin-1 levels have been reported in association with sleepiness after severe head trauma.</br>The condition must fulfill criteria for narcolepsy type 1 and be attributable to another medical disorder. </br>Narcolepsy without cataplexy with low CSF Hcrt-1 levels: Narcolepsy type 1 should be diagnosed, even in the absence of cataplexy, if diagnostic criteria A and B2 are fulfilled. </br>Demographics Narcolepsy with cataplexy occurs in 0.02% to 0.18% of the United States and western European populations.</br>A lower prevalence has been reported in Israel, whereas narco- lepsy with cataplexy may be slightly more common in Japan (0.16% to 0.18%).</br>Both sexes are affected, with a slight preponderance of males. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Several unproven precipitating factors have been suggested in case reports, including head trauma, sustained sleep deprivation, unspecified viral illness, and sudden changes in sleep-wake patterns.</br>Several studies have pointed to seasonal patterns in the onset of narcolepsy, which may point to a specific environmental trigger.</br>Recent studies have shown an increase in antibodies against beta-hemolytic streptococcus, which were strongest around onset of narcolepsy and decreased with disease duration, suggesting that streptococcal infections may constitute an environmental trigger.</br>There have been reports of narcolepsy type 1 occurring after vaccination against H1N1 associated influ- enza, but a definite causal association has not yet been established.</br>Tribbles homolog 2 antibodies, found in some patients with autoimmune uveitis, have been described in 14% to 26% of narcolepsy patients, but the significance is uncertain. </br>Familial Patterns At the genetic level, narcolepsy with cataplexy is closely associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes DR2/DRB1*1501 and DQB1*0602.</br>These two subtypes are always found together in whites and Asians, but in blacks, DQB1*0602 is more specifically associated with narcolepsy.</br>Almost all patients with cataplexy are positive for DQB1*0602, compared with 12% to 38% of the general population who have this HLA subtype.</br>Other subtypes also have less striking associations.</br>For example, DQB1*0301 is associated with increased susceptibility to narcolepsy, Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence whereas subtypes such as DQB1*0501 and DQB1*0601, are protective in the presence of DQB1*0602.</br>

 2 as well as the purinergic receptor P2Y11 genes. </br>There is a low prevalence of familial cases; the risk of narcolepsy type 1 in first-de- gree relatives of affected individuals is approximately 1% to 2%.</br>When compared to the population prevalence, this indicates a tenfold to fortyfold increase in risk.</br>This increased risk cannot be explained solely by HLA gene effects, suggesting the exis- tence of other genetic factors.</br>Multiplex families with more than two affected members are uncommon.</br>In most cases, normal CSF hypocretin levels have been found in these families, and the association with HLA DQB1*0602 is much weaker compared to spo- radic narcolepsy.</br>So far, only a single case of narcolepsy type 1 has been described in association with a preprohypocretin mutation. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Onset usually occurs after five years of age and most typically between ages 10 and 25 years.</br>However, a bimodal distribution in the age at onset has been described in some populations with a first peak occurring at adolescence (age 15 years) and a second at the age of 35 years.</br>Recent studies highlight the fact that narcolepsy, and especially cataplexy, in young children may present somewhat differently, resulting in delayed diagnosis and erroneously high estimates of age of onset. </br>Sleepiness is usually the first symptom to manifest.</br>Cataplexy most often occurs within one year of onset but in rare cases, may precede the onset of sleepiness or commence up to 40 years later.</br>Hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, and disturbed noctur- nal sleep often manifest later in the course of the disease. </br>When left untreated, narcolepsy type 1 is often socially disabling and isolating.</br>Patients have a tendency to fail in school and are often dismissed from their jobs.</br>Driving may be avoided for fear of a motor vehicle accident.</br>The inability to sleep at night may further contribute to a loss of control these patients have over their schedule.</br>Depression and weight gain also are common. </br>In most cases, symptoms gradually develop over several years.</br>When the clinical picture has fully developed, there are usually only minor fluctuations in severity.</br>Cataplexy may lessen with age, or occasionally increase in frequency and severity. </br>150 Developmental Issues In recent years, increasing attention has been given to the clinical presentation of nar- colepsy in childhood.</br>Narcolepsy with cataplexy is infrequent prior to the age of four years.</br>In addition, the clinical presentation in children may be different from that of adults.</br>In young children, sleepiness may be difficult to assess, and may express itself as excessively long night sleep, or the recurrence of previously discontinued daytime napping.</br>Moreover, children may paradoxically present with hyperactive behavior, behavioral problems or decreased performance in school.</br>Inattentiveness, lack of energy, insomnia, bizarre hallucinations, or a combination thereof can lead to a psy- chiatric misdiagnosis of schizophrenia or depression.</br>In this population, the presence of ancillary symptoms such as sleep paralysis or hypnagogic hallucinations may also be difficult to confirm, depending on the child’s verbal ability.</br>Precocious puberty and obesity may also develop around the time of symptom onset.</br>REM sleep behavior dis- order or REM sleep without atonia may also be manifest at the time of symptom onset. </br>Cataplexy may be very severe around disease onset and appear phenotypically differ- ent from typical episodes seen in adulthood.</br>In addition to typical attacks triggered by positive emotions, children can also present with weakness involving the face, eyelids, and mouth not clearly associated with emotion.</br>Together with tongue protrusion, this characteristic pattern has been termed a cataplectic facies.</br>Children with cataplexy may also display positive motor phenomena, ranging from perioral dyskinetic or dys- tonic movements to frank stereotypies.</br>In children, anticipation of reward may also be a precipitant. </br>The diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1 in children may be complicated because of diffi- culties performing the MSLT, and lack of normative values in children younger than six years.</br>If the MSLT shows equivocal results, repeating it after a time interval may be helpful.</br>Given these difficulties, CSF hypocretin-1 measurements are of particular value, as hypocretin-1 levels are low or undetectable very shortly after disease onset in children as well. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology It is now firmly established that narcolepsy type 1 is caused by deficiencies in hypo- cretin signaling, most likely due to a selective loss of hypothalamic hypocretin pro- ducing neurons.</br>Several animal models lacking hypocretin neurotransmission demon- strate narcolepsy, indicating a causal relationship.</br>The vast majority of patients (90% to 95%) with narcolepsy and cataplexy have undetectable or low (&lt; 110 pg/mL) levels of hypocretin-1 in the CSF.</br>Patients without cataplexy can be hypocretin deficient as well, although at a much lower frequency, and are thus also classified as narcolepsy Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence type 1.</br>The strong HLA association in narcolepsy has led to the hypothesis that auto- immunity is a likely etiological mechanism, potentially explaining the selectivity of neuronal destruction in the hypothalamus.</br>However, definitive proof for autoimmunity has not been obtained. </br>Objective Findings Narcolepsy type 1 is essentially defined as a hypocretin deficiency syndrome, which is reflected in the need for objective measurements in the clinical criteria.</br>This require- ment is further driven by the fact that many patients require lifelong treatment with potentially addictive medications, underscoring the importance of objective confirma- tion of the diagnosis. </br>It is strongly recommended that the MSLT be preceded by at least one week of acti- graphic recording with a sleep log to establish whether the results could be biased by insufficient sleep, shift work, or another circadian sleep disorder.</br>In patients with narcolepsy type 1, the MSLT demonstrates a mean sleep latency of less than eight minutes and typically less than five minutes.</br>Meta-analysis shows mean sleep latencies in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy of 3.1 ± 2.9 minutes.</br>In addition, two or more SOREMPs must be present.</br>Recent data suggest that a SOREMP within 15 minutes of onset of nocturnal sleep is a highly specific finding in the absence of another sleep disorder, but with low sensitivity.</br>Therefore, the criteria for narcolepsy type 1 allow the “replacement” of one SOREMP in the MSLT with a SOREMP on the preceding poly- somnogram.</br>For the correct interpretation of MSLT findings, the recordings should be performed with the following conditions: (1) the patient must be free of drugs that influence sleep for at least 14 days (or at least five times the half-life of the drug and longer-acting metabolite), confirmed by a urine drug screen; (2) the sleep-wake sched- ule must have been standardized and, if necessary, extended to a minimum of seven hours in bed each night (longer for children) for at least seven days before polysom-</br>nography (preferably documented by sleep log and, whenever possible, actigraphy); and (3) nocturnal polysomnography should be performed on the night immediately preceding the MSLT to rule out other sleep disorders that could mimic the diagnostic features of narcolepsy type 1.</br>Sleep time during polysomnography should be curtailed as little as possible with the goal of at least seven hours asleep.</br>The overnight poly- somnogram may demonstrate an increase in the amount of stage N1 sleep, and there may be a disruption of the normal sleep pattern, with frequent awakenings.</br>REM sleep without atonia may be present. </br>Measuring CSF levels of hypocretin-1 is a highly specific and sensitive test for the diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1. Hypocretin-1 can be measured in crude CSF, using a commercially available radioimmunoassay.</br>When using the Stanford reference sample, values less than 110 pg/mL are highly specific.</br>Alternatively, a laboratory may elect to obtain control data themselves, in which case a level of less than 33% of mean control values is considered abnormal.</br>Issues concerning the standardization of CSF hypocre- tin measurements remain, but extensive protocols are available.</br>Low CSF hypocre- tin values are occasionally observed in seriously ill patients with other disorders and should be interpreted within the clinical context. </br>HLA typing of narcoleptic patients with cataplexy almost always shows the presence of HLA DQB1*0602 (and DR2 or DRB1*1501 in whites and Asians), but this is not diagnostic for narcolepsy.</br>Approximately 25% of the normal Caucasian population, 12% of the Japanese population, and 38% of the black population are positive for DQB1*0602.</br>HLA typing could be considered when a spinal tap is contemplated to assess hypocretin-1 values: if the patient is HLA-negative, hypocretin-1 levels are most likely normal. </br>Differential Diagnosis In the absence of cataplexy, narcolepsy type 1 can be diagnosed based on the pres- ence of hypersomnolence and low CSF hypocretin-1 levels.</br>When cataplexy is absent and CSF hypocretin-1 levels are normal or unknown, narcolepsy type 2 should be diagnosed. </br>Cataplexy must be differentiated from cataplexy-like episodes that are occasionally observed in normal individuals.</br>For example, feelings of muscle weakness are some- times reported when healthy subjects laugh out loud.</br>In genuine cataplexy, episodes most often occur with a significant frequency, and are associated with loss of muscle tone.</br>Cataplexy should be differentiated from hypotension, transient ischemic attacks, drop attacks, akinetic seizures, neuromuscular disorders, vestibular disorders, psycho- logical or psychiatric disorders, and sleep paralysis.</br>Clear improvement with antide- pressant medications may favor a diagnosis of cataplexy in difficult cases. </br>Sleepiness may be secondary to obstructive sleep apnea, insufficient sleep syndrome, shift work, the effects of substances or medications, or other sleep disorders.</br>Many of these conditions can result in early onset REM sleep as well.</br>When cataplexy is present, these disorders do not preclude a diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1.</br>When there is a questionable history of cataplexy in such cases, either comorbid conditions should be adequately treated before performing an MSLT or CSF hypocretin-1 should be measured. </br>153 Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Idiopathic hypersomnia is differentiated from narcolepsy type 1 by the absence of cat- aplexy and the lack of two or more SOREMPs on the MSLT.</br>In contrast with patients who have narcolepsy, patients with idiopathic hypersomnia generally have high sleep efficiency, sleep drunkenness, and long, unrefreshing naps. </br>In insufficient sleep syndrome, there is no cataplexy, and normalizing sleep time elim-</br>inates the daytime sleepiness.</br>Chronic fatigue syndrome and depression may mimic narcolepsy but do not show the typical MSLT findings.</br>Malingering and substance abuse disorder should be considered in patients who try to mislead the clinician in order to obtain

. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Ten percent of patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy have normal hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF, which suggests that CSF levels either do not perfectly reflect brain hypocretin neurotransmission or that narcolepsy with cataplexy can be caused by factors other than hypocretin deficiency.</br>The cause of the hypocretin cell destruction remains unknown, although an autoimmune-mediated mechanism is suspected.</br>Levels of hypocretin-1 have been reported in the blood of some subjects.</br>The development of serum tests to determine hypocretin deficiency would provide a less invasive diagnos- tic approach. </br>Bibliography Andlauer O, Moore H, Jouhier L, et al.</br>Nocturnal REM sleep latency for identifying patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency.</br>JAMA Neurol 2013;6:1–12. </br>Aran A, Einen M, Lin L, Palazzi G, Nishino S, Mignot E.

 antibodies, multiple sclerosis, myotonic dystrophy, Prader-Willi syndrome, Parkinson disease, and head trauma.</br>In disorders associated with both sleep apnea and narco- lepsy type 2, such as myotonic dystrophy or Prader-Willi syndrome, a diagnosis of narcolepsy type 2 should only be made if abnormal MSLT findings persist after the sleep apnea is adequately treated.</br>In all cases, especially with complex problems such as head trauma, clinical judgment should be used to determine if the development of narcolepsy was a mere coincidence or was triggered by the event or disorder. </br>156 Demographics The exact prevalence of narcolepsy type 2 is uncertain.</br>Cases of narcolepsy without cat- aplexy represent 15% to 25% of the clinic narcoleptic population.</br>A population-based study suggested a higher percentage (36%), corresponding to a point prevalence of 20.5/100,000.</br>Population-based studies have shown that approximately 4% to 9.5% of adults may have multiple SOREMPs during random MSLTs, but shift workers and subjects with sleep deprivation or sleep apnea were included in the studies.</br>Although both sexes can be affected, the prevalence may be slightly higher in men.</br>The age of onset mirrors that of narcolepsy type 1. Predisposing and Precipitating Factors As discussed below, about 24% of patients with narcolepsy but no cataplexy will have low CSF Hcrt-1 levels and almost all of these will be positive for the HLA DQB1*0602 antigen.</br>These patients probably share a common pathogenesis with narcolepsy with cataplexy and should be classified as narcolepsy type 1.</br>Underlying genetic and envi- ronmental factors associated with other patients with narcolepsy type 2 are unknown.</br>Environmental precipitating factors are suspected from case reports but have never been proven to trigger narcolepsy without cataplexy.</br>Among the most commonly reported triggers are head trauma and unspecified viral illnesses. </br>Familial Patterns The detailed genetic pattern of narcolepsy type 2 is unknown.</br>Relatives of patients with narcolepsy type 1 may be more likely to experience partial narcolepsy symptoms compatible with the diagnosis of narcolepsy type 2. Onset, Course, and Complications Onset typically occurs during adolescence.</br>In about 10% of patients, cataplexy will develop later in the course of the disease, necessitating a change in diagnosis to narco- lepsy type 1.</br>Most of these patients will, if tested, have absent or intermediate levels of CSF Hcrt-1.</br>In a cohort of patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy in whom CSF Hcrt-1 status was known, 33% of those with low levels later developed cataplexy, compared with 18% with intermediate levels and only 1% with normal levels.</br>When left untreated, narcolepsy type 2 is socially disabling and isolating.</br>Patients have a ten- dency to fail in school and are often dismissed from their jobs.</br>Driving may be avoided for fear of a motor vehicle accident.</br>The inability to sleep at night may further contrib- ute to a loss of control these patients have over their schedule.</br>Depression and weight gain also are common. </br>157 Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Developmental Issues Children with narcolepsy type 2 will typically present with a reappearance of regular daytime napping after naps had been discontinued.</br>In all pediatric cases, one should consider the possibility of an evolving disorder with the development of cataplexy over time.</br>Once the patient develops clear cataplexy, the diagnosis should be changed to narcolepsy type 1.</br>Limited information is available on narcolepsy type 2 prior to adolescence.</br>Descriptions of the experience of sleep paralysis or hypnagogic halluci- nations are very difficult to evoke in young patients, and normative data are not avail- able for the MSLT in children younger than six years of age.</br>In peripubertal children and adolescents, the diagnosis is often challenging.</br>The most common causes of short sleep latencies, often with multiple

 on the MSLT, are chronic sleep depri- vation and delayed sleep phase disorder.</br>Behavioral problems may be associated with the onset of the disorder, and symptoms may be hidden by the patient.</br>Inattentiveness, lack of energy, insomnia, bizarre hallucinations, or a combination thereof can lead to a psychiatric misdiagnosis of schizophrenia or depression.</br>If the MSLT shows equivocal results, repeating it after a time interval may be helpful, as SOREMPs often emerge later in children. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Narcolepsy type 2 is most likely a heterogeneous disorder.</br>Approximately 24% of nar-</br>coleptic patients without cataplexy have a low CSF Hcrt-1 concentration, and another 8% have intermediate levels (&gt; 110 pg/mL but ≤ 200 pg/mL).</br>The CSF Hcrt-1 status of most patients with narcolepsy type 2 is unknown (those patients who are known to have absent CSF Hcrt-1 levels are classified as narcolepsy type 1).</br>Therefore, there will be a subgroup of about one fourth to one third of narcolepsy type 2 patients who will have hypocretin deficiency, presumably from loss of the hypocretin-producing neurons.</br>This group of patients cannot be accurately separated clinically or by labora- tory tests (other than CSF Hcrt-1 level) from the majority of patients without cataplexy who have normal CSF Hcrt-1 levels.</br>Although those with low CSF Hcrt-1 levels have a younger age of onset and their MSLT shows shorter mean sleep latency with more SOREMPs in comparison with those with normal levels, there is too much overlap between the groups for these differences to be helpful diagnostically in individual patients.</br>One hundred percent of patients with low CSF Hcrt-1 levels are positive for HLA DQB1*0602.</br>About 26% of patients with normal levels are also HLA posi- tive, a percentage not higher than that seen in the normal population.</br>The underlying pathophysiology of the remainder of patients who have normal CSF Hcrt-1 levels is unknown.</br>It is possible some may have partial hypocretin deficiency severe enough to cause sleepiness but not severe enough to result in cataplexy or low CSF Hcrt-1 levels.</br>However, support for this hypothesis is lacking in that there are no major differences in clinical or polysomnographic findings in those positive or negative for HLA DQB1*0602.</br>In the only postmortem study of a case of narcolepsy without cata- plexy (CSF Hcrt-1 status unknown), the number of hypocretin cells was decreased but not as much as in cases of narcolepsy with cataplexy. </br>Objective Findings It is strongly rcommended that the MSLT be preceded by at least one week of acti- graphic recording with a sleep log to establish whether the results could be biased by insufficient sleep, shift work, or another circadian sleep disorder.</br>The MSLT demon- strates a mean latency of less than eight minutes, typically less than five minutes, with two or more

 or one SOREMP together with a SOREMP on the preceding polysomnogram.</br>Meta-analysis shows mean sleep latencies in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy of 3.1 ± 2.9 minutes.</br>Recent data suggest that a SOREMP within 15 minutes of onset of nocturnal sleep is a highly specific finding in the absence of another sleep disorder, but with low sensitivity.</br>Therefore, the criteria for narcolepsy type 2 allow the “replacement” of one SOREMP in the MSLT with a SOREMP on the preceding poly- somnogram.</br>For the correct interpretation of MSLT findings, the recordings should be performed with the following conditions: (1) the patient must be free of drugs that influence sleep for at least 14 days (or at least five times the half-life of the drug and longer-acting metabolite), confirmed by a urine drug screen; (2) the sleep-wake sched- ule must have been standardized and, if necessary, extended to a minimum of seven hours in bed each night (longer for children) for at least seven days before polysom-</br>nography (preferably documented by sleep log and, whenever possible, actigraphy); and (3) nocturnal polysomnography should be performed on the night immediately preceding the MSLT to rule out other sleep disorders that could mimic the diagnostic features of narcolepsy type 2.</br>Sleep time during polysomnography should be curtailed as little as possible, with the goal of at least seven hours asleep.</br>The overnight poly- somnogram may demonstrate an increase in the amount of stage N1 sleep, and there may be a disruption of the normal sleep pattern, with frequent awakenings.</br>REM sleep without atonia may be present. </br>About 45% of narcolepsy type 2 cases have been reported to be HLA DQB1*0602 positive, compared with 12% to 38% of controls.</br>Whereas essentially all patients who have low CSF Hcrt-1 levels will be positive, about 25% of those with normal levels will also be positive.</br>Assuming that 24% of patients with narcolepsy but no cataplexy will have low CSF Hcrt-1 levels, the probability that an HLA- positive patient will have low Hcrt-1 levels is only 0.56.</br>Therefore the HLA status of a patient cannot be used to diagnose narcolepsy type 2 nor to predict with high probability the patient’s CSF Hcrt-1 levels.</br>However, if lumbar puncture is contemplated to measure CSF Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Hcrt-1 levels, HLA typing should be performed first; if the patient is HLA negative, CSF Hcrt-1 levels will almost certainly be normal and the lumbar puncture will be unnecessary. </br>Approximately 24% of narcoleptic patients without cataplexy have a low CSF Hcrt-1 concentration and another 8% have intermediate levels (&gt; 110 pg/mL but ≤ 200 pg/ mL).</br>If the CSF Hcrt-1 levels of such patients are known to be low, they are classified as narcolepsy type 1, but the CSF Hcrt-1 status will not be known for most of these patients.</br>Possible indications for considering measuring CSF Hcrt-1 levels as a diag- nostic procedure would be the presence of disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea or the use of

10 hours show no differences in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores, MSLT mean sleep latencies, or percentage with sleep drunkenness, unrefreshing naps, hypnago- gic hallucinations, or sleep paralysis.</br>The only reported differences are that the group with long sleep is somewhat younger and thinner, with lower Horne-Ostberg scores and marginally higher sleep efficiency.</br>If MSLT mean sleep latencies are not used as a diagnostic criterion, the distribution of latencies is unimodal, suggesting no sepa- rate subtypes.</br>In addition, an actigraphy study has shown that patients with IH tend to overestimate their sleep time by a mean of 0.99 hours, thus making the fundamental criterion for distinguishing between patients with long and shorter sleep inaccurate.</br>Clinicians may wish to continue to note sleep duration as an important clinical feature, but the caveats discussed above should be clearly considered.</br>Any future separation of IH into distinct conditions must await advances in understanding the underlying biology. </br>Demographics Prevalence and incidence of IH are not known.</br>Some studies have suggested a higher prevalence in women. </br>163 Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Predisposing and Precipitating Factors In contrast to narcolepsy, the disorder is not known to be HLA associated, and no con- sistent precipitating factor has been identified. </br>Familial Patterns A familial predisposition to hypersomnia has been reported but rigorous studies have not been performed. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications The mean age of onset of IH in different series is 16.6–21.2 years.</br>Once established, the disorder is generally stable in severity and long lasting, although a spontaneous remission rate of 14% has been reported in one series.</br>Complications are mostly social and professional, and include poor work or school performance, reduced earnings, and loss of employment. </br>Developmental Issues IH frequently develops in adolescence.</br>Exclusion of other causes of hypersomno- lence in that age group, including delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, insufficient sleep syndrome, and use of recreational drugs, is essential.</br>Early in the development of narcolepsy, SOREMPs may not be present on MSLT; therefore, some patients may need to be reclassified later as narcolepsy type 2.</br>If the 24-hour total sleep time is used to confirm the diagnosis of IH in a child or adolescent, normal values may need to be adapted to account for changes in sleep time associated with stages of development. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of IH is unknown.</br>Neurochemical studies measuring monoamine metabolites in the CSF have been inconclusive.</br>CSF hypocretin-1 concentrations in patients with IH are normal.</br>CSF histamine levels have been reported to be low in patients with narcolepsy and IH, but a recent study did not confirm these findings. </br>Objective Findings Polysomnographic monitoring generally demonstrates NREM and REM sleep in expected proportions with normal REM latency.</br>Total sleep time is often prolonged.</br>Sleep apnea should be either absent or adequately treated before diagnosing this disor- der, with special attention paid to excluding significant respiratory effort related arous- als.</br>The MSLT should not show more than one SOREMP (or none if a SOREMP was observed on the preceding night’s polysomnogram (PSG)).</br>The mean sleep latency on the MSLT is usually shorter than in controls but longer than in most patients with nar- colepsy, averaging 8.3 and 7.8 minutes in two large studies. </br>In patients with MSLT mean latencies &gt;

Disinhibited behavior (such as hypersexuality). </br>E.</br>The hypersomnolence and related symptoms are not better explained by another sleep disorder, other medical, neurologic, or psychiatric disorder (especially bipolar disorder), or use of drugs or medications. </br>166 Essential Features Kleine-Levin syndrome is characterized by relapsing-remitting episodes of severe hypersomnolence in association with cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral distur- bances.</br>A typical episode lasts a median 10 days (range, 2.5–80 days), with rare epi- sodes lasting several weeks to months.</br>The first episode is often triggered by an infec- tion or alcohol intake, with further episodes recurring every 1–12 months (median three months) for years.</br>During episodes, patients may sleep as long as 16 to 20 hours per day, waking or getting up only to eat and void (incontinence is not observed).</br>They remain rousable, but are irritable if prevented from sleeping.</br>When they are awake during episodes, most patients are exhausted, apathetic, confused, and slow in speaking and answering.</br>Anterograde amnesia is typical.</br>Almost all report a dreamlike, altered perception of the environment (derealization).</br>Less commonly, patients eat ravenously (66%, although one third eat less), are hypersexual (53%, principally men), childish, depressed (53%, predominantly women), and anxious at being left alone and seeing strangers, and experience hallucinations and delusions (30%).</br>Patients are remark- ably normal between episodes with regard to sleep, cognition, mood, and eating.</br>The disease typically resolves after a median of 14 years, except in adult-onset cases, when the course may be more prolonged.</br>The simultaneous occurrence of all these symp- toms is the exception rather than the rule, with hypersomnolence being more char- acteristic at the disease onset and during the first part of the episodes, and disinhib- ited behaviors being evident during only a few episodes.</br>In occasional cases, isolated recurrent hypersomnolence may be the only symptom.</br>Amnesia, transient dysphoria, or elation with insomnia may signal the termination of an episode. </br>Associated Features Physical examination is unremarkable, except for general psychomotor slowing.</br>Social and occupational impairment during attacks is often severe, with teenagers bedridden for days, but can be variable depending on the frequency, severity, and duration of episodes. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Menstrual-related Kleine-Levin syndrome (alternate name: menstrual-related hyper- somnia):</br>This descriptor is used when episodes are exclusively associated with men- struation (occurring just before or during menses), a condition reported in only 18 women worldwide.</br>Hypersomnolence episodes in these cases have been associated with compulsive eating in 65%, sexual disinhibition in 29%, and depressive mood in 35%.</br>Episodes last 3 to 15 days and recur less than three times a year.</br>One boy with Kleine-Levin syndrome is reported to have a sister affected by menstrual-related hypersomnolence.</br>Menstrual-related hypersomnia may be a variant of Kleine-Levin Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence syndrome, although response to contraceptive doses of

, reported in some cases, suggests a reproductive endocrine disturbance. </br>Demographics Kleine-Levin syndrome is rare, with a prevalence estimated around 1 to 2 cases per million.</br>Roughly 500 cases have been reported to date in the literature, from all countries in which the disease has been investigated.</br>The disease starts during the second decade in 81% of patients, with a male/female ratio of 2:1.</br>Adults and younger children may also be affected. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Birth and developmental problems, as well as Jewish heritage, are risk factors for devel- oping the syndrome.</br>The frequency of the HLA DQB1*02 was increased compared with controls in a retrospective, multicenter series of 30 patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome, but not in another larger prospective series (n = 108).</br>A flu-like illness or an infection of the upper airway (and more rarely gastroenteritis) is often reported imme- diately prior to the onset of the first episode, and more rarely before relapses.</br>Other less frequently reported triggering events include alcohol consumption, head trauma, travel, or exposure to anesthesia. </br>Familial Patterns Familial cases of Kleine-Levin syndrome are found in 5% of patients, including twins, parent-child, siblings, and uncle-nephew associations.</br>There is no increased history of mood disorders in family members of patients. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Early adolescence (second decade) is the usual age of onset.</br>The course of Kleine-</br>Levin syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe sleepiness, lasting up to several weeks, with normal functioning between episodes.</br>Several long-term studies suggest an often-benign course, with episodes lessening in duration, severity, and fre- quency over a median course of 14 years.</br>Male sex, age at onset younger than 12 years or older than 20 years, as well as the presence of hypersexuality during episodes, predict longer disease duration.</br>Complications are mainly social and occupational.</br>In rare cases, subjects have been reported to choke while eating voraciously, to have suicidal thoughts, or to be involved in a car accident.</br>A reduced long-term working memory capacity following episodes was reported in eight patients with Kleine-Levin syndrome. </br>Developmental Issues Adolescents are affected in most cases.</br>However, the onset of the condition has been reported in children as young as four years. </br>168 Pathology and Pathophysiology Postmortem examination of the central nervous system has been performed in only four cases, with inconsistent findings.</br>One subject showed significant perivascular lymphocytic infiltrations in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and the grey matter of the temporal lobes; a second demonstrated similar infiltrations in the thalamus; and a third in the diencephalon and the midbrain with a suggestion of mild localized encephali- tis.</br>In the fourth case, a smaller locus coeruleus and decreased pigmentation in the substantia nigra were reported.</br>Magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable.</br>In contrast, functional brain imaging studies during episodes are frequently abnormal, showing hypometabolism in the thalamus, hypothalamus, mesial temporal lobe, and frontal lobe.</br>Some of these abnormalities persist during asymptomatic periods in half of the patients.</br>An autoimmune basis for the disorder is suggested clinically (onset occurs during adolescence, often in conjunction with an infection) and by the occa- sional association with HLA DQB1*02. </br>Objective Findings Routine electroencephalograms obtained during episodes have shown general slowing of background electroencephalographic activity and often paroxysmal—0.5-2.0-sec- ond—bursts of bisynchronous, generalized, moderate- to high-voltage 5- to 7-Hz waves.</br>Polysomnography studies are often difficult to interpret, and results are depen- dent on the duration of recording (overnight vs. 24-hour monitoring) as well as the timing (at the beginning versus the end of episodes or at onset of the disease or later in its course).</br>Twenty-four-hour polysomnography demonstrates prolonged total sleep time (a mean 11–12 hours), and 18 hours or more in some reports.</br>During nocturnal polysomnography in 17 children, nighttime slow wave sleep percentage was decreased during the first half of the episodes, and REM sleep decreased during the second half.</br>Results of the MSLT are highly dependent on the subjects’ willingness to comply with the procedure, and may either be normal or abnormal, showing short latencies or mul- tiple SOREMPs.</br>CSF cytology and protein are normal.</br>CSF levels of hypocretin-1 were within normal range in 16 patients, although intraepisodic levels are lower than interepisodic levels.</br>Computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging are normal.</br>Brain functional imaging is abnormal in most cases, with hypoperfusion of the left or right temporal and frontal lobes as well as the diencephalon.</br>These abnor- malities are present during the episode of hypersomnolence and sometimes between episodes.</br>Hormone levels are normal, as are 24-hour secretory patterns. </br>Differential Diagnosis Recurrent waxing and waning episodes of sleepiness may be secondary to struc- tural insults of the central nervous system.</br>Tumors within the third ventricle (such as Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence colloid cysts, pedunculated astrocytomas, or, in some cases, craniopharyngiomas) may produce intermittent obstructions of ventricular flow, leading to headaches, vomiting, vague sensorial disturbances, and a paroxysmal impairment of alertness.</br>Encephalitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, head trauma, porphyria, Lyme disease, basilar migraine, and complex partial status epilepticus less frequently mimic symptoms of Kleine-Levin syndrome.</br>Recurrent episodes of sleepiness also are reported in the context of psychiatric disorders, such as depression, bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder, and somatoform disorder.</br>However, the onset and offset of symptoms are less abrupt than in Kleine-Levin syndrome and persist to some extent between episodes.</br>Other differential diagnoses include excessive sleepiness due to a medication or substance, OSA, narcolepsy, IH, and insufficient sleep.</br>In these disor- ders, however, the complaint of excessive sleepiness occurs daily and is usually not recurrent or periodic.</br>There is no evidence that Kleine-Levin syndrome occurs as a result of a seizure disorder. </br>Unresolved Issues and Future Directions The pathophysiology of this disorder is not known.</br>Evidence to date suggests that a localized but multifocal encephalopathy occurs during episodes of Kleine-Levin syn- drome, as functional imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) slowing indicate tha- lamic, temporal, and frontal lobe involvement.</br>The cause of these episodic abnormali- ties may be genetic, autoimmune, inflammatory, or metabolic. </br>Bibliography Arnulf I, Lin L, Gadoth N, et al.</br>Kleine-Levin syndrome: a systematic study of 108 patients.</br>Ann Neurol 2008;63:482–93. </br>Arnulf I, Zeitzer JM, File J, Farber N,

The daytime sleepiness occurs in association with a concurrent psychiatric disorder. </br>C. The symptoms are not better explained by another untreated sleep disorder, a medical or neurological disorder, or the effects of medications or drugs. </br>Essential Features Patients with hypersomnia associated with a psychiatric disorder may report excessive nocturnal sleep, daytime sleepiness, or excessive napping.</br>In addition, they often feel their sleep is of poor quality and nonrestorative.</br>Patients are often intensely focused on their hypersomnolence, and psychiatric symptoms may become apparent only after prolonged interviews or psychometric testing.</br>Associated psychiatric conditions include mood disorders, conversion or undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and less frequently other mental disorders such as schizoaffective disorder, adjustment disor- der, or personality disorders. </br>Associated Features Poor work attendance, spending full days in bed several times a week, or abruptly leaving work because of a perceived need to sleep are common symptoms.</br>Patients may also have social withdrawal, apathy, and feelings of low energy. </br>Clinical and Pathological Subtypes Hypersomnia associated with mood disorder:</br>Hypersomnolence in the context of depression is a frequent feature of atypical depression and bipolar II disorder (recur- rent major depressive episodes with hypomanic episodes).</br>In seasonal affective disor- der, daytime fatigue, loss of concentration, increased appetite for carbohydrates, and weight gain are reported.</br>MSLT results are usually normal, but long hours spent in bed are reported. </br>Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Hypersomnia associated with a conversion disorder or somatic symptom disorder: Pseudohypersomnia or pseudonarcolepsy, sometimes with pseudocataplexy, has been described. </br>Demographics Hypersomnia associated with a psychiatric disorder accounts for 5% to 7% of hyper- somnolence cases.</br>Women are more susceptible than men, and the typical age range is between 20 and 50 years.</br>In patients with major depression, the prevalence of hypersom- nolence ranges from 5% to over 50% depending on how hypersomnolence is defined.</br>Hypersomnolence affects over 50% of patients with seasonal affective disorder. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Not applicable or known. </br>Familial Patterns Not known, except for the familial patterns of certain psychiatric disorders (e.g., bipolar II disorder). </br>Onset, Course, and Complications The mean age of onset is usually in the third decade in both sexes.</br>With major depres- sion, hypersomnolence may persist even after the depressive episode improves, and persistent hypersomnolence is associated with increased risk of recurrent depression.</br>Complications are mostly social and occupational. </br>Developmental Issues Hypersomnolence occurs in 10% to 20% of children with major depression, some- times in combination with insomnia, but sleep quality appears normal.</br>Although sleep problems may develop at any stage of depression, they are most pronounced during the acute phase.</br>Children and adolescents with depression who manifest either insomnia or hypersomnolence generally manifest more pronounced symptoms, such as anhedo- nia and weight loss. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The underlying cause is unknown.</br>Although patients with this disorder report sleep- iness, sleep studies reveal little or no evidence of increased propensity to sleep.</br>In some patients, fragmented nighttime sleep may contribute to their daytime sleepiness.</br>Because of uncertainty about the nature of the relationship, the term “hypersomnia associated with a psychiatric disorder” is preferred to “hypersomnia due to a psychi- atric disorder.” </br>180 Objective Findings Nocturnal polysomnography typically shows a prolonged total time in bed with frag- mented sleep.</br>Sleep latency is prolonged, wake time after sleep onset is increased, awakenings may be frequent and prolonged, and sleep efficiency is low.</br>REM sleep latency may be shortened in the case of untreated depression.</br>Sleep latencies on the MSLT are often within normal limits, a result contrasting with the subjective complaint of daytime sleepiness and an elevated score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.</br>24-hour continuous sleep-recording studies typically show considerable time spent in bed during day and night, a behavior sometime referred to as clinophilia.</br>Psychiatric inter- views and evaluations are essential to diagnose the underlying psychiatric condition. </br>Differential Diagnosis As there are no definitive tests for diagnosing hypersomnolence associated with a psy- chiatric disorder, it is essential to rule out other common causes of sleepiness such as insufficient sleep, sedation from medications or substances, SRBD, periodic limb movement disorder, and IH.</br>Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by persistent or relapsing fatigue that does not resolve with sleep or rest, but the main complaint is usually fatigue rather than sleepiness.</br>Insufficient sleep syndrome is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired concentration, and lowered energy level, but a detailed history of the subject’s current sleep schedule reveals chronic sleep deprivation. </br>Unresolved Issues and Future Directions The lack of concordance between subjective and objective findings raises multiple issues.</br>It is unclear to what extent these patients are objectively sleepy or, instead, suffer from decreased energy and lack of interest that confines them to bed.</br>More research is needed to create an effective definition of hypersomnolence in this population and to develop tools for measuring it.</br>Finally, future efforts should define the mechanism through which some patients express their psychiatric symptoms as excessive sleepiness. </br>Bibliography

 studies favor a polygenic origin of sleep duration, with influence of clock and other genes (DEC2, K+ channel regulatory pro- teins genes).</br>Long sleepers presumably represent the extreme high end of the normal sleep duration continuum. </br>Long sleepers, like short sleepers, have normal absolute amounts of stage N3 sleep, unless there is chronic sleep restriction preceding polysomnography, in which case the absolute amount of N3 stage is increased.</br>Amounts of stages N2 and REM sleep are somewhat higher than normal.</br>The individual has no problem with time distortion or ability to be accurate about the quantity or quality of sleep.</br>Assuming that individuals Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence have obtained their usual sleep amounts for several nights before the procedure, no sleepiness is evident on the MSLT.</br>It is important to differentiate the long sleeper from patients with narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, sleep disordered breathing, or medical causes of hypersomnolence.</br>Many pathologic causes of increased sleep have an acute or subacute onset, may not be present since childhood, and rarely show the stable course of the long sleeper.</br>Nevertheless, differentiation from pathologic con- ditions of hypersomnolence may be difficult in the child or adolescent because the normal continuum of sleep duration is somewhat higher in these age groups than in adults.</br>The correct determination is often made by exclusion of specific diagnostic features associated with other conditions and by the absence of complaints concerning the quality of the individual’s awake-state functioning when adequate sleep is obtained (e.g., during prolonged holidays).</br>In particular, the differentiation of a genuine long sleeper from a patient with idiopathic hypersomnia may be difficult.</br>In the genuine long sleeper, sleeping long hours is refreshing, and sleepiness disappears when long hours of nocturnal sleep are enforced. </br>Bibliography Aeschbach D, Cajochen C, Landolt H, Borbély AA.</br>Homeostatic sleep regulation in habitual short sleepers and long sleepers.</br>Am J Physiol 1996;270:R41–53.

..............................................209 Shift Work Disorder ....................................................................................</br>215 Jet Lag Disorder .........................................................................................220 Circadian Sleep-Wake Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) ..............224 Circadian rhythms are endogenous, near-24-hour biological rhythms that exist in all living organisms.</br>The internal near-24-hour circadian clock is entrained or synchro- nized to the 24-hour light-dark cycle.</br>In humans, the endogenous period of the circa- dian oscillation is genetically determined and typically is slightly longer than 24 hours.</br>In order to maintain entrainment, the endogenous rhythm must be reset each day to the 24-hour clock time.</br>For optimal sleep, the actual sleep time should match the timing of the circadian rhythm of sleep and wake propensity.</br>Therefore, a recurrent or chronic pattern of sleep and wake disturbance may result from disruption of the internal circa- dian timing system or a misalignment between the timing of the individual’s circadian sleep-wake propensity and the 24-hour social and physical environments (e.g., sleep episodes scheduled entirely or in part during a phase of circadian alertness promotion).</br>As used herein, a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder (CRSWD) is defined by the following criterion: The disorder is caused by alterations of the circadian time-keeping system, its entrainment mechanisms, or a misalignment of the endogenous circadian rhythm and the external environment. </br>Most CRSWDs arise when a substantial misalignment exists between the internal rhythm and the required timing of the patient’s school, work, or social activities.</br>Therefore, measurement of endogenous circadian timing is important for the accu- rate diagnosis of CRSWDs.</br>In addition to the history, multiple tools are available to assess sleep-wake patterns.</br>Sleep log and actigraphy are essential instruments in the evaluation of CRSWDs and should be conducted for at least seven days, preferably for 14 days, to capture work and non-work days.</br>Circadian chronotype (Morningness- Eveningness Questionnaires) and physiological measures of endogenous circadian timing (salivary or plasma dim light melatonin onset</br>and urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin) also can provide important diagnostic information.</br>Circadian chronotype is a reflec- tion of an individual’s optimal timing of sleep and wake propensity, as well as other Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders physiological and mental functions.</br>Several questionnaires can be used to assess chro- notype of “eveningness” or “morningness” (e.g., Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, or Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire). </br>The most common presenting symptoms of CRSWDs are difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, and excessive sleepiness, but their impact extends to adverse health outcomes, impairments in social, occupational and educational performance, and safety concerns.</br>Important advances have been made in the identification of clin- ical CRSWD subtypes, particularly in the area of pediatrics.</br>However, the challenge remains to develop more precise and clinically practical tools to improve diagnostic accuracy for CRSWDs. </br>General Criteria for Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorder </br>Criteria</br>A-C must be met A. A chronic or recurrent pattern of sleep-wake rhythm disruption primarily due to alteration of the endogenous circadian timing system or misalignment between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep-wake schedule desired or required by an individual’s physical environment or social/work schedules. </br>B. The circadian rhythm disruption leads to insomnia symptoms, excessive sleepiness, or both. </br>C.</br>The sleep and wake disturbances cause clinically significant distress or impairment in mental, physical, social, occupational, educational, or other important areas of functioning. </br>All disorders described in the ensuing section imply a sleep difficulty that meets each of the above criteria.</br>The specific features that characterize each type of CRSWD are included within the individual diagnostic criteria. </br>190 Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder ICD-9-CM code: 327.31 ICD-10-CM code: G47.21 Alternate Names Delayed sleep phase syndrome, delayed sleep phase pattern, motivated delayed sleep phase disorder. </br>Diagnostic Criteria Criteria A-E must be met A.</br>There is a significant delay in the phase of the major sleep episode in relation to the desired or required sleep time and wake-up time, as evidenced by a chronic or recurrent complaint by the patient or a caregiver of inability to fall asleep and difficulty awakening at a desired or required clock time. </br>B. The symptoms are present for at least three months. </br>C. When patients are allowed to choose their ad libitum schedule, they will exhibit improved sleep quality and duration for age and maintain a delayed phase of the 24-hour sleep-wake pattern. </br>D. Sleep log and, whenever possible, actigraphy monitoring for at least seven days (preferably 14 days) demonstrate a delay in the timing of the habitual sleep period.</br>Both work/school days and free days must be included within this monitoring. </br>E.</br>The sleep disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder. </br>Notes .</br>Standardized chronotype questionnaires are useful tools to assess the chronotype of eveningness and morningness.</br>Individuals with this disorder typically score as evening types.</br>This tool can also be useful in determining whether an eveningness circadian preference contributes to sleep initiation difficulties among those who do not meet full criteria for the disorder. </br>2.

, or stimulant substances to alleviate symptoms of insomnia and excessive sleepiness, thereby perpetuating their underlying sleep disorder. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Motivated delayed sleep-wake phase disorder is a subtype typically composed of ado- lescents who have little intrinsic motivation to successfully complete treatment and thereby resume a normal lifestyle (regular school attendance, developmentally appro- priate peer interactions, etc).</br>A history of mood or anxiety disorder (especially school phobia and separation and social anxiety) or other factors (e.g., learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) are often present and may motivate the patient (sometimes unconsciously) to avoid a return to normal adolescent activities, espe- cially regular school attendance.</br>It is not uncommon that ill-defined medical issues (e.g., chronic fatigue, recurrent mononucleosis episodes, pain syndromes) trigger the onset or complicate the course of the disorder.</br>Important clues, in addition to the exis- tence of premorbid mental disorders, include exaggerated presenting symptoms (e.g., “can’t wake up even if I throw cold water on him”) and failure to comply with basic straightforward treatment recommendations (e.g., refusal or inability to stop napping during the day). </br>192 Although social, psychological, and environmental factors may play a significant role in the development of delayed sleep-wake phase, International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition has chosen to list only a single delayed sleep-wake phase diag- nosis, with the recognition that most cases reflect variable chronobiologic and behav- ioral contributions. </br>Demographics The exact prevalence of DSWPD in the general population is unknown.</br>The condition is more common among adolescents and young adults, with a reported prevalence of 7% to 16%.</br>It is estimated that DSWPD is seen in approximately 10% of patients pre- senting in sleep clinics with recurrent insomnia complaints.</br>There have been no studies assessing racial/ethnic differences in DSWPD. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Most individuals with DSWPD are evening chronotypes.</br>Many adolescents experi- ence a biological endogenous shift towards later bedtimes beginning around puberty.</br>Genetic factors such as polymorphism in the circadian clock gene hPer3 are associated with DSWPD.</br>Environmental factors, including decreased exposure to light during the phase advance region of the phase response curve (PRC) (i.e., in the morning on days with early wake times) or increased exposure to bright light during the phase delay portion of the PRC (i.e., late in the evening) may exacerbate the delayed circa- dian phase.</br>Individuals may have increased sensitivity in the phase delay region or decreased sensitivity in the phase advance region of the phase response curve to light.</br>Maladjustment to changes in work and social schedules, travel across time zones, and shift work can precipitate this disorder.</br>Individuals may consume excessive

 to treat symptoms of insomnia and sleepiness during normal waking hours may lead to substance abuse. </br>Developmental Issues DSWPD may be encountered in any age group but is especially prevalent among ado- lescents and young adults.</br>In addition to the clinical features described elsewhere, DSWPD may present in older children and adolescents with chief complaints of truancy, repeated school absences, chronic tardiness and/or school failure, rather than sleep complaints per se.</br>In severe cases, school attendance is completely curtailed and the patient may have failed to attend school regularly for many months.</br>Extreme diffi- culty in morning awakening, requiring intensive parental involvement, may also be the presenting concern.</br>An increased risk of motor vehicle accidents has been associated with delayed sleep onset and resultant insufficient sleep in adolescents; thus, the occur- rence of a car crash or “near-miss” incident should alert the clinician to probe for addi- tional evidence of circadian pathology.</br>Adolescents may also present primarily with mood complaints (depression, suicidal ideation).</br>Chronic insomnia is commonly asso- ciated with and may be the chief presenting complaint in adolescents with DSWPD as a result of repeated attempts and failures to achieve sleep onset at their desired bedtime. </br>In younger children, the condition may be associated with delays in other markers of circadian phase, including the typical presleep surge in alertness referred to as the “for- bidden zone” or “second wind phenomenon.”</br>Thus, especially in younger children, DSWPD may present primarily as bedtime resistance, as caregivers attempt to establish bedtimes that directly conflict with the child’s circadian-mediated readiness for sleep. </br>194 Several pediatric populations appear to have an increased vulnerability to DSWPD and sleep disturbances, likely of multifactorial etiology.</br>These include children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</br>Several studies have examined melatonin onset in children with ADHD and reported significant delays in comparison with typically developing children, as well as suc- cessful treatment with

.</br>Children with ASD have a high prevalence (up to 80%) of sleep disturbances, including delayed sleep onset, night and early morning awakenings, and irregular sleep patterns, at least some of which appear associated with circadian abnormalities.</br>These children reportedly have a number of alterations in mel-</br>atonin synthesis, levels, amplitude, and patterns of secretion. </br>Little is known about the natural history of the clinical entity of DSWPD in the pediat- ric population, including the impact of various treatment modalities, the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms, or long-term consequences. </br>There is increasing evidence to suggest that the evening chronotype is associated in both children and adolescents with a number of adverse consequences, including decreased health-related quality of life, higher rates of behavioral/emotional problems including depression and suicidality, decreased sleep duration and increased daytime sleepiness, more sleep complaints, impairments in academic functioning, and increased likelihood of substance use.</br>Thus, eveningness may confer an increased risk for physical and mental health problems. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The exact mechanisms responsible for DSWPD are unknown.</br>An abnormal interac- tion between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep homeostatic process that regulates sleep and wakefulness may play an essential role in the pathophysiology of DSWPD.</br>Early studies reported an altered phase relationship between the sleep-wake cycle and circadian phase, whereas more recent studies have failed to support this finding.</br>In these patients, sleep onset, sleep offset, and phase of circadian markers such as core body temperature and

 are delayed relative to clock time when com- pared with controls.</br>Although this condition may be predominantly due to a misalign- ment between circadian timing and the external environment, alterations in the length of the circadian period or an altered homeostatic process (indicated by decreased sleep propensity in response to sleep deprivation) also may be contributing factors.</br>In chil- dren and adults, voluntary behaviors such as staying awake late at night and waking up late in the morning or afternoon may result in an abnormal relationship between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep homeostatic process that regulates sleep and wakefulness.</br>Delayed bedtimes and wake times may increase exposure to bright Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders light in the late evening (a delay signal for the circadian clock) and decrease expo- sure to light in the early morning (an advance signal for the circadian clock), thereby promoting and perpetuating the delay in the circadian sleep phase.</br>Given a sufficient discrepancy between early and late wake times, early wake times may be associated with bright light exposure during the maximal phase delay region, perpetuating the cir- cadian phase delay and the disorder.</br>Individuals may have alterations in sensitivity to the phase shifting effects of light.</br>For example, partial sleep deprivation encountered with this disorder can also attenuate the ability to phase-advance the circadian system, further perpetuating the delayed circadian phase. </br>Objective Findings Recordings of sleep logs and actigraphy over an interval of at least seven (and pref- erably fourteen) consecutive days demonstrate delayed sleep onset and sleep offset (typically greater than two hours) relative to socially acceptable times.</br>Though clock times may be culture dependent, for many affected individuals sleep onset is typi- cally delayed until 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., (though may be earlier based on age and developmental status), and wake time occurs in the late morning or afternoon.</br>Daily demands and schedules may result in an earlier than desired wake-up time during work or school days, but a delay in bedtime and wake-up time is almost always seen during free days and vacation.</br>Polysomnography (though not routinely indicated nor required for the diagnosis), when performed at preferred (delayed) sleep times, is essentially normal for age.</br>If a conventional bedtime and wake-up time are enforced, however, polysomnographic recording may show prolonged sleep latency and decreased total sleep time.</br>Laboratory measures of circadian timing generally show the expected phase delay in the timing of the nadir of the core body temperature rhythm and dim- light melatonin onset (DLMO).</br>Several questionnaires are useful in assessing the chro- notype, the degree of eveningness or morningness (e.g., “Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire,” “Munich Chronotype Questionnaire”).</br>Individuals with DSWPD, typ- ically score high as evening types, though normal sleepers can also score high on eve- ningness.</br>Elevations are expected in self-report of daytime sleepiness, such as on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. </br>The results of polysomnography and other diagnostic tools in younger age groups are similar to those seen in adults.</br>Actigraphy and/or sleep logs are useful in the diagnosis of DSWPD in the pediatric population.</br>Several validated instruments are available for assessing phase preference in the pediatric and adolescent pop- ulations.</br>These include the Children’s Chronotype Questionnaire (CCTQ) (par- ent-report), the Morningness-Eveningness Scale for Children (self-report), and the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents.</br>These surveys have been used to assess chronotype in the pediatric population and may be useful in clinical settings. </br>Differential Diagnosis Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder must be distinguished from “normal” sleep pat- terns, particularly in adolescents and young adults who maintain delayed schedules regularly or intermittently, without distress or impaired functioning.</br>DSWPD must be distinguished from other causes of difficulty initiating sleep, including chronic insom- nia disorder.</br>In DSWPD, sleep initiation and maintenance are improved when the patient is allowed to sleep on the preferred schedule.</br>When individuals with DSWPD must arise before the desired wake time, excessive sleep inertia and excessive daytime sleepiness may be evident.</br>Other forms of excessive daytime sleepiness, from which this must be distinguished, do not generally exhibit the pronounced circadian pattern and do not abate with alterations in the sleep-wake schedule.</br>The development of DSWPD may be influenced by alterations in circadian physiology as well as behavioral factors. </br>Inadequate sleep hygiene and insufficient sleep syndrome must also be considered in the differential. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions There is limited knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of DSWPD.</br>Recent evidence suggests that alteration in the homeostatic regulation of sleep and alertness may play an important role.</br>The intrinsic circadian period may be abnormally long.</br>Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular basis for the generation and entrainment of circadian rhythms, together with the identification of a familial form of DSWPD, will lead to improved understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this condition, as well as targeted, evidence-based therapies. </br>Bibliography Ancoli-Israel S, Schnierow B, Kelsoe J,

Symptoms are present for at least three months. </br>C. When patients are allowed to sleep in accordance with their internal biological clock, sleep quality and duration are improved with a consistent but advanced timing of the major sleep episode. </br>198 D. Sleep log and, whenever possible, actigraphy monitoring for at least seven days (preferably 14 days) demonstrate a stable advance in the timing of the habitual sleep period.</br>Both work/school days and free days must be included within this monitoring. </br>E.</br>The sleep disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder. </br>Notes .</br>Standardized chronotype questionnaires are useful tools to assess the chronotype of eveningness and morningness.</br>Individuals with advanced sleep phase score as morning types. </br>2. Demonstration of an advance (typically greater than two hours) in the timing of other circadian rhythms such as DLMO or urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin is desirable to confirm the advanced circadian phase. </br>Essential Features Advanced sleep-wake phase disorder (ASWPD) is characterized by a stable advance (earlier timing) of the major sleep episode, such that habitual sleep onset and offset occur typically two or more hours prior to required or desired times.</br>Affected individ- uals complain of early morning or maintenance insomnia and excessive evening sleep- iness.</br>When affected individuals are allowed to maintain an advanced schedule, sleep quality and quantity are improved. </br>Associated Features Individuals with ASWPD may experience chronic partial sleep loss due to early morning and maintenance insomnia, particularly if sleep is resisted during early evening. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Familial patterns are discussed below. </br>Demographics The prevalence of ASWPD in the general population is unknown.</br>In one large survey study involving middle-aged adults (40-64 years), the population prevalence was esti- mated at 1%, although it is unclear what proportion of these subjects would deem their schedule to be significantly troublesome so as to warrant clinical attention.</br>Until the identification of familial cohorts (see below), only four cases were described in the lit- erature.</br>There is no known sex difference. </br>199 Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Predisposing and</br>Precipitating Factors Advanced age appears to be a risk factor.</br>Among a cohort aged 20 to 59 years, older age was associated with increased morningness, which was determined to be a sig- nificant mediator of numerous age-sleep relationships.</br>A patient’s ability to sleep at an abnormal circadian phase (phase tolerance) also impacts the degree to which adverse symptoms are experienced, and this adaptability varies among individuals.</br>Conflicting results have been obtained with respect to the relationship between age and phase tolerance, with some suggesting that age decreases phase tolerance, and others suggesting that age may actually be protective.</br>Methodological differences preclude direct comparisons of the investigations, as do wide variations in the age groups studied.</br>Genetic factors also can influence the development of the condition, as has been definitively demonstrated among select familial cohorts (see Pathology and Pathophysiology section).</br>Environmental influences may precipitate, maintain, or exacerbate the advanced circadian phase, but this has not been proven.</br>ASWPD has been reported in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.</br>In particular, studies in children with autism spectrum disorders and Smith-Magenis syndrome have shown profound alterations in melatonin secretion profiles, which may manifest as a phase advance with very early morning waking. </br>Familial Patterns Various groups have described kindreds with familial ASWPD.</br>These cases may be characterized by an earlier age of onset.</br>It is not clear whether the familial or non- familial variety of the condition is more common. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Repetitive attempts to resume sleep with awakenings may result in the development of a comorbid chronic insomnia disorder.</br>Individuals may use alcohol, other

 to alleviate symptoms, potentially exacerbating the underlying sleep/ wake disorder.</br>The impact on caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disor- ders and ASWPD may be particularly profound. </br>Developmental Issues ASWPD is most frequently encountered among older age groups.</br>An early age of onset of ASWPD should prompt further probing for a familial pattern.</br>Caregivers may report that a child wakes “too early” in the morning, which is disruptive to the house- hold routine and may curtail parental sleep.</br>This is particularly true for younger chil- dren, who may require adult supervision once they are awake.</br>However, this complaint regarding the waking pattern is often more related to unrealistic caregiver expecta- tions regarding an “appropriate” wake time for a young child and/or a developmentally inappropriate early bedtime resulting in prolonged time in bed, rather than to a true advance in sleep onset and offset.</br>In some cases, children are motivated to wake up earlier than desired because they are reinforced for this behavior by parental attention or the opportunity to watch television or utilize other media upon waking.</br>The com- plaint that a child “falls asleep too early” in the evening, especially in adolescence, is rare and should raise concerns regarding the possibility of chronically insufficient sleep and/or a sleep disorder resulting in increased sleep needs.</br>The rarity of observa- tions of advanced sleep onset and offset times among young children may also be due in part to societal expectations of earlier bed and wake times for this age group; thus, a misalignment with circadian preference is less likely. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Possible etiologies include: (1) an alteration in the ability of the circadian clock to phase delay; (2) a dominant phase advance region of the light phase response curve to entraining agents; (3) altered strength of entraining agents, such as light exposure at the appropriate circadian time (voluntarily or involuntarily induced); or (4) a shortened endogenous circadian period of the pacemaker.</br>Among these proposed mechanisms, only the latter has been definitively demonstrated among select familial ASWPD sub- jects.</br>Genetic analyses revealed a missense mutation in a casein kinase (CK1ε) binding region of a Period gene (hPer2), culminating in hypophosphorylation by CK1ε in vitro.</br>Hypophosphorylation of the Period protein results in promotion of its transcription and, ultimately, a decrease in the period length of the clock.</br>However, genetic het- erogeneity is apparent within familial ASWPD, as demonstrated by the fact that other cohorts from this same study and another study did not reveal mutations in hPer2.</br>A separate report of a Japanese familial ASWPD cohort described a missense mutation in a different casein kinase gene (CKIδ), which also resulted in decreased enzymatic activity in vitro.</br>Yet another group described associations between hPer1 and hPer2 polymorphisms and extreme morningness circadian preferences (questionnaire-based), in the absence of discrete ASWPD. </br>Objective Findings Among patients with familial ASWPD, laboratory measures to determine the phase of circadian rhythms reliably show the expected phase advance in the timing of the nadir of the temperature rhythm and the dim light melatonin onset, in comparison with unaf- fected controls.</br>Among those with nonfamilial ASWPD, a wider range of timing of circadian markers is found, with some values approaching those of unaffected controls. </br>Polysomnography (though not routinely indicated nor required for the diagnosis), when performed at preferred (advanced) sleep times, is essentially normal for age.</br>If Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders a conventional bedtime and wake-up time is enforced, however, polysomnographic recording may show short sleep latency and early awakening with curtailment of total sleep time. </br>Differential Diagnosis ASWPD must be distinguished from “normal” sleep patterns, particularly among the elderly or very young, who often maintain advanced schedules without distress or impaired functioning.</br>ASWPD must also be distinguished from other causes of early awakening, including chronic insomnia disorder.</br>Poor sleep hygiene practices, partic- ularly evening napping among the elderly, and irregularity of the sleep-wake schedule should also be considered.</br>The possibility of a “free-running” (nonentrained) circadian rhythm also merits consideration, but patients with this condition are most commonly blind and report only periodic complaints of insomnia depending on the relative rela- tionship between the internal rhythm and that of the light/dark cycle.</br>Major depressive disorder is a common cause of early awakening that must be considered.</br>These patients do not typically manifest the early evening sleepiness that is characteristic of ASWPD.</br>As with any sleep disturbances that persists over time, insomnia can develop second- arily.</br>The Horne-Östberg questionnaire (or other chronotype questionnaire) may assist in determining the contribution of a morningness circadian preference to the presenting sleep/wake complaint.</br>The presence of more than one contributing variable seems to be the norm, and each entity needs to be treated accordingly. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions The existing literature suggests that clinicians are unlikely to encounter patients with stringently defined ASWPD.</br>Until the identification of familial cohorts, only four cases were described.</br>Various treatment trials also support this contention with demon- stration of objectively conventional sleep and wake times despite study entry based on subjective reports of advanced sleep phase.</br>Select studies of patients with sole complaints of maintenance insomnia/early-morning awakenings have demonstrated marked advances (earlier timing) of physiologically measured circadian rhythms.</br>The absence of the early evening sleepiness complaint may be due to the fact that the timing of sleep onset can be more readily modified than wake time, and is likely to be more actively resisted due to its propensity to conflict with social or family obligations.</br>Alternatively, evening sleep that occurs prior to entering the bed/bedroom may not be reported as such.</br>If it is definitively demonstrated that the evening sleepiness complaint is not present or is not prominent, the term advance-related sleep complaints may be used in lieu of ASWPD.</br>If this broader term is used, the condition is observed more commonly (~7% of respondents in a study of individuals aged 40-64 years).</br>There is limited knowledge of the pathophysiology of ASWPD (or advance-related sleep complaints) beyond those associated with select cases of familial ASWPD.</br>Increased use of physiologic circadian assessments will require the development of normative values to guide practitioners.</br>Knowledge gaps are even more prominent within pediat- ric and adolescent populations. </br>Bibliography Ando K, Kripke DF, Ancoli-Israel S.

Symptoms are present for at least three months. </br>C. Sleep log and, whenever possible, actigraphy monitoring for at least seven days, preferably 14 days, demonstrate no major sleep period and multiple irregular sleep bouts (at least three) during a 24-hour period. </br>D.</br>The sleep disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder. </br>Essential Features Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder (ISWRD) is characterized by lack of a clearly defined circadian rhythm of sleep and wake.</br>The chronic or recurring sleep-wake pattern is temporally disorganized so that sleep and wake episodes are variable throughout the 24-hour cycle.</br>Individuals have symptoms of insomnia and excessive sleepiness, depending on the time of day and their particular sleep-wake pattern. </br>Associated Features ISWRD is more commonly observed in neurodegenerative disorders, such as demen- tia, and in children with developmental disorders.</br>Individuals typically present with insomnia or excessive sleepiness, depending on the time of day.</br>Sleep and wake epi- sodes across the 24-hour cycle are fragmented, with the longest sleep bout being typi- cally less than four hours.</br>Individuals or caregivers report frequent naps throughout the daytime.</br>Total sleep time across the 24 hours may be normal for age. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Older adults with Alzheimer disease who experience sundowning may represent a clin- ical subtype with more severe sleep fragmentation and lower circadian rhythm ampli- tude than those who do not experience sundowning. </br>204 Demographics Demographic patterns generally parallel those of associated risk factors such as neuro- developmental and neurodegenerative disorders. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and Huntington disease increase the risk for ISWRD.</br>Children with developmental disor- ders also are at increased risk for ISWRD. </br>Poor sleep hygiene and lack of exposure to external synchronizing agents such as light, activity, and social schedules may be predisposing as well as precipitating factors involved in the development of ISWRD, particularly in the institutionalized elderly. </br>Familial Patterns Not applicable or known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Onset of the condition may occur at any age.</br>Little is known regarding the course and complications of ISWRD in adults.</br>Due to the multiple awakenings and, in the elderly, nocturnal wandering, falls can be an indirect complication.</br>In addition to the patient’s sleep-wake dysfunction, the caregiver’s sleep is often disrupted.</br>The sleep and wake disruption associated with ISWRD is a common cause of institutionalization. </br>Developmental Issues Caregivers may report that a child with ISWRD has difficulty falling asleep at the desired bedtime or “falls asleep too early” in the evening, wakes “too early” or has dif- ficulty waking in the morning, and/or exhibits developmentally inappropriate napping behavior during the day.</br>Parents may complain that their child sleeps too much or too little or at inappropriate times.</br>Attempts to keep the child awake during the day, especially during sedentary activities, are often unsuccessful.</br>The key characteristics that distinguish ISWRD from other sleep complaints or circadian sleep wake disor- ders are the lack of prolonged consolidated sleep periods, the often seemingly random distribution in sleep periods across the 24-hour day, and the marked day-to-day and week-to-week variability with little in the way of a clearly predictable major sleep- wake pattern.</br>The impact on caregivers’ sleep and daytime functioning is likely to be particularly profound. </br>There may be phenotypes of ISWRD in children, with differences regarding symptom presentation and severity and chronicity that are related to the underlying condition. </br>205 Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders For example, it is possible that children with chronic neurologic conditions such as autism or chromosomal syndromes characterized by developmental delays may have a more intractable and treatment resistant pattern compared with children with more self-limited conditions (e.g., postconcussion). </br>Although ISWRD appears to be rare in typically developing children, it may be envi- ronmentally or behaviorally

ISWRD.</br>For example, children with autism, Asperger syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise spec- ified often have highly irregular sleep patterns.</br>In addition, these children often have circadian rhythm abnormalities which are both more severe and chronic and they are at increased risk for relapse. </br>Both ISWRD and non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder are also common in Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with an abnormality of chromosome 15q11-q13, and have been reported in children with Williams syndrome, a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder characterized by physical abnormalities and a dis- tinctive cognitive profile with intellectual disabilities and learning difficulties.</br>Studies in children and adults with autism

 and its metabolites and daytime elevation and abnormal rhythm/decreased amplitude of melatonin secretion have been reported in these popu- lations.</br>These findings may be due to polymorphisms in melatonin enzymes synthesis or variants in genes coding for melatonin receptors.</br>Other postulated mechanisms for circadian rhythm disturbances, particularly ISWRD, in these populations include clock gene polymorphisms and decreased levels of entrainment by social/environmental cues. </br>There may also be medical conditions that predispose typically developing children and adolescents to ISWRD.</br>These include traumatic brain injury and chronic fatigue syndrome.</br>Brain tumor survivors, especially patients who have experienced disrup- tion in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, may have an increased prevalence of circadian rhythm disorders, including ISWRD. </br>There is very little literature on ISWRD in the pediatric population; prevalence, sex, and racial/ethnic differences are unknown.</br>Little is known about the natural history of the clinical entity of ISWRD in the pediatric population, including the impact of various treatment modalities, the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms, or long-term consequences.</br>The impact on caregivers of children with neurodevelopmen- tal disorders and ISWRD may be particularly profound. </br>The prevalence of ISWRD increases with advancing age, but it is likely that age-re- lated increase in neurodegenerative disorders, rather than aging per se, explains this relationship. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The etiology of ISWRD is likely multifactorial.</br>Anatomic or functional abnormal- ities of the circadian clock can result in an arrhythmic pattern of rest and activity.</br>Decreased exposure to environmental-entraining agents, such as light and structured physical and social activities (common in institutionalized elderly, and children with developmental disorders), also can contribute to the development of an irregular sleep-wake cycle. </br>Objective Findings In addition to a careful sleep history, sleep log and actigraphy monitoring show the expected lack of a clearly defined circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, which, instead, is characterized by multiple irregular sleep and wake bouts throughout the 24-hour period.</br>The use of sleep log and actigraphy is indicated for the identification of irregular sleep wake rhythm.</br>The irregular sleep-wake pattern is defined as having multiple sleep bouts (typically 2–4 hours) during a 24-hour period.</br>The pattern may vary from day to day, thus monitoring for at least seven days and preferably 14 days may be needed to differentiate the irregular pattern from other circadian rhythm sleep- wake disorders. </br>Polysomnography is not required to establish the diagnosis.</br>Polysomnography may be useful for the diagnosis of other comorbid sleep disorders.</br>Monitoring of other circa- dian rhythms, such as core body temperature and

Symptoms persist over the course of at least three months. </br>C. Daily sleep logs and actigraphy for at least 14 days, preferably longer for blind persons, demonstrate a pattern of sleep and wake times that typically delay each day, with a circadian period that is usually longer than 24 hours. </br>D.</br>The sleep disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder. </br>Notes .</br>Patients may present with a progressively delaying sleep-wake pattern and intermittent insomnia and excessive sleepiness.</br>Individual symptoms will depend on when an individual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep-wake propensity.</br>The magnitude of the daily delay will depend on the endogenous circadian period, and may range from less than 30 minutes (when the period is close to 24 hours) to more than an hour (when the period is longer than 25 hours). </br>2. The symptomatic episode will typically begin with a gradual increase in sleep latency and delayed sleep onset.</br>As the sleep propensity rhythm shifts into the daytime, patients will have difficulty falling asleep at night and staying awake during the day.</br>As the sleep-wake propensity rhythm drifts further, patients will eventually complain of late afternoon and evening sleepiness and naps as well as an early sleep onset time and short sleep latency. </br>3. Other circadian rhythms, such as the DLMO or urinary 6-sulfatoxy- melatonin rhythm obtained at two time points 2-4 weeks apart (i.e., to allow sufficient time for the drift to be apparent) is desirable to confirm the nonentrained rhythm. </br>Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Essential Features Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder (N24SWD) is characterized by symptoms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness that occur because the intrinsic circadian pace- maker is not entrained to a 24-hour light/dark cycle.</br>The non-24-hour period can be shorter or, more typically, longer than 24 hours.</br>Because the endogenous circadian rhythm is not aligned to the external 24-hour environment, symptoms will depend on when an individual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep and wake propensity.</br>Individuals typically present with episodes of difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, excessive sleepiness or both, alternating with short asymp- tomatic periods.</br>The severity of individual sleep-wake symptoms can be variable.</br>Starting with the asymptomatic period when the individual’s endogenous rhythm is aligned to the external environment and required sleep-wake times, sleep latency will gradually increase and the individual will complain of sleep-onset insomnia.</br>As the sleep phase continues to drift so that maximal endogenous sleep propensity is now in the daytime, individuals will have trouble staying awake during the day (exhibiting multiple daytime naps) and complain of sleepiness. </br>Associated Features Most individuals with nonentrained circadian rhythms are totally blind, and the failure to entrain circadian rhythms is related to the lack of photic input to the cir- cadian pacemaker.</br>A small proportion of totally blind people may retain functional circadian photoreception and entrained rhythms if their blindness is due exclusively to an outer retina disorder (rod and cone layer) with retention of functional, intrin- sically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and the retinohypothalamic pathway.</br>Some blind people may also be able to entrain to nonphotic cues (e.g., the timing of physical activity), producing entrainment at an adverse phase in some cases.</br>In sighted people, social and behavioral factors also play an important role in the development and maintenance of the disorder, as there is an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders.</br>Occasionally, the disorder is associated with developmental intellectual disability or dementia.</br>In sighted individuals, there is often a history of delayed sleep phase, and decreased exposure to light and structured social and phys- ical activity.</br>Some sighted individuals with N24SWD also demonstrate increased sleep duration. </br>Demographics It is thought that over half of totally blind individuals have non-24-hour circa- dian rhythms; 50% to 80% of blind individuals complain of sleep disturbances.</br>The prevalence, sex, and racial/ethnic differences of N24SWD in adults and children are unknown. </br>210 Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Total blindness is the most common predisposing condition.</br>In sighted people, the dis- order can be induced by certain environmental conditions, such as decreased or inap- propriately timed exposure to circadian entraining agents, particularly light.</br>Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder may predispose to N24SWD in sighted persons.</br>The con- dition has developed after chronotherapy for DSWPD.</br>This disorder has also been reported in adults following traumatic brain injury. </br>Familial Patterns Not applicable or known. </br>Developmental Issues Caregivers may report that a child has difficulty falling asleep at the desired bedtime or “falls asleep too early” in the evening, wakes “too early” or has difficulty waking in the morning and staying awake during the day.</br>Parents may complain that their child sleeps too much or too little or at inappropriate times.</br>The key characteristics that distinguish N24SWD from other sleep complaints or circadian sleep wake dis- orders are twofold: (1) the predictable pattern of misalignment between the child’s sleep patterns and the light-dark 24-hour cycle (progressive delay in sleep onset-offset across days to weeks); and (2) periods of apparent “symptom remission” during those transient intervals when the child’s circadian sleep-wake propensity coincides with the desired bed and wake times.</br>The impact on caregivers’ sleep and daytime functioning is often profound. </br>Although N24SWD is extremely rare in typically developing or sighted children, it has been reported with some frequency in children with intellectual disabilities and blindness.</br>For example, children with optic nerve hypoplasia due to a variety of under- lying causes, especially those children with hypoplastic corpus callosum and comor- bid severe intellectual and visual impairments, have been reported to have features of N24SWD. N24SWD has also been described in pediatric patients with Rett syndrome (a genetic disorder occurring almost exclusively in girls, characterized by severe developmental regression, language delays, and limited social interactions), autism spectrum disorders, and Angelman syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder asso- ciated with an abnormality of chromosome 15q11-q13.</br>The common mechanism in all of these disorders is postulated to be lack of entrainment to the

 day that results from the failure to perceive and/or attend to social/environmental zeitgebers (time cues).</br>There have also been several case reports which describe the emergence of N24SWD in intellectually normal sighted children or adolescents who have limited or inappropriate exposure to environmental and other entraining cues (e.g., decreased Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders light during the day and/or excessive light exposure in the evening).</br>These individuals are likely to have significant psychiatric impairments that predispose them to avoid- ance of social interactions (e.g., anxiety) or medical conditions that involve enforced prolonged periods of inactivity (traumatic brain injury, chronic fatigue). </br>Little is known about the natural history of the clinical entity of N24SWD in the pedi- atric population, including the impact of various treatment modalities, the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms, or long-term consequences. </br>There may be varying phenotypes of N24SWD in children, with differences in regard to symptom presentation, severity, and chronicity that are related to the underlying condition.</br>For example, it is likely that children with chronic neurologic conditions such as blindness or neurodevelopmental disabilities have a more intractable and treat- ment resistant pattern compared to children with more self-limited conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury). </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Onset may occur at any age in blind individuals, coincident with loss of light percep- tion, and, in congenitally blind children, onset can occur from birth or during infancy.</br>If untreated, the course is chronic.</br>Attempts to regulate sleep and wake times may involve the use of alcohol, sedatives-

 day.</br>The light-dark cycle is the most important environmental time cue (zeitgeber) in humans (as in other species), although nonphotic time cues also play a role in normal entrainment.</br>A lack of photic input to the circadian pacemaker is clearly the cause of nonentrained rhythms in totally blind people.</br>It has been suggested that, in sighted individuals, a systematic delay due to inadequate exposure to light may contribute to the development of N24SWD.</br>In addition, the disorder may be caused by an extremely prolonged endogenous circadian period that is outside of the range for entrainment to the 24-hour cycle or by an alteration in the response of the circadian clock to the entraining effects of light. </br>212 Objective Findings Sleep studies yield different results depending on the degree of synchrony between sleep times and the circadian pacemaker at the time when the sleep study is performed.</br>Recording of sleep log and actigraphy over prolonged periods (at least 14 days, but ideally longer in blind individuals) demonstrate the lack of a stable relationship between the timing of the sleep-wake cycle and the

There is a report of insomnia and/or excessive sleepiness, accompanied by a reduction of total sleep time, which is associated with a recurring work schedule that overlaps the usual time for sleep. </br>B. The symptoms have been present and associated with the shift work schedule for at least three months. </br>C. Sleep log and actigraphy monitoring (whenever possible and preferably with concurrent light exposure measurement) for at least 14 days (work and free days) demonstrate a disturbed sleep and wake pattern. </br>D.</br>The sleep and/or wake disturbance are not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental disorder, medication use, poor sleep hygiene, or substance use disorder. </br>Essential Features Shift work disorder is characterized by complaints of insomnia or excessive sleepi- ness that occur in association with work hours that occur, at least in part, during the usual sleep episode.</br>There are several types of shift-work schedules, including evening shifts, night shifts, early morning shifts, rotating shifts, split shifts, on-call overnight duty, and long duration work shifts that include work hours at night.</br>The sleep distur- bance is most commonly reported in association with night shifts, early morning shifts, and rotating shifts.</br>Total sleep time is typically curtailed by one to four hours, and sleep quality is perceived as unsatisfactory in night, early morning, and rotating shift workers as well as in those who work long-duration shifts.</br>In addition to impairment of performance at work, reduced alertness may also be associated with consequences for safety during the work schedule and on the commute to and from work.</br>The sleep disorder occurs despite attempts to optimize environmental conditions for sleep.</br>The condition usually persists only for the duration of the shift work schedule.</br>However, in some individuals, the sleep disturbance may persist beyond the duration of shift work. </br>Associated Features Early morning work shifts starting between 4:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. can also be asso- ciated with complaints of difficulty in sleep initiation as well as difficulty awakening. </br>215 Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Permanent evening shifts may be primarily associated with sleep maintenance dif- ficulty.</br>Excessive sleepiness usually occurs during work shifts (mainly night, early morning, and rotating shifts), often accompanied by the need to nap and by impaired mental ability due to the reduced alertness.</br>Reduced alertness and increased fatigue throughout the waking period may be associated with reduced performance capacity, and with consequences for safety.</br>Also, major portions of free time may have to be used for recovery of sleep, resulting in adverse social consequences.</br>When compared with shift workers without shift work disorder, patients with shift work disorder report greater mood problems, such as impatience, avoidance of interaction with coworkers, a higher risk of depression, impaired social functioning, and lower coping skills.</br>Patients with shift work disorder also have a higher risk of subjective health complaints, ulcers, and substance abuse.</br>Risk for sleepiness-related errors and accidents are highest at night, especially in the early morning hours.</br>Drowsy driving accident risk is highest in the morning hours when night shift workers commute home and early morning workers commute to work. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes There are substantial individual differences in the ability to adjust to shift work.</br>However, mechanisms underlying these individual differences are not known. </br>Requirement of extended work hours, such as on-call overnight duty and long-duration work shifts that include work hours at night, represents a specific clinical subtype.</br>In addition to the circadian misalignment (having to work during the night), sleep loss and fatigue associated with prolonged continuous work may increase the severity of excessive sleepiness and performance impairments. </br>Demographics The prevalence of shift work disorder depends on the prevalence of shift work in the population.</br>It has been estimated that approximately 20% of the workforce in indus- trialized countries is employed in a job that requires shift work.</br>Although the actual prevalence of clinically significant sleep disturbance and excessive daytime sleepiness due to work schedules is unknown, the total number of night-shift workers suggests that an estimated prevalence of 2% to 5% of the general population is reasonable.</br>The prevalence of shift work disorder among rotating- and night-shift workers has been estimated to be between ~10% and 38%.</br>These figures do not, however, include individuals with early morning or split shift work, which may be other at-risk groups.</br>There is no known sex or racial difference in vulnerability. </br>216 Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Depending on the type of shift, circadian preference may influence the ability to adjust to or tolerate shift work.</br>For example, individuals described as morning types obtain shorter daytime sleep after a night shift.</br>Persons with comorbid medical, psychiat- ric, and other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and individuals with a strong need for stable hours of sleep may be at particular risk.</br>Social pressures before and after a work shift also contribute to short sleep durations in shift workers (e.g., social inter- actions with family and friends, domestic obligations, a second job, and leisure activ- ities).</br>Social pressures also diminish the desire or willingness to maintain a consis- tent daytime sleep schedule on days off, thereby reducing the likelihood of circadian adjustment. </br>Familial Patterns Not applicable or known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications </br>The condition is closely linked to work schedules and typically remits when the major sleep episode is scheduled at a conventional time.</br>Because there are so many different work schedules, ranging from an occasional overnight shift to regular night work, the course is quite variable.</br>Because shift work is often combined with extended hours of duty, fatigue can be a complicating factor.</br>Circadian adaptation is often counteracted by exposure to light at the wrong time of the day and the tendency of most workers to resume full daytime activities and nighttime sleep during weekends and vacations.</br>It has been hypothesized that in some individuals, the condition may lead to chronic sleep disturbances.</br>Complications may include exacerbation of gastrointestinal, met- abolic, reproductive, neoplastic, and cardiovascular disorders.</br>Disruptions of social and family life are frequent.</br>Drug and alcohol dependency may result from attempts to improve the sleep and wakefulness disturbances produced by shift work.</br>Fatigue and excessive sleepiness due to the combination of sleep loss and circadian misalignment pose important safety concerns.</br>The level of alertness required of the worker, in addi- tion to the intensity of symptoms, needs to be taken into account when evaluating the disorder.</br>For example, the threshold for intervention may be lower for workers whose performance is critical for personal or public safety (for example, health care workers or nuclear power plant or public transport operators). </br>Developmental Issues Not applicable or known. </br>217 Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Pathology and Pathophysiology The condition is thought to be directly related to circadian misalignment and sleep loss.</br>The sleep disturbance is generated by a circadian alerting process that corre- sponds with the time that the worker needs to sleep.</br>The excessive sleepiness during the night and early morning appears to be partly related to cumulative sleep loss and partly due to a decreased circadian alerting signal that corresponds with the work time and the commute to and from work.</br>Tolerance to night work varies considerably and may involve differences in the degree of circadian adaptation (“clock resetting”) to a night-work, day-sleep schedule.</br>Alternatively, tolerance may be related to individual differences in response to circadian and homeostatic influences on sleep and wakeful- ness regulation.</br>Environmental and social factors may exacerbate sleep loss associated with shift work schedules. </br>Objective Findings The condition can usually be diagnosed by history.</br>Sleep logs and actigraphy are rec- ommended to demonstrate a disrupted sleep-wake pattern consistent with shift work disorder.</br>Polysomnographic recordings, while not required for the diagnosis, are useful if the etiology of the sleep disturbance is in question (for example to rule out sleep apnea or narcolepsy).</br>Polysomnography during a typical daytime sleep episode after a work shift also can be useful to determine the severity of the sleep disruption, although this is undertaken almost exclusively for research studies of shift work disor- der.</br>Polysomnography may demonstrate impaired sleep quality, with prolonged sleep latency, sleep maintenance difficulty, or shortened total sleep time, depending on the timing of the sleep episode in relation to the underlying phase of the circadian timing system.</br>The sleep episode may be fragmented, with frequent arousals and awaken- ings.</br>The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) may demonstrate excessive sleepiness during the time of the work shift.</br>If available, measures of the unmasked melatonin rhythm are useful to indicate the degree of circadian misalignment. </br>Differential Diagnosis The excessive sleepiness should be differentiated from that caused by other primary sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy.</br>Insufficient sleep related to conflicting daytime activities (for example, child care) or from environmental interference with sleep (for example, daytime noise) often contributes to sleepiness.</br>Sometimes patients with DSWPD may adopt a night-work schedule that is more con- gruent with their sleep preferences.</br>Insomnia and excessive sleepiness may also suggest other persistent circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.</br>However, historical informa- tion on the relation between the occurrence of disturbed sleep and work-hour distribu- tion should provide sufficient information to indicate the correct diagnosis.</br>Increasing frustration, negative expectations, and poor sleep hygiene may predispose the person to the development of coexisting chronic insomnia disorder that could persist beyond the shift work schedule (i.e., shift work may represent a precipitating event that leads to chronic problems with insomnia).</br>Drug and alcohol abuse or dependency may result from efforts to treat the sleep disturbance. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions </br>Although there is sufficient information regarding the prevalence of shift work in indus- trialized populations, less information is available regarding the actual prevalence of shift work disorder and its impact on health and safety.</br>Further research is needed to improve the definition of what constitutes shift work disorder, to develop diagnostic tools for shift work disorder, to determine the prevalence of shift work disorder using diagnostic criteria, to elucidate the burden of shift work disorder over and above that which may be due to shift work in general, to investigate mechanisms underlying the health and safety consequences of shift work disorder, and to determine which shift workers are at greatest risk of shift work disorder.</br>Furthermore, there is limited information on the role of age, sex, and circadian chronotype on the vulnerability to shift work disorder. </br>Bibliography Akerstedt T.

There is associated impairment of daytime function, general malaise, or somatic symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal disturbance) within one to two days after travel. </br>C. The sleep disturbance is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder. </br>Essential Features Jet lag disorder is characterized by a temporary mismatch between the timing of the sleep and wake cycle generated by the endogenous circadian clock and that of the sleep and wake pattern required by a change in time zone.</br>Individuals complain of disturbed sleep, sleepiness and fatigue, and impaired daytime function.</br>The severity and duration of symptoms is dependent on the number of time zones traveled, the ability to sleep while traveling, exposure to appropriate circadian times cues in the new environment, tolerance to circadian misalignment when awake during the bio- logical night, and the direction of the travel.</br>Eastward travel (requiring advancing circadian rhythms and sleep-wake hours) is usually more difficult to adjust to than westward travel. </br>Associated Features In addition to sleep disturbance and decreased daytime alertness, associated features may include general malaise and gastrointestinal symptoms.</br>Numerous other variables related to travel, such as sleep loss, decreased mobility, and alcohol and/or caffeine intake, contribute to the overall fatigue.</br>Daytime sleepiness can lead to memory diffi- culties, problems concentrating, driving and flying, and to impaired decision-making.</br>Sleepiness, sleep disturbance and circadian misalignment associated with jet lag may also impair athletic performance.</br>Effects of jet lag not only affect travelers, but also can have significant consequences for airline pilots and flight attendants. </br>220 Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes There are individual differences in the ability to adjust to rapid shifts in time zones; however, specific clinical subtypes have not been identified. </br>Demographics Jet lag affects all age, sex, and racial groups.</br>Limited available data suggest that older individuals may experience fewer jet lag symptoms compared with younger individu- als.</br>However, the data have limitations and further research is needed to better define the relationship between age and the development of jet lag disorder. </br>There are no studies on the prevalence of jet lag disorder. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Disturbed sleep and/or shortened sleep duration before and during travel contribute to jet lag symptoms.</br>Prolonged uncomfortable sitting positions, air quality and pressure, stress, and excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption may increase the severity of insomnia and impaired alertness and function associated with transmeridian travel. </br>Eastward travel often leads to difficulties with sleep onset as attempts to sleep are made at an earlier internal circadian time when the travelers’ biological clock is pro- moting alertness (i.e., biological day).</br>Difficulty awakening and daytime sleepiness and fatigue occur because wake time also occurs at an earlier biological time when the circadian clock is still promoting sleep (i.e., during the travelers’ biological night). </br>Westward jet travel often leads to sleepiness and fatigue in the evening hours of the new time zone as the internal circadian clock of the traveler is promoting sleep (i.e., biological night).</br>Sleep disturbance in the new time zone is typically manifest as a sleep maintenance issue with early morning awakenings and difficulty returning to sleep because the internal circadian clock of the traveler is promoting wakefulness during the sleep episode (i.e., biological day). </br>Basic circadian science principles suggest that inappropriately timed exposure to light and darkness during and immediately after jet travel can shift the circadian clock in the wrong direction, thereby increasing the duration of jet lag symptoms.</br>Time at destina- tion upon arrival may also influence jet lag symptoms with fewer symptoms reported following midday arrivals after eastward travel. </br>An individual’s innate circadian preference may also confer a greater or lesser ability to adjust to a particular time shift, but this finding has not been systematically assessed. Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Jet lag is often reported to be worse after eastward than westward travel.</br>Westward travel may generally be easier because the genetically determined period of the cir- cadian clock in humans is on average longer than 24 hours.</br>A circadian period longer than 24 hours is associated with a circadian drive or physiological tendency for bed and wake times to be later, thus making it easier to shift the circadian clock during west- ward travel to more delayed sleep and wake times.</br>However, 20% to 25% of humans have circadian periods that are near to, or shorter than, 24 hours, and these individuals may find it easier to adapt to eastward travel. </br>Familial Patterns Not applicable or known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Jet lag is usually a temporary condition.</br>Symptoms begin approximately one to two days after air travel across at least two time zones and are self-limited.</br>The severity and duration of symptoms are usually in proportion to the number of time zones trav- eled and the direction of travel.</br>It is estimated that it takes one day per time zone for circadian rhythms to adjust to the local time.</br>However, if traveling more than six time zones, circadian rhythms may shift in the opposite direction, resulting in a prolonged period of adjustment that may last up to several weeks and increased severity of jet-lag symptoms.</br>Exposure to light at inappropriate times may prolong the time of adjust- ment by shifting the circadian rhythms in the opposite direction.</br>Menstrual and repro- ductive problems have been associated with frequent transmeridian travel in female airline personnel.</br>Poor sleep hygiene practices may perpetuate sleep/wake complaints, and repetitive failed attempts to initiate or maintain sleep at desired times may predis- pose to the development of insomnia disorder. </br>Developmental Issues The effect of age on the development or severity of jet lag disorder symptoms is unknown. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The symptoms of jet lag disorder are due to both desynchronization of endogenous circadian rhythms with local time and sleep disturbance.</br>The severity of symptoms can be influenced by the environment and behaviors of the traveler.</br>Factors inherent to jet travel, including prolonged time spent sitting in a confined space, ability to sleep on long-haul flights, decreased physical activity, and a low oxygen environment, may influence severity. </br>222 Objective Findings Objective laboratory testing usually is not indicated.</br>When performed, polysomnogra- phy or actigraphy shows disturbed sleep and a loss of a normal sleep-wake pattern or a mismatch between the timing of sleep and wakefulness with the desired sleep-wake pattern of the local time. </br>Differential Diagnosis A thorough history and physical examination should be performed to exclude other mental, physical, or sleep disorders.</br>Somatic complaints of gastrointestinal symptoms may indicate an underlying medical condition.</br>When jet lag symptoms persist, increas- ing frustration, negative expectations, and poor sleep hygiene may predispose the indi- vidual to the development of chronic insomnia disorder. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Understanding mechanisms of individual differences in vulnerability and tolerance to disturbed sleep and wakefulness during jet lag is necessary.</br>Development of effective and practical strategies to combat jet-lag symptoms and improve sleep, performance and safety are needed. </br>It is unknown how expression of the disorder varies across the life span. </br>Bibliography Auger RR, Morgenthaler TI.</br>Jet lag and other sleep disorders relevant to the traveler.</br>Travel Med Infect Dis 2009;7:60–8. </br>Burgess HJ, Crowley SJ, Gazda CJ, Fogg LF.</br>Eastman CI.</br>Preflight adjustment to eastward travel: 3 days of advancing sleep with and without morning bright light.</br>J Biol Rhythms 2003;18:318–28. </br>Daan S, Lewy AJ.</br>Scheduled exposure to daylight: a potential strategy to reduce “jet lag” following transmeridian flight.</br>

Unspecified ...........................................................................278 Isolated Symptoms and Normal Variants Sleep Talking ..............................................................................................279 Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry into sleep, within sleep, or during arousal from sleep.</br>Parasomnias may occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), rapid eye movement sleep (REM), or during transitions to and from sleep. </br>Parasomnias encompass abnormal sleep related complex movements, behaviors, emo- tions, perceptions, dreams, and autonomic nervous system activity.</br>Parasomnias are clinical disorders because of the resulting injuries, sleep disruption, adverse health effects, and untoward psychosocial effects.</br>The clinical consequences of the parasom- nias can affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. </br>Human consciousness consists of three essential states: Wake, NREM sleep, and REM sleep.</br>The three states are modulated by a host of influences including the degree of ami- nergic and cholinergic neurochemical bias, central nervous system (CNS) activation, Parasomnias and the degree of endogenous versus exogenous input.</br>Under normal physiologic conditions, which include homeostatic drive and circadian rhythmicity, the process of state declaration is maintained in a stable and predictable fashion throughout a 24-hour period.</br>However, as the sleep-wake cycle oscillates, the normally distinct states of con- sciousness may be rendered into a state that is not fully declared, resulting in a tempo- rary unstable state of dissociation.</br>Thus, sleep and wake can be viewed as occurring on a spectrum rather than being entirely dichotomous states. </br>Parasomnias are the result of such state dissociation.</br>Recent research has shown that com- binations of one or more of these states do occur and may result in unstable states of altered consciousness manifesting as parasomnias.</br>Disorders of arousal, such as sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals are an admixture of wakefulness and NREM sleep.</br>Higher cognitive function is severely impaired, if not absent, while the potential for motor capacity has, for the most part, been retained.</br>REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is an admixture of REM sleep coupled with waking or NREM sleep levels of tonic EMG activity.</br>All three states may be present in the same individual as an overlap of disorders. </br>The comingling of basic states of consciousness is the result of different forms of pathophysiology.</br>In disorders of arousal, no identifiable neuropathology is present, but functional changes in cerebral activity during NREM sleep are present, essentially resulting in a brain in which certain areas are deactivated (asleep) and others remain activated (awake).</br>This CNS activation, with concomitant skeletal muscle and auto- nomic nervous system activation, is believed to reflect a functional disabling of, or damage to, brain areas usually responsible for the inhibition of these activities during sleep.</br>Additionally, sleep inertia, sleep state instability, and locomotor/central pattern generators are thought to contribute to the occurrence of NREM parasomnias. </br>NREM disorders of arousal frequently appear to involve the disinhibition of “basic drive states” such as feeding, sex, and aggression.</br>Here, it has been postulated that central pattern generators elicit primal fixed action patterns that would otherwise have been inhibited by the prefrontal cortex during wake.</br>In this regard, aggression is typ- ically abrupt in onset and characterized by apparent instinctual defensive posturing as opposed to behaviors that are complex and procedural.</br>These can emerge in pathologic forms with the parasomnias, as seen with sleep related aggression and locomotion, sleep related eating disorder (SRED), and abnormal sleep related sexual behaviors. </br>In contrast, RBD often results from serious neuropathology.</br>Initially, this neuropathology affects the area of the brain responsible for inhibiting muscle tone during REM sleep.</br>As a result, dreams may be enacted.</br>In the case of REM-related behaviors, the experience and activity reflect the actual, often aggressive content of a dream.</br>It is frequently pos- sible to correlate observed movements with later descriptions of the dream.</br>The initial appearance of RBD symptoms is often followed years later by the development of neu- rodegenerative disorders, particularly Parkinson disease and related synucleinopathies. </br>Abnormal sleep related movements comprise a separate category of disorders, which is detailed in the sleep related movement disorders section.</br>Unlike the parasomnias, which typ- ically entail more complex movements and behavior, the movement disorders encompass a broad range of predominantly simple motoric activities: myoclonic, repetitive, rocking, rhythmic, grinding, cramping, fragmentary, dystonic, or dyskinetic movements or tremors, which are not usually associated with dream mentation or experiential concomitants. </br>Parasomnias involve sleep related behaviors and experiences over which there is no conscious deliberate control.</br>There are ten core categories of parasomnias listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd Edition.</br>Only one of the core cat- egories, RBD, requires video-polysomnographic documentation as one of the essen- tial diagnostic criteria.</br>However, for most of the other parasomnias, polysomnographic monitoring can provide corroborative documentation in support of the clinical diagnosis. </br>Considerable advances have taken place in understanding the neurophysiologic aspects of abnormal arousals from slow wave sleep associated with the disorders of arousal.</br>Advances in the clinical understanding of these NREM sleep parasomnias have occurred as well, particularly in regard to their prevalence and severity in adults.</br>In regard to RBD, long-term delayed emergence of neurodegeneration has frequently been found in middle-aged and older adults following onset of

The arousals are associated with ambulation and other complex behaviors out of bed. </br>229 Parasomnias Sleep Terrors ICD-9-CM code: 307.46 Alternate Names Night terrors, pavor nocturnus. </br>Diagnostic Criteria Criteria A-C must be met ICD-10-CM code:</br>F51.4 A.</br>The disorder meets general criteria for NREM disorders of arousal. </br>B. The arousals are characterized by episodes of abrupt terror, typically beginning with an alarming vocalization such as a frightening scream. </br>C. There is intense fear and signs of autonomic arousal, including mydriasis, tachycardia, tachypnea, and diaphoresis during an episode. </br>Essential Features Disorders of arousal consist of complex behaviors that are usually initiated during partial arousals from slow wave (N3) sleep.</br>Most episodes are brief, but they may last as long as 30 to 40 minutes in some children.</br>Sleep talking and shouting may accompany these events.</br>The eyes are usually open during an episode and, not uncom- monly, are wide open with a confused “glassy” stare.</br>The patient with a disorder of arousal may be very difficult to awaken and, when awakened, is often confused.</br>There is usually amnesia for these episodes, although adults may remember fragments of episodes.</br>Dream-like mentation is sometimes reported in adults.</br>Other high-level cog- nitive functions such as attention, planning, social interaction, and intent are absent.</br>Because disorders of arousal usually originate from slow wave sleep, they most often emerge in the first third or first half of the typical sleep period.</br>They may occur during other times of increased slow wave sleep, such as during recovery sleep following sleep deprivation.</br>They rarely arise from a daytime nap. </br>Disorders of arousal are encountered most commonly in children and typically resolve by puberty but may persist (or, infrequently, arise de novo) in adolescence or adulthood. </br>Confusional Arousals: Confusional arousals, unlike sleepwalking, occur with the patient in bed.</br>When the patient leaves the bed, sleepwalking has been initiated.</br>Confusional arousals often start with the individual sitting up in bed and looking about in a confused manner. </br>Sleepwalking: Sleepwalking episodes typically begin as confusional arousals.</br>Sleepwalking episodes can also begin with the individual immediately leaving the bed and walking or even “bolting” from the bed and running.</br>Highly inappropriate, agitated, resistive, belligerent, or violent behavior can also occur.</br>Behaviors can be simple and non–goal-directed, or complex and protracted, and may involve inappro- priate sexual activity with oneself or an individual in close proximity such as a bed partner.</br>The ambulation may terminate spontaneously, at times in inappropriate places, or the sleepwalker may return to bed, lie down, and continue to sleep without reach- ing conscious awareness at any point.</br>The sleepwalking individual is disoriented in time and place, with slow speech, with severely diminished mentation, and blunted response to questions or requests.</br>There is often prominent anterograde and retrograde memory impairment.</br>Despite diminished external perception as a result of blockade of sensory input, the individual may appear to be awake during some or most of a disorder of arousal with reduced vigilance and impaired cognitive response. </br>Sleep Terrors: Sleep terrors differ from other disorders of arousal in that the events are often accompanied by a cry or piercing scream, accompanied by autonomic nervous system and behavioral manifestations of intense fear.</br>There is often intense autonomic discharge, with tachycardia, tachypnea, flushing of the skin, diaphoresis, mydriasis, and increased muscle tone.</br>The person usually sits up in bed; is unresponsive to exter- nal stimuli; and, if awakened, is confused and disoriented.</br>However, bolting out of bed and running is not uncommon in adults and also can be associated with violent behav- iors, particularly if attempts are made to block or restrain the individual.</br>The sleep terror episode may be accompanied by incoherent vocalizations.</br>Sometimes there is prolonged inconsolability associated with a sleep terror in children or adults. </br>Associated Features Disorders of arousal are devoid of higher cognitive functions such as planning, memory from before an incident, formation of a memory during an incident, true social inter- action, or recognition of others.</br>Patients exhibiting disorders of arousal are not con- sciously aware and behaviors are often thought to be “automatic” in nature.</br>Self-injury may occur as well as injury to others in close proximity. </br>Disorders of arousal, in particular sleepwalking, can involve normal, routine behav- iors that are inappropriate only in regard to their timing.</br>More often, however, sleep- walking involves inappropriate behaviors, such as urinating in a wastebasket, moving furniture around haphazardly, or climbing out a window.</br>Sleepwalkers are sometimes able to navigate in familiar surroundings, but are prone to bumping into objects or falling down.</br>A sudden arousal consistent with sleep terrors may segue rapidly into agitated sleepwalking and panicky running and other potentially dangerous behav- iors.</br>Self-injury is not unusual and when resulting in death has been given the term of Parasomnias Parasomnias “parasomnia pseudosuicide.”</br>Cuts, bruises, and other injuries may occur—often to the surprise of the sleepwalker once awake.</br>Sleepwalkers are reported to have a high tol- erance for pain.</br>Knife cuts, burns, and other self-injury sustained during sleepwalking may not awaken them. </br>Violence to others also can occur with adult sleepwalking, especially in men.</br>The sleepwalker does not generally seek out the eventual victim of violence.</br>More typi-</br>cally, a person attempting to block, grab, restrain, redirect or awaken a sleepwalker during an episode may be violently attacked, even if they are family members or friends.</br>This may result in a form of primitive defensive aggression including pushing, hitting, kicking, or throwing objects.</br>This pattern also has been reported in the sleep laboratory when technical personnel have attempted to return sleepwalking patients to bed.</br>In extreme cases, victims have been stabbed with knives or blunt objects.</br>Such inappropriate and antisocial behaviors have legal and forensic implications, as sleep- walkers have been arrested and charged with assault and battery, attempted homicide, homicide, and sexual assault with indecency. </br>The child with calm sleepwalking may quietly walk toward a light or to the parents’ bedroom.</br>Occasionally, children will walk toward a window or door or even go outside, with obvious attendant risk. </br>Clinical or Pathophysiological Subtypes Sleep related abnormal sexual behaviors are primarily classified as confusional arous- als in that they typically occur without any behaviors outside of the bed (or chosen sleep- ing accommodation), but have also been less commonly associated with sleepwalking.</br>Other terms for this condition include “atypical sexual behavior during sleep,” “sexsom- nia,” and “sleep sex.”</br>Sleep related abnormal sexual behaviors often have major inter- personal, clinical, and occasional criminal consequences.</br>The set of abnormal sexual behaviors during disordered arousals includes prolonged or violent masturbation, sexual molestation and assaults (of minors and adults), initiation of sexual intercourse irre- spective of the menstrual status of the bed partner (in contrast to waking intercourse for those individuals), and loud (sexual) vocalizations during sleep—followed by morning amnesia.</br>The preponderance of patients have also been diagnosed with a NREM sleep parasomnia, most often confusional arousals alone but on occasion with sleepwalking, sleep related driving, or sleep related eating disorder.</br>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is another recognized precipitant of sleep related abnormal sexual behaviors. </br>The presence of an overlap disorder, in which RBD and a partial arousal disorder (sleepwalking or sleep terrors) are comorbid in a patient, may complicate diagnosis of each condition.</br>Careful review of history and use of polysomnography may facilitate identification of this presentation. </br>Demographics There is no sex difference with disorders of arousals.</br>They are especially prevalent among children and adults younger than 35 years.</br>The prevalence rate of confusional arousals and sleepwalking are similar. </br>The prevalence of confusional arousals in children three to 13 years of age in a large population-based study was 17.3%.</br>Lifetime prevalence of confusional arousals has recently been reported as 18.5% (16.1-20.9 confidence interval).</br>The prevalence among adults older than 15 years is 2.9% to 4.2%. </br>The lifetime prevalence of sleepwalking is as high as 18.3%.</br>A recent study of “noctur- nal wandering” that likely included a large percentage of sleepwalkers reported a life- time prevalence of 29.2%.</br>A Swedish study of children aged 6-16 years found the inci- dence of sleepwalking to be 40%.</br>Up to 4.3% of adults sleepwalk.</br>In one series, one third of 54 adult patients with injurious sleepwalking (with or without night terrors) began sleepwalking after 16 years of age. </br>The prevalence of sleep terrors has not been studied as thoroughly.</br>Prevalence rates of 1% to 6.5% in children and 2.2% in adults have been reported, with a virtually constant prevalence rate of 2.3% to 2.6% in the 15-year-old to 64-year-old age group, before falling to 1% in the older than 65 years age group.</br>Other studies have reported the intermittent appearance of sleep terrors in 25% of children younger than five years. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Disorders of arousal are most often evaluated in terms of predisposing, priming, and precipitating (triggering) factors.</br>Most often a simultaneous co-occurrence of these factors is thought necessary in order for a disorder of arousal occur.</br>However, the reason a disorder of arousal occurs on one night and not others is not fully understood. </br>A genetic predisposition has been hypothesized and several studies have identified dif- ferent genetic loci and modes of inheritance (see Familial Pattern, below).</br>In childhood, disorder of arousal can usually be considered an expected and normal developmental sleep phenomenon, apart from those cases with clinical consequences.</br>However, dis- orders of arousal that persist beyond adolescence or begin in adulthood can often be problematic and may require clinical attention. </br>233 Parasomnias Parasomnias Many priming factors for disorders of arousal, in particular sleepwalking, have been identified.</br>Sleep deprivation and situational stress are the most potent factors.</br>Hyperthyroidism, migraines, head injury, encephalitis, stroke, and other conditions have also been reported much more rarely as potential priming factors. </br>OSA and other sleep related respiratory events are increasingly recognized precipitants of disorders of arousal in both children and adults.</br>Treatment of these comorbid con- ditions may reduce or eliminate the occurrence of disorders of arousal.</br>Disorders of arousal may also be triggered by environmental stimuli such as telephone calls, pagers, messaging from electronic devices, and a host of other stimuli.</br>It is clinically important to note that first responders, physicians, and others on call may be vulnerable to such stimuli, increasing the potential for inappropriate responses and behavior. </br>Travel, sleeping in unfamiliar surroundings, febrile states in children, physical or emo- tional stress in adults, the premenstrual period in women, as well as the use of psycho- tropic medications such as

</mark>
, phenothiazines, anticholinergic agents, and sedative/hypnotic agents have been associated with the onset of sleepwalking, but a causal relationship has yet to be established.</br>Alcohol has been identified in previous reports as a potential sleepwalking trigger.</br>However, the amnesia associated with dis- orders of arousal makes these reports unreliable.</br>More recent evidence-based reviews have found no compelling relationship between alcohol and disorders of arousal.</br>Internal stimuli, such as a distended bladder, or external stimuli, such as noise or light, can also precipitate episodes. </br>There is no significant association between childhood disorders of arousal and psycho- pathology.</br>In adult sleepwalking, although a considerable number of patients may have a past or current history of nonpsychotic depressive and anxiety disorders, it does not appear that the psychiatric disorder and sleepwalking, in particular, are tightly linked.</br>In addition, when the two conditions emerge in close temporal proximity, control of the psychiatric disorder often does not control the parasomnia, for which separate treatment is required. </br>Familial Pattern Genetic factors appear to play an important role in all of the disorders of arousal.</br>However, published research data exist primarily for patients who sleepwalk.</br>Sleepwalking has a familial pattern.</br>The rate of childhood sleepwalking increases in relation to the number of affected parents: 22% when neither parent has the disor- der, 45% if one parent is affected, and 60% when both are affected.</br>Population-based studies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins suggest that genetic factors play a role in 65% of cases of sleepwalking.</br>Different models of modes of inheritance includ- ing multifactorial, recessive with incomplete penetrance, and autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance have been proposed, based primarily on analysis of family histories.</br>However, these finding are not sufficiently specific to be used for diagnostic testing.</br>Further, the mechanisms by which a genetic predisposition for confusional arousal or other related disorders contributes to their occurrence are not known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Confusional arousals most often appear in early childhood around the age of two years.</br>This childhood form of confusional arousals is typically benign, but may cause concern in parents.</br>Confusional arousals of early childhood diminish in occurrence after the age of five years. </br>Sleepwalking can begin as soon as a child is able to walk but may begin at almost any time in the life cycle, including as late as the seventh decade.</br>Sleepwalking is often preceded by confusional arousals.</br>Childhood sleepwalking usually disappears sponta- neously around puberty but may persist into adolescence.</br>Episodes can occur sporad- ically or with high frequency, such as multiple times nightly for several consecutive nights.</br>Sleepwalking may occur for the first time in adulthood or may recur in adult- hood during periods of sleep deprivation or stress. </br>Sleep terrors usually emerge in children aged four to 12 years (but can also emerge in adulthood) and tend to resolve spontaneously by early adolescence, as does sleep- walking.</br>Social embarrassment over the sleep terrors can impair social relationships in children and adults.</br>Serious or even lethal injuries can occur. </br>Developmental Issues As noted above, disorders of arousal most often occur initially in childhood and decrease in occurrence steadily until young adulthood.</br>However, they may occur for the first time in adulthood or reappear after many asymptomatic years, often related to stress, sleep deprivation, or development of another sleep disorder. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The overwhelming majority of individuals with disorders of arousal do not have neuro- logical or psychological pathology.</br>There are rare reported cases of confusional arous- als associated with brain lesions in areas subserving arousal, such as the posterior hypothalamus, midbrain reticular area, and periventricular gray matter.</br>However, data from a single patient with confusional arousals suggest that they may be due to a func- tional abnormality in the brain that leaves some regions, such as hippocampus and Parasomnias Parasomnias frontal associative cortices, asleep, while other parts of the brain such as motor, cingu- late, insular, amygdala, and temporopolar cortices, are active or awake. </br>It is generally considered that disorders of arousal represent a dissociation of different regions of the brain in addition to activation of locomotor centers/central pattern</br>gen- erators, accompanied by sleep inertia and sleep state instability. </br>Objective Findings Although not routinely indicated for the evaluation of typical, uncomplicated, and non- injurious parasomnias, polysomnographic studies demonstrate that disorders of arousal typically begin after an arousal from slow wave sleep, most commonly toward the end of the first or second episode of slow wave sleep.</br>Occasionally, disorders of arousal can emerge from stage N2 sleep.</br>Heart rate acceleration, increased muscle tone, and muscle twitching may rarely be observed before a slow wave sleep arousal. </br>Diagnostic polysomnography may note high-amplitude hypersynchronous delta waves and frequent arousals from slow wave sleep.</br>However, these findings have a low spec- ificity and have been reported to occur in other disorders such as OSA and in asymp- tomatic individuals.</br>On rare occasions, polysomnography can provide support for the clinical diagnosis by documenting arousals from slow wave sleep accompanied by behaviors typical of confusional arousals.</br>Out-of-bed behaviors are very rare in the sleep laboratory.</br>Changes between the home and sleep laboratory environment, timing, habits, and other factors may serve to decrease the likelihood of sleepwalking in the laboratory.</br>Time-synchronized video-polysomnographic (vPSG) recording is essen- tial if polysomnography (PSG) is to be used as support for the diagnosis.</br>However, a normal PSG does not rule out the diagnosis of a disorder of arousal.</br>In adults in whom there are only one or two episodes per year, there is a very low likelihood of occurrence in the sleep laboratory.</br>However, the sleep study may assist in ruling out disorders with similar presentations, such as RBD or nocturnal epilepsy.</br>PSG may further be useful by identifying potential triggers, such as sleep related breathing disorder or peri- odic leg movements that are currently present.</br>Provocative sleep studies using sleep deprivation and acoustic stimuli have been used for research purposes, with success.</br>However, the sensitivity and specificity of these techniques for clinical purposes are unknown. </br>Postarousal EEG recordings in children and adults with sleepwalking often demon-</br>strate a partial or virtually complete persistence of sleep, with diffuse, rhythmic delta activity; diffuse delta and theta activity; mixed delta, theta,

 activity. </br>236 PSG also may be helpful in excluding the diagnosis of RBD by demonstration of normal muscle atonia in REM sleep (assuming adequate amounts of REM sleep are observed).</br>Although the “macrostructure” of sleep (i.e., the cycling of various NREM and REM sleep stages and the relative distributions of these sleep stages) is generally preserved with sleepwalking, the “microstructure” of sleep can be perturbed.</br>Power spectral analyses of slow wave activity in adult sleepwalkers have revealed several forms of slow wave sleep dysregulation, including high amounts of slow wave sleep fragmentation (particularly during the first NREM-REM sleep cycle), a significant increase in delta power just prior to an arousal, and increased slow wave activity across all NREM sleep cycles. </br>Differential Diagnosis Disorders of arousal should be carefully distinguished from other disorders with similar presentations, but different pathophysiologies, courses, and treatments.</br>Other disorders to be considered include RBD, sleep related epilepsy, sleep related dissocia- tive disorders, alcohol and drug related behaviors, and OSA. </br>RBD typically presents as dream-enacting behaviors during the second half of the night and usually affects middle-aged men, but also can affect women and virtually any age group.</br>Because sleepwalking in adults can also present as dream-enacting behaviors that emerge during any time of the night, vPSG may be necessary to distinguish sleep- walking from RBD.</br>In contrast to disorders of arousal, signs of RBD, particularly tonic/phasic EMG activity during REM sleep, are almost always present during sleep studies.</br>If sleepwalking (or sleep terrors) occurs with

 in the same patient, both should be diagnosed.</br>This has been referred to as a parasomnia overlap disorder. </br>Other sleep disorders, such as OSA, can precipitate disorders of arousal.</br>Therefore, a careful history must be obtained to identify other sleep disorders.</br>Sleep related epilepsy can manifest with wandering behavior or with frenzied walking or running.</br>In adults, a diagnosis of malingering also should be considered.</br>If a neurologic or medical disor- der is identified as the precipitant of a disorder of arousal, then the sleepwalking should be diagnosed as parasomnia due to a medical disorder. </br>Disorders of arousal should not be diagnosed in the presence of alcohol intoxication.</br>The behavior of the alcohol-intoxicated individual may superficially resemble that of the sleepwalker.</br>However, the sleepwalker is typically severely cognitively impaired, but with only limited motor impairment.</br>The alcohol-intoxicated individual’s level of cognitive functioning may be reduced, but not absent, whereas motor behavior is often severely impaired.</br>In alcoholic blackouts, where anterograde amnesia is, by definition, Parasomnias Parasomnias the cardinal manifestation, it is important to note that outward motor behavior and cog- nitive function may not be impaired and may be perceived as normal.</br>Thus, the impor- tance of appreciating the neuroscience of alcoholic blackouts and its potential role in the explanation of unusual and bizarre nocturnal behaviors cannot be understated because these can mimic parasomnias.</br>The former are exponentially more prevalent and thus should be given appropriate weight when attributing likely causation in cases with criminal allegations. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions With the development of sophisticated genetic testing and neuroimaging, direct research into the causes and mechanisms of disorders or arousals is anticipated.</br>Further investigations that aid in the characterization of the pathophysiology are necessary.</br>Further development of sleep laboratory-based techniques for provoking episodes of sleepwalking would improve diagnostic accuracy. </br>Bibliography Achermann P, Werth E, Dijk DJ, Borbély AA.</br>Time course of

Recurrent episodes of dysfunctional eating that occur after an arousal during the main sleep period. </br>B. The presence of at least one of the following in association with the recurrent episodes of involuntary eating: .</br>Consumption of peculiar forms or combinations of food or inedible or toxic substances. </br>2. Sleep related injurious or potentially injurious behaviors performed while in pursuit of food or while cooking food. </br>3. Adverse health consequences from recurrent nocturnal eating. </br>C. There is partial or complete loss of conscious awareness during the eating episode, with subsequent impaired recall. </br>D.</br>The disturbance is not better explained by another sleep disorder, mental disorder, medical disorder, medication, or substance use. </br>Essential Features SRED consists of recurrent episodes of involuntary eating and drinking during arous- als from sleep, associated with diminished levels of consciousness and subsequent recall, with problematic consequences. </br>The episodes of eating always occur in an involuntary or “out of control” manner after an interval of sleep.</br>Typically, they occur during partial arousals from sleep with subsequent partial recall.</br>On the one hand, some patients cannot be easily brought to full consciousness during an episode of eating, as is the case with sleepwalking, and may have no recall of having eaten during the night.</br>On the other hand, some patients seemingly have considerable alertness during an episode and have substantial recall in the morning.</br>There may be variability of awareness and subsequent recall within one night, and across the evolution of the disorder in individual patients.</br>The recurrent episodes of involuntary eating and drinking during the main sleep period are typically associated with a feeling of lack of control over eating. </br>240 Problematic features of the recurrent sleep related eating include the following: con- sumption of peculiar forms or combinations of food, or of inedible or toxic substances (e.g., frozen pizzas, raw bacon, buttered cigarettes, cat food and salt sandwiches, coffee grounds, ammonia cleaning solutions); sleep related injury (e.g., lacerations from care- less manipulation of kitchen utensils; internal or external burns from consuming or spilling hot foods or beverages; or poisoning and internal injuries from ingesting toxic substances); adverse health consequences (e.g., dental caries and tooth chipping from biting frozen foods); weight gain; obesity (including morbid obesity resulting in bar- iatric surgery); various metabolic problems, such as destabilization or precipitation of diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia; nonrestorative sleep from sleep disruption; morning anorexia and abdominal distention.</br>SRED carries the risk of consuming foods to which one is allergic.</br>Also, overnight fasting prior to next-day surgery or testing can be compromised.</br>Secondary depressive disorders may emerge from longstanding personal dejection and a sense of failure over the inability to control the nocturnal eating.</br>Secondary food restriction, prompted by despair over not being able to stop the nocturnal eating, often occurs at some point during the course of the disorder.</br>Patients may engage in potentially hazardous (and expensive) weight-loss regimens.</br>Insomnia can also be a complication. </br>Associated Features Nightly eating, including multiple episodes nightly, is reported by a majority of affected individuals.</br>The episodes of eating occur during any time in the sleep cycle.</br>High-caloric foods are typically preferred.</br>The foods preferentially consumed during sleep related eating are not typically consumed with preference during the daytime.</br>Paradoxically, to the extent that there is recall, hunger and thirst are notably absent during episodes of compulsive eating with SRED.</br>The episodes of eating are some- times experienced as food-related enactment of a dream.</br>Simple foods or entire hot or cold meals may be prepared and consumed.</br>Careless food handling often occurs.</br>Alcoholic beverages are almost never consumed.</br>The usual response to interference during an eating episode is irritability and agitation. </br>Clinical or Pathophysiological Subtypes None known. </br>Demographics The following rates of SRED, as determined by self-administered questionnaire, have been reported: 16.7% in an inpatient eating disorders group; 8.7% in an outpatient eating disorders group; and 4.6% in an unselected university student group.</br>This study would indicate a high prevalence of SRED, although confirmatory studies across Parasomnias Parasomnias different clinical and nonclinical population groups are needed.</br>Females comprise 60% to 83% of patients in reported series.</br>Mean age of onset of SRED is reported to be 22-39 years.</br>In the reported series, the mean duration of SRED prior to clinical presen- tation ranged from four to 15 years, suggesting that SRED often is a chronic disorder. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors SRED can be idiopathic, but it appears to be most commonly associated with a primary sleep disorder, another clinical condition, or use of a sedative-hypnotic medication.</br>Sleepwalking is the most common sleep disorder associated with sleep related eating, although once eating becomes part of the behavioral repertoire, it quickly becomes the predominant, if not the exclusive, nocturnal “sleepwalking” behavior.</br>This would indi- cate that SRED is most often a “sleepwalking variant disorder.”</br>A history of sleepwalk- ing during childhood appears to be a predisposing factor in many cases.</br>A recent retro- spective controlled study of SRED patients, sleepwalking patients, and controls found that SRED patients were mainly women with onset of the disturbance in adulthood.</br>They typically experienced nightly episodes and had more frequent eating problems in childhood and higher current anorexia scores than sleepwalking patients or controls.</br>They also shared commonalities with sleepwalking patients, including a high (66%) frequency of past or current sleepwalking, a similar timing of parasomnia episodes (in the first half of the night), and numerous arousals from stage N3.</br>On video-polysom- nography, eating episodes occurred mostly within one minute after awakening from stage N2 or N3.</br>The frequencies of RLS, PLMs, and sleep apnea were similar across the three groups. </br>Other sleep disorders that can be closely associated with SRED include: RLS, PLMD, OSA, and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, particularly irregular sleep/ wake pattern.</br>Multiple sleep disorders in the same patient have been reported with SRED, including sexsomnia and a variant of confusional arousals and sleepwalking.</br>Medication-induced SRED has been reported with

.</br>The course is usually unremitting.</br>Fires can occur when the individual with SRED begins to cook foods on the stove or in the oven, and then abandons them.</br>A variety of other complications have been described previously. </br>Developmental Issues SRED can emerge in childhood, either associated or unassociated with a family history of SRED. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The underlying pathophysiology of SRED is unclear.</br>Despite the broad range of pre- disposing and precipitating factors in SRED, the relatively homogeneous set of clinical features suggests the presence of a “final common pathway” that can be accessed by a variety of factors.</br>Although SRED has prominent features of both a sleep disorder and an eating disorder, its relatively homogeneous presentation supports its classification as a separate diagnostic entity.</br>More than half of patients with SRED have a history of another parasomnia that preceded the onset of nocturnal eating, suggesting that the presence of another parasomnia is a major risk factor for SRED.</br>However, the female predominance in SRED is more consistent with eating disorders, which are female pre- dominant, than with sleepwalking or movement disorders (RLS/PLMD) which have slight to no female bias.</br>Thus it appears that two basic drive states—sleeping and eating—are pathologically intertwined in SRED. </br>243 Parasomnias Parasomnias Objective Findings Although not routinely indicated in the assessment of SRED, vPSG evaluations have often reported positive findings.</br>The most common finding consists of multiple confu- sional arousals, with or without eating, arising from slow wave sleep.</br>However, abnor- mal arousals have been documented from all stages of NREM sleep and also occasion- ally from REM sleep.</br>The level of consciousness has typically spanned the range from virtual unconsciousness to various levels of partial consciousness despite a concurrent EEG pattern that is often predominantly awake, suggesting dissociation between the EEG and the level of consciousness.</br>This dissociation also can be found in adult sleep- walking without associated eating.</br>In contrast, classic sleepwalking in childhood is usually associated with the persistence of high-voltage delta waves or the admixture of delta, theta, and alpha activity.</br>A predominant wake pattern is rare in childhood sleep- walking.</br>PLMs and OSA may be observed in polysomnographic monitoring of SRED patients.</br>In one recent study that addressed the boundaries between SRED and fully conscious abnormal nocturnal eating, 22 of 35 patients had PLMs, 5 of 35 had RLS, and 29 of 35 had recurring chewing and swallowing movements during sleep that were associated with nearly half of the total number of EEG arousals. </br>Differential Diagnosis SRED must be distinguished primarily from night eating syndrome (NES), which is characterized by excessive eating between dinner and bedtime and during full awaken- ings during the sleep period.</br>In contrast to daytime eating disorders (bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa), inappropriate compensatory behavior, such as self-induced vom- iting, enemas, misuse of

, or other medications, or other purging activity, are not present in SRED, although the two conditions may be comorbid.</br>A person with a daytime eating disorder may also have a coexisting SRED that is asso- ciated with confusional arousals but not associated with purging behaviors during the night or upon arising in the morning.</br>Patients with longstanding SRED and excessive weight gain may eventually fast during the daytime and/or engage in excessive exer- cise to prevent obesity from the SRED.</br>Likewise, patients who otherwise fulfill crite- ria for SRED may consciously eat during the prebedtime period in a futile attempt to suppress the compulsion to eat after subsequently falling asleep. </br>SRED appears to be considerably more female predominant that NES (which has &lt; 60% female prevalence), and mood disorders are more common with NES than with SRED.</br>Nevertheless, SRED and NES share a considerable number of overlapping features and may exist along a common spectrum of pathophysiology.</br>SRED should also be distinguished from nocturnal (sleep related) extensions of bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and anorexia nervosa, binge/purge type. </br>244 The nocturnal eating (drinking) syndrome described in the original International Classification of Sleep Disorders is primarily a disorder of infancy that is characterized by recurrent awakenings with the inability to resume sleep without eating or drinking.</br>Kleine-Levin syndrome (periodic hypersomnia) can present with inappropriate noctur- nal eating, but its predominance in adolescent males and its hallmark symptom complex of periodic hypersomnia, hypersexuality, and hyperphagia lasting days to weeks should easily distinguish it from SRED.</br>Medical and neurologic disorders that could be asso- ciated with abnormal recurrent eating during the main sleep period (usually with full or almost full alertness) should also be excluded.</br>These include: hypoglycemic states, peptic ulcer disease, reflux esophagitis, and

 can be diagnosed as RBD, using clinical judgment, pending future longitudinal studies. </br>Essential Features RBD is characterized by abnormal behaviors emerging during REM sleep that may cause injury or sleep disruption.</br>RBD is also associated with EMG abnormalities during REM sleep.</br>The EMG demonstrates an excess of muscle tone during REM sleep, and/or an excess of phasic EMG twitch activity during REM sleep. </br>A complaint of sleep related injury is common with RBD, which usually manifests as an attempted enactment of unpleasant, action-filled, and violent dreams in which the individual is being confronted, attacked, or chased by unfamiliar people or animals.</br>Typically, at the end of an episode, the individual awakens quickly, becomes rapidly alert, and reports a dream with a coherent story.</br>The dream action corresponds closely to the observed sleep behaviors. </br>Sleep and dream-related behaviors reported by history and documented during vPSG include both violent and (less commonly) nonviolent behaviors: talking (including giving speeches), smiling, laughing, singing, whistling, shouting, swearing profan- ities, crying, chewing, gesturing, reaching, grabbing, arm flailing, clapping, slap- ping, punching, kicking, sitting up, leaping from bed, crawling, running, or dancing.</br>Walking, however, is quite uncommon with RBD, and leaving the room is especially rare, because the eyes are usually closed, precluding attention to the environment.</br>There can be rare occurrences of smoking a fictive cigarette, masturbation-like behav- ior, pelvic thrusting, and mimics of eating, drinking, urinating, and defecating.</br>The eyes usually remain closed during an RBD episode, with the person attending to the dream action and not to the actual environment. </br>Medical attention is usually sought after sleep related injury has occurred to either the person or the bed partner, and rarely because of sleep disruption.</br>Because RBD occurs during REM sleep, it usually appears at least 90 minutes after sleep onset, unless there is coexisting narcolepsy, in which case RBD can emerge shortly after sleep onset during a sleep onset rapid eye movement period (SOREMP).</br>There is an acute form of RBD that emerges during intense REM sleep rebound states, such as during withdrawal from alcohol and sedative-hypnotic agents, or in association with certain medication use, drug intoxication, or relapsing multiple sclerosis. </br>247 Parasomnias Parasomnias Associated Features PLMs during NREM sleep are very common with RBD and may disturb the sleep of the bed partner.</br>Daytime tiredness or sleepiness is uncommon, unless narcolepsy is also present.</br>There is typically no history of irritable, aggressive, or violent behav- ior during the day.</br>There may be a longstanding prodromal history of sleep talking, yelling, limb twitching, and jerking during sleep that may or may not be dream related. </br>Clinical or Pathophysiological Subtypes Parasomnia overlap disorder is a condition in which patients have both RBD and either a disorder of arousal, sleep related eating disorder, sexsomnia, or rhythmic movement disorder.</br>This condition is male predominant, but less so than isolated RBD.</br>Most cases begin during childhood or adolescence.</br>Virtually all age groups can be affected.</br>It can be idiopathic or symptomatic of a broad set of disorders, including narcolepsy, mul- tiple sclerosis, brain tumor (and therapy), rhombencephalitis (right pontine tegmen- tum/medulla lesion), brain trauma, congenital Moebius syndrome, agrypnia excitata, Machado-Joseph disease, various psychiatric disorders and their pharmacotherapies, and substance abuse disorders and withdrawal states. </br>Status dissociatus can be classified as a subtype of RBD that manifests as an extreme form of state dissociation without identifiable sleep stages, but with sleep and dream-related behaviors that closely resemble RBD.</br>Status dissociatus represents a major breakdown of the polysomnographic markers for REM sleep, NREM sleep, and wakefulness, with admixtures of these states being present, but with conventional sleep stages not being identifiable during polysomnographic monitoring.</br>There is abnormal behavioral release that can be associated with disturbed dreaming, strongly suggestive of dream-enacting behaviors that closely resemble RBD.</br>Not uncommonly, the indi- vidual thinks he is awake when observers presume he is asleep and attempting to act out a dream, or vice versa.</br>An underlying neurologic or medical condition, spanning a broad range of pathology, is virtually always present. </br>Dream enactment (“oneirism”) that is REM sleep related or related to a dissociated REM sleep-wakefulness state can be a core feature of a pathologic condition called agrypnia excitata that is characterized by generalized motor overactivity, impaired ability to initiate and maintain sleep (with “wakeful dreaming”), loss of slow wave sleep, and marked motor and autonomic sympathetic activation.</br>Agrypnia excitata is found with such diverse conditions as delirium tremens, Morvan syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia.</br>Thus, agrypnia excitata manifests as both a severe parasomnia and a severe insomnia. </br>248 Demographics RBD is a male predominant disorder that usually emerges after age 50 years.</br>Cases of RBD from early childhood up to age 88 years have been reported.</br>RBD emerging in adults before age 50 years tends to have different demographics and associated features, including greater sex parity and increased rates of idiopathic RBD and para- somnia overlap disorder (POD), comorbid narcolepsy, antidepressant medication use, and possibly autoimmune diseases.</br>In addition, the clinical presentation of RBD in younger adults differs from that in older adults in being less aggressive and violent, presumably due to greater female representation and higher rates of comorbid narco- lepsy (which manifests with milder RBD behaviors). </br>RBD associated with neurologic disorders and other symptomatic forms of RBD are as male predominant as idiopathic RBD, with the exception of narcolepsy (as described below) and multiple system atrophy.</br>Of note, RBD may not be the presenting com- plaint to a sleep disorders center.</br>Therefore, systematic questioning for RBD should be included for all newly evaluated patients at a sleep center.</br>RBD in children is virtually never idiopathic and is usually associated with narcolepsy (at times emerging months before the emergence of narcoleptic symptoms), brainstem tumors, antidepressant medications, neurodevelopmental disorders, and various rare conditions. </br>The prevalence is not known with much certainty, although a prevalence of 0.38% to 0.5% is reported in the elderly and the general population.</br>A 2.1% prevalence of current sleep related violence has been reported; 38% of these events have associated dream enactment, suggesting a prevalence of RBD as high as 0.8%. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors The major predisposing factors are male sex, age 50 years or older, and an under- lying neurological disorder, particularly Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, narcolepsy, or stroke.</br>A recent multicenter case-control study of environmental risk factors of RBD found that smoking, head injury, pesticide exposure, and farming were significant risk factors.</br>Medications, particularly the anti- depressants

. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Onset of chronic RBD can be gradual or rapid, and the course is often progressive.</br>Complications include sleep related injuries to self and/or bed partner that at times are life threatening, and disruption of the bed partner’s sleep that can be severe.</br>Marital discord due to the RBD is uncommon but can be severe when present, due to repeated injury and/or disruption of the bed partner’s sleep. </br>Delayed emergence of a neurodegenerative disorder, often more than a decade after the onset of idiopathic RBD, is very common in men 50 years of age and older.</br>These dis- orders include Parkinson disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).</br>Two recently reported series found 81% and 82% eventual conversion rates from idiopathic RBD to parkinsonism/dementia (and also mild cog- nitive impairment in the latter study).</br>Conversely, RBD is present in &gt;90% of reported cases of MSA, in approximately 50% of reported cases of DLB, and in up to 46% of reported patients with PD. </br>Developmental Issues As stated previously, RBD can emerge in children, usually in association with narco- lepsy-cataplexy, brainstem tumors, or antidepressant medications. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Current evidence suggests a selective association between RBD and neurodegenera- tive disorders.</br>The synucleinopathies comprise a set of neurodegenerative disorders that share a common pathologic lesion composed of aggregates of insoluble α-synu- clein protein in selectively vulnerable populations of neurons and glial cells.</br>These pathologic aggregates appear to be closely linked to the onset and progression of clin- ical symptoms and the degeneration of affected brain regions in neurodegenerative disorders.</br>The major synucleinopathies include PD, DLB, and MSA. </br>RBD can be strongly linked with narcolepsy (almost always narcolepsy type 1), rep- resenting another form of REM sleep motor-behavioral dyscontrol.</br>The

 may be precipitated or worsened by the pharmacologic treatment of cataplexy.</br>RBD associ- ated with narcolepsy is now considered to be a distinct phenotype of RBD, character- ized by lack of sex predominance, less complex and more elementary movements in REM sleep, less violent behavior in REM sleep, earlier age of onset, and hypocretin deficiency (that is characteristic of narcolepsy type 1).</br>The presence of RBD in pediat- ric patients may be an initial manifestation of narcolepsy type 1. </br>Other reported etiologic associations of RBD with neurologic disorders include isch- emic or hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, progressive supranu- clear palsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, brainstem neoplasms (including cerebellopon- tine angle tumors), Machado-Joseph disease (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3), mitochon- drial encephalomyopathy, normal pressure hydrocephalus, Tourette syndrome, group A xeroderma, and autism. </br>The pathophysiology of human RBD is presumed to correspond to the findings from an animal model of RBD with respect to interruption of the REM atonia pathway and/ or disinhibition of brainstem motor pattern generators. </br>Objective Findings Polysomnography demonstrates an excessive amount of sustained or intermittent loss of REM atonia and/or excessive phasic muscle twitch activity of the submental and/or limb EMGs during REM sleep.</br>Some patients have almost exclusively arm and hand behaviors during REM sleep, indicating the need for both upper and lower extremity EMG monitoring in fully evaluating for RBD.</br>Some patients preserve most of their REM atonia but have excessive EMG twitching during REM sleep.</br>The most current evidence-based data for detecting RWA in the evaluation of RBD indicate that any (tonic/phasic) chin EMG activity combined with bilateral phasic activity of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscles in &gt;27% of REM sleep (scored in 30-second epochs) reliably distinguishes RBD patients from controls.</br>Autonomic nervous system activa- tion (such as tachycardia) is uncommon during REM sleep motor activation in RBD, in contrast to the disorders of arousal.</br>Approximately 75% of patients have PLMs during NREM sleep; a low percentage of these movements is associated with EEG signs of arousal.</br>Increased percentages of slow wave sleep and increased delta power in RBD have been found in controlled and uncontrolled studies, but this can be a highly vari- able finding in RBD, depending on the clinical population.</br>Sleep architecture and the customary cycling among REM and NREM sleep stages are usually preserved in RBD, although some patients show a shift toward N1 sleep. </br>Validated RBD screening questionnaires that can assist in the process of diagnosing RBD are currently available. </br>251 Parasomnias Parasomnias Differential Diagnosis RBD is one of several disorders that can manifest as complex, injurious, and violent sleep related and dream-related behaviors in adults.</br>Other disorders that can mimic RBD in adults and/or children include sleepwalking, sleep terrors, OSA, nocturnal seizures (nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy; nocturnal complex partial seizures); rhyth- mic movement disorders; sleep related dissociative disorders, frightening hypnopom- pic hallucinations, and posttraumatic stress disorder; a diagnosis of malingering also should be considered. </br>In general, RBD involves attempted enactment of unpleasant, aggressive dreams that usually occurs two or more hours after sleep onset, with rapid awakening from an episode.</br>In contrast, sleepwalking and sleep terror episodes often emerge within two hours after sleep onset, are not usually associated with rapid alertness, and are rarely associated with dreaming in children.</br>Adults can have dreams associated with disor- ders of arousal, but they are usually more fragmentary and limited than RBD dreams.</br>Sleep related seizures usually present with repetitive, stereotypical behaviors. </br>Parasomnia overlap disorder can be distinguished from status dissociatus in several ways: if there is an awakening after an episode of RBD, sleepwalking, or sleep terror, there is the realization of having just been asleep; status dissociatus, however, is more likely to manifest with confusion over whether one is asleep, awake, or dreaming.</br>vPSG in overlap conditions shows the typical findings for both RBD and disorders of arousal, whereas with status dissociatus, there is an inability to discern sleep stages.</br>Also, patients with status dissociatus do not walk far during an episode, and their behavioral repertoire more closely resembles that of RBD than that of the disorders of arousal. </br>Unresolved Issues and Future Directions Numerous questions related to the vPSG evaluation of RBD remain unresolved.</br>These include issues of defining and quantifying RWA and RBD activity such as: (1) What is the minimum REM sleep percentage of total sleep time (and minimum absolute REM sleep time) needed to diagnose RWA or rule out RWA?</br>(2) What is the minimum number of REM sleep epochs and minimum duration of REM sleep epochs necessary to diagnose RWA or rule out RWA?</br>(3) What guidelines can be developed for diag- nosing or ruling out RWA in the setting of disrupted REM sleep continuity associated with conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea and with medications?</br>(4) What are the minimal amounts of true RBD behaviors documented by vPSG needed to identify RBD in patients without sufficient RWA? </br>252 It is unclear why there is a male predominance of this disorder in middle-aged and older adults.</br>It is unknown if RBD subgroups other than men age 50 years or older demon- strate increased risk for development of parkinsonism or dementia.</br>One such subgroup comprises patients with antidepressant-triggered

A recurrent inability to move the trunk and all of the limbs at sleep onset or upon awakening from sleep. </br>B.

Repeated occurrences of extended, extremely dysphoric, and well- remembered dreams that usually involve threats to survival, security, or physical integrity. </br>B. On awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the person rapidly becomes oriented and alert. </br>C. The dream experience, or the sleep disturbance produced by awakening from it, causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning as indicated by the report of at least one of the following: </br>1.</br>Mood disturbance (e.g., persistence of nightmare affect, anxiety, dysphoria). </br>2. Sleep resistance (e.g., bedtime anxiety, fear of sleep/subsequent nightmares). </br>3. Cognitive impairments (e.g., intrusive nightmare imagery, impaired concentration, or memory). </br>4. Negative impact on caregiver or family functioning (e.g., nighttime disruption). </br>5.</br>Behavioral problems (e.g., bedtime avoidance, fear of the dark). </br>6. Daytime sleepiness. </br>7. Fatigue or low energy. </br>8.</br>Impaired occupational or educational function. </br>9. Impaired interpersonal/social function Notes .</br>Nightmare disorder in children is most likely to occur in those exposed to severe psychosocial stressors.</br>Because childhood nightmares often resolve spontaneously, the diagnosis should be given only if there is persistent distress or impairment. </br>Parasomnias Parasomnias Essential Features Nightmare disorder is characterized by recurrent, highly dysphoric dreams, which are disturbing mental experiences that generally occur during REM sleep and that often result in awakening.</br>Given that these experiences are most often associated with REM sleep, the episodes have a greater tendency to occur during the second half of the major sleep episode when the REM pressure is most pronounced.</br>Nightmares involve an internally generated conscious experience or dream sequence that seems vivid and real.</br>They have a tendency to become increasingly more disturbing as they unfold.</br>Emotions are characteristically negative and most frequently involve anxiety, fear, or terror but may also involve anger, rage, embarrassment, and disgust.</br>Nightmare content most often focuses on imminent physical danger to the individual but may also involve other distressing themes.</br>Ability to detail the nightmare’s contents upon awakening is common in nightmare disorder.</br>Multiple nightmares within a single sleep episode may occur and may bear similar themes.</br>Because nightmares typically arise during REM sleep, they may occur at any moment that REM pressure is high. </br>Nightmares are very common in children.</br>They typically occur in the last third of the night and result in a complete awakening, after which the child can often provide a detailed description of the frightening scenario.</br>However, clear distinction from con- fusional arousals and sleep terrors in young children is often not possible. </br>Associated Features Postawakening anxiety and difficulty returning to sleep may be present.</br>Nightmares are more common in those with higher levels of anxiety.</br>Additionally, nightmares are commonly seen in those who have been physically or sexually abused and in those suf- fering from posttraumatic stress disorder. </br>Nightmares arising either immediately following a trauma (acute stress disorder [ASD]) or one month or more after a trauma (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) have been described during NREM sleep, especially N2, as well as during REM sleep and at sleep onset.</br>Posttraumatic nightmares may take the form of a realistic reliving of a traumatic event or may depict only some of its elements or emotional content. </br>Clinical or Pathophysiological Subtypes None known. </br>Demographics Occasional nightmares are very common in children, occurring in 60% to 75% of chil- dren, beginning as young as 2.5 years of age.</br>The occurrence of occasional nightmares in children does not constitute a nightmare disorder.</br>However, frequent nightmares are uncommon, occurring in 1% to 5% of preadolescent children.</br>It is estimated that 10% to 50% of children aged three to five years have at least occasional nightmares severe enough to disturb their parents.</br>Nightmares appear to be a trait-like characteristic that persists over time during childhood.</br>The best predictor of recurrent nightmares at an older age is recurrent nightmares in childhood.</br>Approximately 2% to 8% of the general population has a current problem with nightmares, and this frequency is higher in clini- cal populations.</br>Trauma-related nightmares are the most consistent problem reported by patients with PTSD.</br>Nightmares beginning within three months of a trauma are present in up to 80% of patients with PTSD.</br>Although approximately 50% of PTSD cases resolve within three months, posttraumatic nightmares may persist throughout life. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Frequent nightmares are associated with enduring personality characteristics and psy- chopathologies; they are inversely correlated with measures of well-being.</br>Associations with psychopathology have been identified for adults and adolescents, but research on children is largely absent other than for assessments of PTSD.</br>Measures of nightmare distress are much more robustly associated with psychopathology than are measures of nightmare frequency. </br>The clinical use of pharmacologic agents affecting the neurotransmitters norepinephrine,

, which is an agent that blocks α-4-β-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. </br>Familial Pattern Twin-based studies have identified persistent genetic predisposition to nightmares in childhood (reported retrospectively by adults) and adulthood as well as genetic influ- ences on the co-occurrence of nightmares and some other parasomnias, such as sleep talking (somniloquy). </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Nightmares usually start between ages three years and six years.</br>The proportion of children reporting nightmares reaches a peak between six and ten years of age and decreases thereafter.</br>A subgroup of children continue to have nightmares into Parasomnias Parasomnias adolescence or adulthood and may become lifelong nightmare sufferers.</br>Nightmares generally diminish in frequency and intensity over the course of decades, but some patients still describe frequent episodes at the age of 60 or 70 years.</br>Nightmare dis- order can lead to sleep avoidance and deprivation, and thereby to more intense night- mares, which can produce insomnia. </br>ASD and PTSD associated nightmares can develop at any age after physical or emo- tional trauma.</br>Individuals with PTSD are at risk for developing mood disorders and depression, social and employment consequences, self-destructive and impulsive behavior, and substance abuse; it is not known to what extent the nightmares symp- tomatic of PTSD contribute to these complications. </br>Developmental Issues As stated above, nightmares are very common in children but the occurrence of occa- sional nightmares does not constitute nightmare disorder.</br>Population studies have revealed that the prevalence and frequency of nightmares increases through childhood into adolescence.</br>For example, preschoolers seldom report “bad dreams.”</br>Furthermore, in regard to the prevalence of nightmares, children appear to exhibit a sex divergence over time, with girls demonstrating higher prevalence by late adolescence. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Not applicable or known. </br>Objective Findings PSG recordings during actual nightmares are few in number and, in some instances, have shown abrupt awakenings from REM sleep preceded by accelerated heart and respiratory rates.</br>Highly disturbing dream content frequently contrasts strikingly with relatively minor autonomic changes.</br>Distinctive anomalies in nightly sleep architec- ture have not been demonstrated; brainstem and auditory-evoked potentials appear normal.</br>Recordings during posttraumatic nightmares are few but have been recorded from both REM and NREM sleep.</br>PSG recordings of sleep in patients with PTSD have provided widely variable results. </br>PSG evaluation is not routinely performed but may be indicated in some circumstances to exclude other parasomnias such as disorders of arousal and sleep-associated sei- zures.</br>A PSG is particularly appropriate if patients report nightmares in conjunction with sleep behaviors that are repetitive or stereotyped or are injurious to self or others. </br>260 Differential Diagnosis Nightmare disorder must be distinguished from dream disturbances associated with certain other neurological and sleep disorders.</br>Rare cases of seizures presenting only as “nightmares” have been reported and should be considered in the differential diagno- sis, particularly in those patients who present with a history of central nervous system disease.</br>PSG or continuous video EEG may be necessary to identify nightmares asso- ciated with nocturnal seizures.</br>Nightmares differ from sleep terrors in having detailed recollection of dreaming in contrast to fragments of dreams or no dream recall, pre- senting no or minimal overt movement or autonomic activity, occurring late in the night, being followed by rapid awakening and difficulty returning to sleep, and most often arising from REM sleep.</br>RBD occurs more often in late middle-aged men and is more often associated with violent explosive movements and a history of nocturnal injuries.</br>The dream disturbance of RBD usually involves being threatened or attacked by unfamiliar people or animals and is controlled in tandem with the sleep behavioral disturbance by appropriate medication.</br>Nightmares occur at any age and are not typ- ically associated with movements, overt behaviors, or injuries.</br>Anxiety may accom- pany episodes of sleep paralysis occurring either at sleep onset (hypnagogic) or offset (hypnopompic), when the individual feels conscious but unable to move, speak, and, at times, breathe properly.</br>Anxiety may be further worsened if disturbing hypnago- gic hallucinations or dream sequences accompany the paralysis.</br>Nightmares, although they may involve some degree of movement inhibition or some degree of apparent wakefulness, are usually not accompanied by feelings of either total paralysis or com- plete waking consciousness. </br>Patients with narcolepsy often report nightmares; these may occur at sleep onset.</br>However, narcolepsy and nightmare disorder are clearly distinguishable by other clinical symptoms.</br>Nocturnal panic attacks occur either during or immediately after nocturnal awakenings from NREM sleep, usually in the first four hours of the sleep episode.</br>Although frequency of panic attacks is correlated with frequency of night- mares and many patients report that dysphoric dreams precede their attacks, there may be no dream recall reported on awakening with a panic attack. </br>Sleep related dissociative disorders comprise a sleep related variant of the dissociative disorders as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V).</br>These include dissociative identity disorder (formerly called multi- ple personality disorder) and dissociative fugue, in which individuals meeting waking criteria for these diagnoses may at times experience the recall of actual physical or emotional trauma as a “dream” during periods of EEG-documented nocturnal waking. Parasomnias Parasomnias Nightmares that occur intermittently during the course of ASD or PTSD are an expected symptom of those mental disorders and do not always require independent coding as nightmare disorder.</br>However, as is often the case, when the frequency and/or severity of posttraumatic nightmares is such that they require independent clinical attention, then a diagnosis of nightmare disorder should be applied.</br>In some cases, other symp- toms of PTSD may have largely resolved while the nightmares persist.</br>Nightmare disorder should be coded in these cases as well.</br>It is clinically important to establish whether nightmares are associated with PTSD or ASD because the evaluation, course, complications, and treatment differ significantly for these groups. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Basic pathophysiologic studies are still needed, especially studies contrasting “idio- pathic” nightmare disorder and nightmares associated with PTSD.</br>In particular, deter- mining whether posttraumatic nightmares arise from sleep or primarily from wakeful- ness would be an important distinguishing feature particularly when determining effec- tive clinical interventions.</br>The PSG correlates of nightmare disorder and posttraumatic nightmares as well as the variables affecting dream mentation and recall require further definition and delineation. </br>The distinction between nightmares and sleep terrors is difficult when assessed only by questionnaires.</br>It still remains unclear to what degree and level of complexity sleep mentation is associated with sleep terrors.</br>The topic of NREM sleep dream distur- bances (other than disturbed mentation that may occur with sleep terrors) also needs formal investigation, including whether or not the term NREM sleep nightmare should be utilized. </br>The optimal methods for assessing nightmare frequency and nightmare distress are still unclear.</br>Standardized scales assessing nightmare distress should be developed and utilized.</br>Retrospective questionnaire-based evaluations of nightmares are problematic inasmuch as they underestimate nightmare frequencies relative to home logs, whereas home logs may selectively increase recall of nightmares. </br>Bibliography Germain A, Nielsen T.

There is a complaint of a sudden loud noise or sense of explosion in the head either at the wake-sleep transition or upon waking during the night. </br>B. The individual experiences abrupt arousal following the event, often with a sense of fright. </br>C. The experience is not associated with significant complaints of pain. </br>Essential Features Exploding head syndrome is characterized by a sudden, loud imagined noise or sense of a violent explosion in the head occurring as the patient is falling asleep or waking during the night. </br>The event is variously described as a painless loud bang, an explosion, a clash of cymbals, or a bomb exploding, but occasionally may be a less alarming sound.</br>It is usually associated with a sense of fright, and many patients believe they are having a stroke.</br>In a minority of cases a flash of light or myoclonic jerk may accompany the event.</br>The abnormal sensation lasts a few seconds and may recur during further attempts at sleeping.</br>The number of attacks varies—from many on a single night to infrequent—with some patients reporting clustering of attacks over several nights fol- lowed by a gap of weeks to months.</br>A high level of clinical distress can be associated with recurrent attacks, with concern about their underlying cause. </br>Associated Features A flash of light may accompany the sound, and a myoclonic jerk may sometimes occur.</br>Although the event is typically painless, a simultaneous stab of pain in the head has occasionally been reported.</br>An insomnia complaint may develop as a result of the recurring arousals and anxiety regarding the events. </br>264 Clinical or Pathophysiological Subtypes None known. </br>Demographics The prevalence is unknown.</br>Exploding head syndrome is reported to be more common in women than in men.</br>The median age of onset is 58 years, but onset at all ages has been reported, including the first and eighth decades. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Most patients do not detect precipitating factors, but some report increased numbers of attacks when under personal stress or overtired. </br>Familial Pattern Occasional cases of exploding head syndrome occurring in the same family have been reported, although it is not clear whether this represents a true familial pattern. </br>Onset, Course, and Complication The course is benign with no reported neurologic sequelae.</br>Frequent events on a single night can result in insomnia.</br>Clinical levels of anxiety may result from patient concern about a serious medical basis for the exploding head syndrome.</br>The condition may also exacerbate a comorbid migraine disorder.</br>In many patients, the symptoms appear to remit spontaneously over some years. </br>Developmental Issues Not known or applicable. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The events occur most frequently during a period of drowsiness preceding sleep.</br>Some events are reported to occur upon waking during the night, but may actually be occur- ring during reinitiating sleep.</br>The condition appears to be a sensory variant of the better-known transient motor phenomenon of sleep starts or hypnic jerks occurring at wake-sleep transition.</br>The neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying these hypnago- gic phenomena are unknown. </br>Objective Findings VPSG in a small sample of patients found that events arose from early drowsiness with predominant alpha rhythm interspersed with some theta activity.</br>In one patient, events arose during transition from N1 sleep, in another patient from N1 sleep to wakeful- ness, and in a third patient from N2 sleep to wakefulness.</br>Events occurring in the N1/ Parasomnias Parasomnias N2 to wake transition have been recorded during both nocturnal vPSG and MSLTs.</br>Slow eye movements were present in the only tracing reproduced in the report of a patient with exploding head syndrome emerging during wake to N1 sleep transition.</br>

The hallucinations are predominantly visual. </br>C. The disturbance is not better explained by another sleep disorder (especially narcolepsy), mental disorder, medical disorder, medication, or substance use. </br>Essential Features Sleep related hallucinations are hallucinatory experiences that occur at sleep onset or on awakening from sleep.</br>Sleep related hallucinations are predominantly visual but may include auditory, tactile, or kinetic phenomena.</br>Hallucinations at sleep onset (hypnagogic hallucinations) may be difficult to differentiate from sleep onset dream- ing.</br>Hallucinations on waking in the morning (hypnopompic hallucinations) may arise out of a period of REM sleep, and patients also may be uncertain whether they rep- resent waking or dream-related experiences.</br>Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations may represent a distinct form of sleep related hallucinations.</br>They typically occur fol- lowing a sudden awakening, without recall of a preceding dream.</br>They usually take the form of complex, vivid, relatively immobile images of people or animals, sometimes distorted in shape or size.</br>These hallucinations may remain present for many minutes but usually disappear if ambient illumination is increased.</br>Patients are clearly awake but often initially perceive the hallucinations as real and frightening. </br>Associated Features Sleep related hallucinations may be associated with episodes of sleep paralysis, either at the same time or on different nights.</br>Patients with complex nocturnal visual hal- lucinations may jump out of the bed in terror, sometimes injuring themselves.</br>Some patients may experience other parasomnias, such as sleep talking or sleepwalking, sep- arate from the hallucinations; some patients may also experience similar complex hal- lucinations during the day, unassociated with sleep. </br>Parasomnias Parasomnias Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Dream-like hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations appear to differ in clini- cal features and pathogenesis from complex nocturnal visual hallucinations arising in wakefulness after sudden arousals during the night.</br>Sleep related hallucinations are common in narcolepsy and also occur as occasional phenomena in a high per- centage of the general population.</br>In contrast, complex nocturnal visual hallucina- tions appear to be rare and occur in the setting of a range of neurologic and visual disorders (see Differential Diagnosis) as well as in an idiopathic form.</br>However, further work is needed to establish whether or not these forms of hallucinations represent different entities. </br>Demographics In large European population studies, sleep related hallucinations have been reported to occur with a prevalence of 25% to 37% for hypnagogic hallucinations, whereas the equivalent reported prevalence for hypnopompic hallucinations is 7% to 13%.</br>Both hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations are more common in younger persons and occur slightly more frequently in women than in men. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Multivariate analyses in large population studies have suggested that sleep related hal- lucinations are associated with younger age, current drug use, past alcohol use, anxiety, mood disorder, sleep onset insomnia, and perceived insufficient sleep. </br>Familial Pattern Not applicable or known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Sleep related hallucinations appear to be more common in adolescence and early adult- hood.</br>In many patients, the frequency appears to decrease with age.</br>The natural history of complex nocturnal visual hallucinations depends on the underlying cause. </br>Developmental Issues Not known or applicable. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology It is presumed that most sleep related hallucinations are due to dream ideation of REM sleep intruding into wakefulness, but this has not been firmly established.</br>Infrequent hallucinations of this type may be within the limits of normal sleep-wake transition.</br>Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations may in some cases be release phenomena in which loss of visual input or decreased reticular activating system activity results in the visual cortex generating aberrant images. </br>Objective Findings Hypnagogic hallucinations appear to arise predominantly from sleep onset REM periods.</br>However, the very few reports of polysomnography in complex nocturnal visual hallucinations suggest an onset from NREM sleep.</br>MRI scans of the brain, PSG, EEG, and neuropsychological testing may help in the differential diagnosis and in identifying underlying disorders. </br>Differential Diagnosis Nightmares are frightening dreams awakening the patient from sleep.</br>They are clearly recognized as dreams and do not persist into wakefulness.</br>Exploding head syndrome consists of a sudden sensation of an explosion in the head, usually at sleep onset and sometimes accompanied by a noise or flash of light.</br>It does not involve complex visual imagery and lasts only seconds.</br>In RBD, the patient acts out dreams during REM sleep.</br>If not awakened by an observer, the person usually has little recollection of dream content.</br>Sleepwalking may occasionally be associated with dream ideation, but the patient recognizes that the dream occurred during sleep.</br>Visual hallucinations can be due to epileptic seizures but are usually brief, stereotyped, and fragmentary in such cases.</br>Occasionally, complex visual hallucinations may be associated with migraine but are usually followed by a headache. </br>Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations may be seen in patients with narcolepsy, PD, DLB, visual loss (Charles Bonnet hallucinations), and midbrain and diencephalic pathology (peduncular hallucinosis), as well as with the use of

The patient exhibits recurrent involuntary voiding during sleep, occurring at least twice a week. </br>C. The condition has been present for at least three months. </br>D.</br>The patient has never been consistently dry during sleep. </br>Secondary Sleep Enuresis – Criteria A-D must be met A.</br>The patient is older than five years. </br>B. The patient exhibits recurrent involuntary voiding during sleep, occurring at least twice a week. </br>C. The condition has been present for at least three months. </br>D.</br>The patient has previously been consistently dry during sleep for at least six months.</br> Essential Features Sleep enuresis (SE) is characterized by recurrent involuntary voiding that occurs during sleep.</br>In primary SE, recurrent involuntary voiding occurs at least twice a week during sleep after five years of age in a patient who has never been consistently dry during sleep for six consecutive months.</br>SE is considered secondary in a child or adult who had previously been dry for six consecutive months and then began wetting at least twice a week.</br>Both primary and secondary enuresis must be present for a period of at least three months.</br>Though primary and secondary enuresis share the common symptom of voiding during sleep, they are understood as distinct phenomena with different etiologies. </br>SE is associated with difficulty arousing from sleep in response to an urge to urinate and may occur during any sleep stage.</br>Sleep disorders that fragment sleep such as sleep apnea are associated with SE, and treatment of these disorders may cure or reduce their incidence. </br>Associated Features Involuntary voiding during wakefulness may be associated with SE and, if present, generally points toward a physiological etiology.</br>Psychosocial problems are consid- ered a relatively rare cause in primary SE, though it does occur more commonly in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and in children living in disorga- nized families.</br>Secondary SE is seen more commonly in children who have recently experienced a significant psychosocial stress, such as parental divorce, physical or sexual abuse, or neglect.</br>Chronic constipation and encopresis (fecal soiling) often occur in children with secondary SE. </br>SE can occur in association with diabetes and urinary tract infection.</br>It may occur in individuals with nocturnal epilepsy.</br>Among older adults, SE may be associated with symptoms of congestive heart failure, OSA, depression, and dementia. </br>SRBD is reported in 8% to 47% of children with enuresis, compared to an overall prev- alence of 1% to 2%.</br>PLMS have been reported in patients with refractory SE.</br>A large epidemiology study of children aged 6-10 years found that a current complaint of SE was significantly associated with increased ORs (2.7-3.4) for subjectively high arousal threshold, night terrors, nocturia, and confusion when awakened from sleep.</br>Other studies have found mouth breathing, nasal congestion, snoring, and restless sleep to be highly related to enuresis in children. </br>271 Parasomnias Parasomnias Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes The most important distinction is between primary and secondary SE. </br>Demographics SE occurs in 15% to 20% of 5-year-olds.</br>It is three times more common in boys than in girls.</br>SE is reported by 2.1% of community-dwelling older adults and is more common among women than men. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors The etiology of SE is complex.</br>The factors that precipitate SE on a particular night and at a particular time remain unknown.</br>One popular model hypothesizes that SE consists of three interrelated factors: large nocturnal urine volume production, noc- turnal bladder overactivity, and difficulty arousing from sleep.</br>Several studies suggest difficulty arousing from sleep is most important in primary enuresis, whereas bladder instability/overactivity is more important in secondary enuresis. </br>Children with enuresis are often described by their families as “deep sleepers” and very difficult to arouse.</br>A high arousal threshold has been objectively confirmed in these children. </br>It has been reported that fragmentation of sleep by disorders such as sleep apnea is highly correlated with SE.</br>Sleep fragmenting disorders such as sleep apnea and PLMS have been previously reported to be proximal triggers for the occurrence of disorders of arousal—sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors.</br>Successful treatment of sleep apnea in these disorders has been reported to result in reduction or elimination of disorders of arousal.</br>Similarly, surgical treatment of sleep apneas by adenotonsillec- tomy has been reported to cure nocturnal enuresis in 60% or more of patients, although this is not a consistent result.</br>Several studies have noted the presence of sleep related breathing disorder in &gt; 40% of enuresis patients studied.</br>However, not all sleep studies have noted SRBD in patients with enuresis.</br>Those without SRBD were still found to have high arousal threshold from sleep. </br>Primary SE is a disorder that occurs when an individual fails to arouse from sleep in response to bladder sensations or fails to inhibit a bladder contraction.</br>These are devel- opmentally acquired skills, and, as such, there is a range in the ages of their acquisition.</br>A small proportion of children with primary SE lack the normal increase in vasopressin release during sleep, leading to a high urinary volume that exceeds the bladder capac- ity.</br>If these children do not arouse to the sensation of a full bladder, primary SE is the result.</br>Secondary SE can be caused by, or be associated with, any one of the following identifiable problems: (1) an inability to concentrate urine due to diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (idiopathic or pharmacologic</br>[e.g., secondary to the use of

SE to a region on chromosomes 22q, 13q, and 12q across different families has been reported. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Voiding is a spinal reflex during wakefulness and sleep during infancy, until about 18 months of age.</br>Between 18 months and three years of age, the child is able to delay voiding with a full bladder, first during wakefulness and at a later age during sleep.</br>The primary determinant of the age at which this skill is acquired is developmental matura- tion.</br>Somewhat arbitrarily, primary SE is defined as a problem if it persists beyond five years of age.</br>The spontaneous cure rate is 15% per year.</br>The primary complication of SE is to the child’s self-esteem.</br>How well the child’s family deals with the symptom is an important determinant of whether complications develop.</br>Secondary SE can occur at any age.</br>Complications of secondary SE are determined by the problem leading to the enuresis. </br>Developmental Issues The developmental pattern of enuresis is similar to NREM parasomnias, although its first occurrence in adulthood is uncommon. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology SE is a heterogeneous disorder with various underlying pathophysiological mecha- nisms, resulting in a mismatch between nocturnal bladder capacity and the amount of Parasomnias Parasomnias urine produced during sleep, in association with a simultaneous failure of arousal from sleep in response to the sensation of bladder fullness.</br>SE can be seen in association with sleep fragmentation disorders including SRBD, which in children is most often secondary to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. </br>Objective Findings In primary and secondary SE, enuretic episodes can occur in all sleep stages, during nocturnal wakefulness, and in association with transient arousals.</br>Sleep stages have not been found to be different on nights when enuresis occurs versus nights on which it does not occur.</br>The results of polysomnographic studies of children with enuresis com- pared to normal controls have been inconsistent.</br>A computerized power analysis of sleep data suggested an increase in delta power, whereas the majority of other studies have reported no differences.</br>However, a recent study found those age 6-14 years had elevated light stage N1 sleep and reduced N3 sleep and REM sleep compared to normal controls.</br>The population with enuresis had a significantly elevated arousal index. </br>SRBD has been reported in 8% to 47% of children with SE.</br>SE and sleep apnea are highly correlated with an increasing prevalence of enuresis as the respiratory distur- bance index (RDI) increases.</br>In addition to SRBD, PLMS (range of 3.9 to 38.6 per hour of sleep) have been reported in a group of children with treatment-resistant SE. </br>Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with enuresis are subjectively sleepier than normal controls.</br>This has been hypothesized to result from fragmented nocturnal sleep and is consistent with a large body of sleep research in other areas. </br>Differential Diagnosis Enuresis may be caused by a variety of medical or neurological disorders such as diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, epilepsy, sickle cell disease, bowel or bladder dysfunction, anatomical abnormalities or infection of the urinary tract, neurological/ developmental disorders or other sleep disorders, especially OSA.</br>Organic pathology of the urinary tract is more prevalent in children who, in addition to sleep enuresis, also exhibit daytime enuresis, abnormalities in the initiation of micturition, or abnormal urinary flow. </br>Evaluation of sleep enuresis should include complete enuresis history, sleep history, physical examination and laboratory studies (as indicated) to exclude these etiol- ogies.</br>When signs and symptoms of sleep apnea are present—mouth breathing, snoring, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, daytime sleepiness, hyperactivity—a sleep study should be conducted. </br>274 Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Recent advances suggest that the terms primary and secondary enuresis may be overly simplistic.</br>Further work is necessary to understand the genetic and clinical aspects of SE. </br>Other sleep disorders are common in children with SE.</br>Though it may be possible that the apneas, hypopneas, and snoring-related arousals in children with SRBD could be the trigger of SE, many children with SE do not have a sleep disorder.</br>In such cases, the underlying bladder overactivity may be the stimulus for arousal. </br>Studies of the relationship of sleep, sleep disorders, and sleep fragmentation to SE performed to date have been inconsistent.</br>This is likely due to differing definitions of enuresis and varying research methodologies.</br>Further sophisticated sleep laboratory studies are necessary to elucidate the relationship.</br>In particular, the proximal trigger for episodes of SE has not been determined.</br>Some studies suggest enuresis is sponta- neous, whereas others suggest a relationship to sleep disorders that result in arousals— similar to findings in disorders of arousal.

For children, the description of these symptoms should be in the child’s own words. </br>3.</br>When symptoms are very severe, relief by activity may not be noticeable but must have been previously present. </br>4.</br>As a result of severity, treatment intervention, or treatment-induced augmentation, the worsening in the evening or night may not be noticeable but must have been previously present. </br>5.</br>For certain research applications, such as genetic or epidemiological studies, it may be appropriate to omit criterion C.</br>If so, this should be clearly stated in the research report. </br>Essential Features RLS is a sensorimotor disorder characterized by a complaint of a strong, nearly irresist- ible urge to move the limbs.</br>This urge to move is often but not always accompanied by other uncomfortable sensations felt deep inside the limbs or by a feeling that is simply difficult or impossible to describe.</br>Although the legs are most prominently affected, “restless legs” is a misnomer, in that 21% to 57% of individuals with RLS describe some arm sensations.</br>The most common adult RLS descriptors in English are “rest- less,” “uncomfortable,” “twitchy,” “need to stretch,” “urge to move,” and “legs want to move on their own.”</br>About half express their RLS sensations as painful.</br>“Numb” and “cold” are very uncommon descriptors for RLS. Criteria A1-3 specify the necessary characteristics of the RLS sensations: worse at rest, better with movement, and predominant occurrence in the evening or night.</br>The separation of worsening at rest (criterion A1) from worsening in the evening/ night (criterion A3) is based on circadian rhythm studies that show an increase at night, independent of activity level.</br>RLS must be differentiated from other condi- tions that can mimic RLS (criterion B).</br>Clinically significant RLS is defined by RLS symptoms causing substantial distress, sleep disturbance, or impairment of function (criterion C). </br>Associated Features Disturbed sleep is a common, prominent, and distressing aspect of RLS.</br>Sleep onset and maintenance complaints in individuals with RLS are notably higher than in con- trols, with odds ratios (OR) between 1.7 and 3.5.</br>In clinical populations, disturbed Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders sleep is reported in 60% to 90% of individuals with RLS, is typically the most trou- bling symptom, and is often the primary reason for seeking medical care.</br>The Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Questionnaire scores for sleep quantity, sleep disturbance, sleep adequacy, and sleep problems are significantly worse for RLS patients than con- trols.</br>Daytime fatigue and daytime sleepiness are also common complaints; however, the sleepiness is not as severe as expected for the degree of sleep disruption, implying hyperarousal in RLS.</br>In contrast to obstructive sleep apnea, Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores in RLS are typically in the normal range, and either no different or marginally elevated when compared to normal controls.</br>Clinical sleep disturbance correlates with both severity of RLS and health impact of RLS.</br>Some individuals with RLS may choose to work at night, thereby shifting quiet activities and their sleep schedule away from the circadian peak of their RLS symptoms. PLMs, a family history of RLS, and response to dopaminergic therapy are supportive of the diagnosis.</br>Periodic limb movements can occur in sleep (PLMS) or wakeful- ness (PLMW).</br>PLMW occur during quiet rest and frequently at the transition between waking and sleep, disrupting sleep onset or the return to sleep.</br>PLMS are frequently associated with arousal from sleep.</br>RLS sensory and motor features respond initially to treatment with dopaminergic therapy in almost all cases. </br>Multiple clinic-based and population-based studies have shown an increased preva- lence of mood and anxiety disorders in individuals with RLS.</br>Most controlled studies using validated assessments have shown significantly increased ORs for moderately or highly elevated depressive symptoms (OR 1.95 and 3.67), major depression (OR 2.6), major depressive disorder (OR 2.57 and 4.7), generalized anxiety disorder (OR 3.5), panic disorder (OR 4.7, 12.9, and 18.9), and posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 3.76).</br>In addition, a positive correlation has been found between the severity of RLS and depression/anxiety symptoms.</br>Relevant to the RLS-depression relationship is the emerging evidence that treatment of RLS improves depressive symptoms. </br>Similarly, increased rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been found in RLS, both in pediatric and adult studies.</br>Emerging data indicate that about one fourth of individuals with RLS have ADHD symptoms, and conversely, that 12% to 35% of those with ADHD meet criteria for RLS.</br>Other medical condi- tions for which there is some evidence for greater-than-chance association include narcolepsy, migraine, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes melli- tus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, nocturnal eating, obesity, thyroid disease, and heart disease. </br>284 Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Evidence in the literature is not sufficient to support well-defined subtypes of RLS.</br>Early-onset RLS (prior to age 45 years) is more familial and associated with slower progression than late-onset RLS.</br>In addition, the classification of “secondary” RLS has been suggested when the condition occurs in association with iron deficiency, preg- nancy, and chronic renal failure, but this construct has been challenged based on patho- physiological, family history, genetic, and clinical course data. </br>Demographics The overall prevalence of RLS has been estimated at 5% to 10% in European and North American population-based studies.</br>However, in Asian countries, studies thus far indicate a lower prevalence.</br>Prevalence is about twice as high in women than in men.</br>In most studies, prevalence increases with age up to 60-70 years, except in Asian populations where an age-related increase has not been found.</br>Various measures of clinical significance such as frequency (1-2 times/week), severity (moderate to severe distress), differential diagnosis, and impact have been applied to population-based studies.</br>These analyses indicate the prevalence of clinically significant RLS to be 2% to 3% in Europe and North America, but lower in Asia.</br>Annual incidence rates have been reported as 0.8% to 2.2%. </br>Pediatric prevalence rates are 2% to 4% in UK/US and Turkish studies, with moderate to severe RLS in about 0.5% to 1%.</br>Adolescents are more likely to have moderate to severe RLS symptoms than younger children—one half of 12- to 17-year-olds com- pared to one fourth of 8- to 11-year-olds with RLS.</br>Boys are affected as often as girls, with the sex difference not emerging until the late teens or twenties. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors A positive family history of RLS, the genetic variants noted below, and female sex confer increased risk for RLS.</br>The best characterized precipitating factors are iron deficiency, certain medications, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, and prolonged immo- bility.</br>Mild iron deficiency, characterized by serum ferritin below 50 μg/L, has been associated with increased severity of RLS, and repletion of iron stores from below 50-75 μg/L has been found to diminish RLS symptoms.</br>Medications that may precip- itate or aggravate RLS and/or PLMS include sedating

, tobacco, or alcohol as exacerbating factors for RLS. </br>Familial Patterns Early-onset RLS is highly familial, with 40% to 92% of cases reporting affected family members.</br>High concordance rates are observed in monozygotic twins.</br>The risk of RLS is two to six times greater for first-degree relatives of patients with RLS than for those from the general population.</br>Although an autosomal dominant model of RLS is sug- gested by many family studies, recent genomewide linkage and association studies suggest a more complex gene-environment pattern.</br>Linkage analyses have reported several different gene loci associated with RLS but, to date, no single causative gene.</br>However, genomewide association studies have identified single nucleotide poly- morphisms in RLS, four of which have been replicated: BTBD9, MEIS1, MAP2K5/ LBXCOR, and PTPRD.</br>Nonetheless, the relationship between familial RLS and these findings remains to be determined. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Onset of RLS symptoms occurs at all ages, from childhood to late adult life.</br>Mean age of onset for familial RLS is in the third or fourth decade, with onset prior to age 21 years in about one third of cases.</br>The clinical course of RLS differs based on age of onset.</br>In early-onset RLS (before age 45 years), slow progression of symptoms is found in about two thirds of cases.</br>Most of the remaining one third report stable symp- toms over time, although remission has been described.</br>In late-onset RLS, rapid pro- gression is typical and aggravating factors are common. </br>286 Significant impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been found in moderate to severe RLS.</br>Both physical health and mental health scores have consis- tently been found to be lower for individuals with RLS, using standard QoL assess- ment tools.</br>The HRQoL impairments are strongly associated with severity of RLS and remain after controlling for age, sex, and disease comorbidity.</br>In addition, patients with cancer, type 2 diabetes, or renal failure who also have RLS have been shown to have poorer quality of life than those without RLS.</br>Overall, RLS accounts for a major disease burden on those who suffer from it, demonstrated to be similar to or worse than that associated with osteoarthritis, congestive heart failure, depression, Parkinson disease, or stroke. </br>Large population-based studies have found positive associations between RLS and cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease and stroke.</br>Repetitive surges in heart rate and blood pressure associated with PLMS are a potential mediator in the physiology of these relationships.</br>Only limited mortality data are available, suggesting increased risk of mortality in women and in chronic renal failure patients with RLS. </br>Developmental Issues The accurate diagnosis of RLS in children and adolescents requires understanding of developmental language and cognitive skills.</br>Adequate verbal skills are needed for children to communicate the sensory component of RLS and description must be in “the child’s own words,” rather than by a parent or caretaker.</br>For criterion A, children rarely use or understand the word “urge.”</br>Instead they describe that their legs “need to” “have to” or “got to” move.</br>Descriptors for the discomfort include: bugs, ants, weird/ funny feelings, tingle, wiggly, and shaky.</br>Younger children often use the word “kick” rather than “move,” e.g., “my legs want to kick.”</br>Similar to adults, children report arm involvement in almost half of cases.</br>Sitting in class, lying in bed, reading a book, and riding in a car are situations where children report onset or worsening of their symp- toms.</br>Relief is typically achieved by moving around, walking, rubbing, kicking, or distraction.</br>Perhaps as a result of prolonged periods of sitting in class, two thirds of children and adolescents with RLS report daytime leg sensations.</br>Because of this, for diagnostic criterion A3 (worse in the evening/night), it is important to compare equal duration of sitting or lying down in the day to sitting or lying down in the evening/ night.</br>However, even with such comparisons, a significant subset of children do not report worsening at evening/night, yet meet all other diagnostic criteria and have sup- portive features for RLS, including a positive family history.</br>Children who are age six years or older and developmentally normal have been shown to report detailed, ade- quate descriptors for RLS symptoms.</br>For children who are too young to adequately describe RLS sensations or are developmentally delayed, a PLMD diagnosis may be Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders the initial diagnosis, with full RLS symptomatology evident over time.</br>Diagnosis by observational techniques has been suggested but not yet validated. </br>The differential diagnosis of pediatric RLS includes positional discomfort, sore leg muscles, joint/tendon injury, and bruises, all of which are common mimics.</br>In child- hood, RLS is frequently misdiagnosed as “growing pains.”</br>Four specific domains that are affected in pediatric RLS are sleep, daily activities, mood, and energy/vital- ity.</br>Difficulties with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and sleep quality are common.</br>Negative influence of RLS on waking activities includes academic impact due to dis- ruption of schoolwork, homework, and ability to concentrate.</br>Severity assessment of pediatric RLS has thus far been limited to simple measures of self-reported frequency and intensity. </br>Because pediatric RLS is highly familial, the presence of RLS in a first-degree rela- tive helps to increase diagnostic certainty in childhood RLS.</br>Similarly, the presence of PLMS or a history of PLMD is quite helpful in supporting an RLS diagnosis in chil- dren.</br>As in adults, approximately 70% of children with RLS demonstrate PLMS ≥ 5/ hour on a single night and nearly 90% when multiple nights are sampled.</br>PLMS ≥ 5/ hour are uncommon in pediatric normative samples.</br>As noted above, pediatric RLS is comorbid with ADHD in about one fourth of cases, and, as in adults, higher rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms are found.</br>RLS is common in pediatric chronic kidney disease. </br>Prevalence rates of RLS increase with age until late adulthood then stabilize or decrease slightly in the elderly.</br>However, strong associations with anxiety, mood disorders, and decreased QoL measures remain in the elderly.</br>Diagnostic criteria for RLS in the cog- nitive-impaired elderly have been suggested but not validated.

 regulation, and genetics appear to be primary factors in the pathophysiology of RLS.</br>Iron is important in brain dopa- mine production and synaptic density, as well as in myelin synthesis and energy pro- duction.</br>A connection between RLS and low brain iron is supported by autopsy data, MRI, brain sonography, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis.</br>Evidence for central nervous system dopaminergic system involvement comes mainly from multiple randomized clinical trials that have clearly demonstrated the effect of dopaminergic drugs for RLS and PLMS.</br>In addition, an altered dopaminergic profile in RLS is supported by func- tional MRI, positron emission tomography, and autopsy data.</br>Association of gene vari- ants BTBD9, MEIS1, MAP2K5/LBXCOR, and PTPRD with RLS has been replicated, indicating a genetic substrate upon which environmental factors might act.</br>BTBD9 is estimated to confer a population attributable risk (PAR) of 50% for RLS.</br>Together, BTBD9, MEIS1, and MAP2K5/LBXCOR account for 70% of the PAR for RLS in indi- viduals with European ancestry.</br>Thus far, two of the variants, BTBD9 and MEIS1, appear to influence expression of PLMS, as well as iron homeostasis.</br>However, the full role of RLS gene variants has not been adequately defined. </br>Objective Findings Although polysomnography is not routinely indicated in the evaluation of RLS, poly- somnographic studies demonstrate significant objective sleep abnormalities in RLS, with increased latency to persistent sleep and higher arousal index as the most consis- tent differences in sleep architecture.</br>PLMS ≥5/hour occur in 70% to 80% of adults with RLS on single-night testing but in &gt;90% when multiple nights are sampled.</br>In adult RLS, PLMS are more prominent during the first half of the night and vary in frequency from night to night.</br>About one third of PLMS are associated with cortical arousals, and most have associated autonomic arousals.</br>PLMS are not influenced by

-receptor antagonists.</br>Painful legs and moving toes have neither a clear circadian pattern nor the sense of an urge to move. </br>Pain involving the legs occurs with numerous conditions, including arthritis, vascular problems, sports/orthopedic injuries, and neuropathy.</br>These pains can have a nocturnal presentation and may be worse at rest, but improvement with movement either does not occur or entails more exercise than simple movement of the leg.</br>The urge to move, if present at all, usually stems from awareness that movement produces relief rather than the strong primary urgency of movement felt with RLS.</br>The presence of pain, however, does not exclude a diagnosis of RLS, because about 50% of patients with RLS report their RLS symptoms as painful. </br>Although it is important that RLS symptoms not be attributable solely to another medical or behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any of these mimics can occur in an individual who also has RLS.</br>For example, some subjects may have both RLS and leg cramps.</br>When the diagnosis of RLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features such as the presence of PLMS or a family history of RLS may be helpful.</br>Diagnostic interviews that include differential diagnosis have been validated for RLS.</br>These demonstrate sensitivity and specificity of &gt; 90%. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions The diagnosis of RLS relies on the subjective report of sensory symptoms that lie outside the range of common sensory experience.</br>Many patients have difficulty describing the sensations.</br>Further studies of the biological bases for RLS may lead to better classification of RLS and possibly to objective tests for diagnosis.</br>Iron, dopa- mine, and genetic research hold particular promise.</br>Additional epidemiological and genetic studies outside the US and Europe are needed to explore apparent population differences.</br>The diagnostic standards and severity assessment for children and cogni- tively impaired adults require further development.</br>Clarification of the natural course and potential exacerbating factors is needed.</br>Better understanding of RLS with comor- bidities such as mood disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder might lead to improved outcomes in those disorders.</br>Further evaluation of long-term complica- tions is important, including clarification of associations with hypertension, cardiovas- cular disease, and stroke. </br>Bibliography Allen R, Picchietti D, Hening W, et al.</br>Restless legs syndrome: diagnostic criteria, special considerations, and epidemiology.</br>A report from the restless legs syndrome diagnosis and epidemiology workshop at the National Institutes of Health.</br>Sleep Med 2003;4:101–19. </br>Allen RP, Stillman P, Myers AJ.</br>Physician-diagnosed restless legs syndrome in a large sample of primary medical care patients in western Europe: Prevalence and characteristics.</br>Sleep Med 2010;11:31–7. </br>Dauvilliers Y, Winkelmann J.

The presence of insomnia or hypersomnia with PLMS is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of PLMD.</br>Studies have shown that in most cases the cause of the accompanying insomnia or hypersomnia is something other than the PLMS.</br>To establish the diagnosis of PLMD, it is essential to establish a reasonable cause-and-effect relationship between the insomnia or hypersomnia and the PLMS.</br>This requires that other causes of insomnia such as anxiety or other causes of hypersomnia such as obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy are ruled out.</br>PLMS are common, but PLMD is thought to be rare in adults. </br>4. PLMD cannot be diagnosed in the context of RLS, narcolepsy, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, or REM sleep behavior disorder; PLMS occur commonly in these conditions but the sleep complaint is more readily ascribed to the accompanying disorder.</br>The diagnosis of RLS takes precedence over that of PLMD when potentially sleep- disrupting PLMS occur in the context of RLS.</br>In such cases, the diagnosis of RLS is made and the PLMS are noted. </br>5.</br>When it is reasonably certain that the PLMS have been induced by medication, and full criteria for PLMD are met, it is preferred that the more specific diagnosis of PLMD be used, rather than “Sleep related movement disorder due to a medication or substance.” </br>Essential Features PLMD is characterized by periodic episodes of repetitive, highly stereotyped limb movements that occur during sleep (PLMS), in conjunction with clinical sleep dis- turbance or fatigue that cannot be accounted for by another primary sleep disorder or other etiology. </br>PLMS occur most frequently in the lower extremities.</br>They typically involve exten- sion of the big toe, often in combination with partial flexion of the ankle, the knee, and sometimes, the hip.</br>Similar movements can occur in the upper limbs.</br>Individual movements may be associated with an autonomic arousal, a cortical arousal, or an awakening.</br>Typically, the patient is unaware of the limb movements or the frequent sleep disruption.</br>An arousal may precede, coincide with, or follow the limb movement, suggesting that a central generator may give rise to both the periodic movements and the related sleep disturbance. </br>A clinical history of sleep onset problems, sleep maintenance problems, or unrefresh- ing sleep attributable to the PLMS is needed for a diagnosis of PLMD.</br>These symp- toms have most consistently been associated with PLMS, and the presence of these clinical symptoms differentiates PLMD from asymptomatic PLMS.</br>Although exces- sive daytime sleepiness has been reported with PLMD in the past, newer data do not find significantly elevated Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) values in subjects with PLMS.</br>If the only complaint is sleep disruption for the bed partner, then PLMD should not be diagnosed but the sleep disturbance of the bed partner can be noted. </br>293 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders The PLMS index should exceed five per hour in children and 15 per hour in adult cases for a diagnosis of PLMD.</br>This is based on substantial normative data in children.</br>In adults, there is a significant increase in sleep disturbance symptoms with PLMS &gt;15/hour. </br>The PLMS and the symptoms of sleep disturbance or nonrestorative sleep should not be better explained by another etiology.</br>Most important in the differential diagnosis are RLS, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and narcolepsy.</br>Research studies indicate that five or more PLMS per hour occur in 80% to 90% of patients with RLS, in about 70% with RBD, and in 45% to 65% with narcolepsy.</br>In RBD, PLMS are often present without arousals during nonrapid eye movement sleep (NREM) sleep but can also con- tinue into REM sleep, which is unusual in all other settings.</br>If significant daytime sleep- iness and PLMS are present, a diagnosis of narcolepsy should be considered.</br>PLMD should not be diagnosed when criteria for one of these three disorders is met.</br>However, the primary disorder “with PLMS” can be specified (e.g., “RLS with PLMS”). </br>A sensitive technique, such as pressure transducer airflow monitoring or esophageal manometry, should be used to monitor breathing during polysomnography to rea- sonably exclude sleep related breathing disorders (SRBDs) as the direct cause of the PLMS.</br>When independent PLMS are present in patients with SRBDs, a separate diag- nosis of PLMD may be considered if the PLMS persist despite adequate treatment of the SRBD and otherwise unexplained sleep disturbance remains.</br>Ideally, polysom- nography for the diagnosis of PLMD should be performed after the biologic effect of a medication or substance, such as an antidepressant known to induce or aggravate PLMS, has ended. </br>Associated Features Higher rates of mood disorders, anxiety, attention deficits, oppositional behaviors, and parasomnias have been reported in some studies of patients with PLMD.</br>In children with PLMD, a family history of RLS is common.</br>A sustained clinical response to dopa- minergic therapy is supportive of the diagnosis of PLMD.</br>Although PLMD symptoms may be responsive to

 function.</br>Less evidence is available for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), alcohol, pain, and sleep deprivation as factors that worsen PLMS. </br>Familial Patterns The familial pattern of PLMD has not been studied in detail.</br>Families with RLS have been found to include first-degree relatives without RLS but with increased rates of PLMS or PLMD, raising the possibility that PLMD is an attenuated manifestation or a precursor to RLS.</br>The gene variants BTBD9 and MEIS1, which were found in genome- wide studies of RLS, appear to influence the expression of PLMS. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Although the typical age of onset is not known, PLMD occurs in both children and adults, with onset as early as infancy.</br>The natural history has not been described in detail, but some pediatric cases of PLMD progress to RLS.</br>Incidence and remission rates are unknown.</br>Impaired performance in a simulated driving task has been found in patients with PLMD.</br>Increased PLMS have been associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality in some studies.</br>PLMS-related overac- tivity of the sympathetic nervous system is postulated to be a potential mechanism for these associations. </br>295 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders Developmental Issues Given the low background rates of PLMS in children, PLMD has emerged as a useful diagnostic category in pediatric sleep medicine.</br>Pediatric PLMD has important</br>clini-</br>cal</br>and polysomnographic correlates that are comparable in severity to pediatric OSA.</br>However, PLMS and PLMD normative data remain sparse for children younger than two years. </br>In the elderly, frequent occurrence of other conditions that can account for sleep dis- turbance and fatigue makes application of PLMD criteria difficult, even though PLMS are common. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Dopaminergic impairment has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PLMS and PLMD.</br>The study of PLMS in RLS and in children also suggests genetic diathesis and iron status as factors.</br>Cyclic alternating pattern, a marker of nonrestorative sleep, is increased in individuals with PLMS and may influence the periodicity of PLMS.</br>Cortical arousals can precede, coincide with, or follow PLMS, indicating that PLMS do not cause the arousals.</br>In addition, PLMS can be dissociated from arousals pharma- cologically, suggesting an indirect relation, possibly mediated by a central generator.</br>The autonomic arousals associated with PLMS are characterized by significant heart rate and blood pressure surges, a mechanism for possible increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk. </br>Objective Findings PLMS can appear immediately with the onset of stage N1 sleep, are frequent during stage N2 sleep, decrease in frequency in stage N3, and are usually absent during stage R sleep.</br>PLMS typically occur in discrete episodes that last from a few minutes to an hour.</br>Both lower limbs should be monitored for the presence of limb movements.</br>Movements of the upper limbs may be sampled if clinically indicated.</br>The anterior tibialis electro- myogram (EMG) shows repetitive contractions, each lasting 0.5 to 10 seconds.</br>The movements may affect one or, more typically, both of the lower limbs, but not neces- sarily in a symmetric or simultaneous pattern.</br>Specific scoring criteria for PLMS are described in the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. </br>Self-reports, bed partner observations, or parental reports for children have not been found to have sufficient specificity or sensitivity to replace objective testing for PLMS. </br>Care must be taken to discriminate PLMS from other movements such as a simple change in body position, stretching of a limb, or a muscle cramp.</br>PLMS are longer in duration than myoclonic jerks, which, by definition, are typically 50 to 150 millisec- onds long.</br>Movements associated with respiratory events, hypnagogic foot tremor, or alternating leg muscle activation during sleep (ALMA) should not be included in the PLMS index. </br>PLMS may be associated with electroencephalographic (cortical) arousals or with awakenings.</br>Autonomic arousals—measured by a change in heart rate, blood pressure, or pulse transit time—have been shown to be more frequent than cortical arousals.</br>In some cases, periodic arousals may persist even though the PLMS have subsided.</br>The arousals are typically more difficult to measure than are the PLMS, and their clinical significance is a topic of ongoing debate.</br>As with obstructive sleep apnea, the associated cortical arousal index has not proven more useful than the PLMS index in making clini- cal decisions.</br>Although a subjective report of excessive daytime sleepiness is present in some patients with PLMD, mean sleep latency measured by MSLT has not been found to be consistently abnormal or to correlate with the PLMS cortical arousal index. </br>The movements should be reported as an index of total sleep time, called the PLMS index.</br>The PLMS index is the number of periodic limb movements per hour of total sleep time, as determined by polysomnography.</br>The PLMS arousal index is the number of PLMS associated with a cortical arousal, expressed per hour of total sleep time.</br>Other parameters for the description of PLMS include periodicity index, intermove- ment interval distribution, and time of night distribution.</br>These features have been shown to help differentiate PLMS patterns in different conditions (e.g., a finding of the highest periodicity indices in adult RLS and PLMD). </br>Leg actigraphy has been validated against PSG for the measurement of PLMS and provides a methodology to assess PLMS in large populations, as well as night-to-night variability. </br>Differential Diagnosis As described in the essential features section, PLMD is a diagnosis of exclusion and it is important to differentiate it from other conditions in which PLMS occur, particularly RLS, RBD, narcolepsy, and SRBDs.</br>Increased rates of PLMS have also been reported in multiple system atrophy,

-responsive dystonia, sleep related eating disorder, spinal cord injury, end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, Parkinson disease, sickle cell disease, posttraumatic stress disorder, Asperger syndrome, Williams syn- drome, and multiple sclerosis.</br>Dopaminergic impairment and/or diminished inhibition of the central pattern generator for PLMS have been proposed as common factors linking various disorders and PLMS. </br>297 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep starts (hypnic jerks) need to be differentiated from PLMS.</br>Sleep starts typically are limited to the transition from wakefulness to sleep, are not periodic, and are briefer (20 to 100 milliseconds) than PLMS.</br>Normal phasic REM activity is limited to REM sleep, typically occurs in 5- to 15-second clusters, and is usually associated with bursts of REMs.</br>Phasic REM EMG twitches are more variable in duration and do not have the periodicity of PLMS.</br>Fragmentary myoclonus is characterized by EMG activity that is briefer (75 to 150 milliseconds), more variable in duration, less periodic than PLMS, and has little or no associated visible movement.</br>Also, PLMS must be differentiated from movements associated with nocturnal epileptic seizures and myoclonic epilepsy and from a number of forms of myoclonus seen while awake, such as in Alzheimer disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and other neuropathologic conditions.</br>However, in these disorders, the involuntary movements are prominent during the daytime, often do not disappear with activity, are prominent in the arms and other body parts in addition to the legs, and do not display the periodicity seen with PLMS. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions </br>There has been controversy over the clinical significance of PLMS.</br>To date, the inter- pretation of most studies has been confounded by multiple factors that include: impre- cise diagnostic criteria; confusion between PLMS and PLMD; inadequate monitoring for subtle SRBDs; a lack of consideration of medications known to induce, worsen, or suppress PLMS; and inadequate measurement of the known night-to-night vari- ability of PLMS.</br>Newer respiratory monitoring techniques for polysomnography and the use of actigraphy monitors over several nights should help address a number of these issues.</br>The role of associated arousals in relation to clinical symptoms is yet to be determined, but the appreciation of autonomic arousals as well as cortical arousals might be critical.</br>It is possible that PLMS are a measurable marker of unstable sleep, related to genetic diathesis and dopaminergic impairment. </br>Bibliography Ferri R.

A painful sensation in the leg or foot associated with sudden, involuntary muscle hardness or tightness, indicating a strong muscle contraction. </br>B. The painful muscle contractions occur during the time in bed, although they may arise from either wakefulness or sleep. </br>C. The pain is relieved by forceful stretching of the affected muscles, thus releasing the contraction. </br>Essential Features Sleep related leg cramps are painful sensations caused by sudden and intense involun- tary contractions of muscles or muscle groups during which there is muscle spasm and hardness for several seconds.</br>These painful sensations are usually in the calf or small muscle of the foot.</br>Occurring during the time in bed, sleep related leg cramps may arise from either wakefulness or sleep. </br>Sleep related leg cramps usually start abruptly but may in some cases be preceded by a less painful warning sensation.</br>The muscle contractions last for a few seconds up to several minutes and then remit spontaneously.</br>The frequency of sleep related leg cramps varies considerably from less than yearly to multiple episodes every night. </br>299 Sleep Related Movement Disorders The cramps can be relieved by strongly stretching the affected muscle and sometimes also by local massage, application of heat, or movement of the affected limb.</br>Leg cramps can be present primarily during the daytime. </br>Associated Features The muscle cramp affects sleep.</br>The pain from the cramp itself and from the activities used to relieve it commonly disturb sleep onset or cause an awakening from sleep.</br>Often the presenting complaint is insomnia, at times severe. </br>Tenderness and discomfort in the muscle may persist for several hours after the cramp- ing.</br>Persisting discomfort after the cramping episode often delays subsequent return to sleep. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Sleep related leg cramps are known to be either idiopathic or secondary to other medical conditions, but there have been no indications of significant differences in the clinical features of the disorder related to the cause. </br>Demographics Sleep related leg cramps are common.</br>It has been suggested that nearly every adult older than 50 years has experienced sleep related leg cramps at least once.</br>Both the prevalence and the frequency of the events increase with age.</br>Sleep related leg cramps have been reported to occur at least occasionally in about 7% of children and adoles- cents, 33% in adults older than 60 years, and 50% in adults older than 80 years, with both older groups reporting a symptom frequency of at least once every two months.</br>Nightly leg cramps have been reported in 6% of adults older than 60 years.</br>No defin- itive sex information has been reported, though a single study reported a higher prev- alence in women. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors </br>Predisposing factors include diabetes mellitus, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cramp fasciculation syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic disorders.</br>The disorder can be associated with prior vigorous exercise, prolonged standing at work, dehydration, fluid and electrolyte distur- bances, endocrine disorders, neuromuscular disorders, disorders of reduced mobility, vascular disease, cirrhosis, and hemodialysis.</br>Medications that have been associated with sleep related leg cramps include oral

 co-contractions and, thus, are not classified as dystonias.</br>Some nocturnal leg cramps, particularly those in the feet, may resemble dystonias but, unlike classic dystonias, sleep related leg and foot cramps are relieved by stretching the affected muscle or muscles. </br>Electrophysiologic recordings show that the cramps typically start with spontaneous firing of anterior horn cells followed by motor unit discharges for contractions at rates up to 300 Hz (considerably more than with voluntary muscle contractions).</br>The pain may result from local metabolite accumulations or from local ischemia. </br>Muscle and tendon shortening due to age or lack of stretching exercise is thought to contribute to the development of sleep related leg cramps.</br>Exercise involving stretch- ing the affected muscles is thought to help prevent or reduce the occurrence of sleep related leg cramps. </br>Objective Findings Polysomnographic studies of patients with chronic sleep related leg cramps reveal non- periodic bursts of gastrocnemius EMG activity.</br>Episodes arise from sleep without any specific preceding physiologic changes during sleep. </br>Differential Diagnosis Sleep related leg cramps are common in chronic myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, muscular pain fasciculation syndrome, and disorders of calcium metabolism.</br>These causes should be differentiated by clinical history and physical examination.</br>RLS is Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders sometimes confused with sleep related leg cramps because both can present with leg discomfort during the sleep period and RLS patients sometimes complain of a cramping sensation.</br>However, if patients meet the diagnostic criteria for RLS and do not describe an actual cramp or hardening of the muscle, the diagnosis should be RLS.</br>Because leg cramps can mimic RLS and meet all the criteria for RLS, the description of an actual spasm or hardening of the muscle is a critical differentiating factor.</br>A leg cramp is also a much briefer event than the typical symptoms of RLS, which can persist for hours.</br>However, RLS and leg cramps may sometimes be seen in the same individual. </br>Dystonia is ongoing daily spasm of muscles and is distinguished electrophysiologi- cally from leg cramps by ongoing co-contraction of

Transient morning jaw muscle pain or fatigue; and/or temporal headache; and/or jaw locking upon awakening consistent with above reports of tooth grinding during sleep. Notes .</br>Although polysomnography is not required for the diagnosis, sleep bruxism, as described in the most recent version of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events, is ideally recorded with masseter muscle activity with audio-video signal to increase diagnostic reliability. </br>Essential Features Bruxism is defined as a repetitive jaw-muscle activity characterized by clenching or grinding of the teeth and/or by bracing or thrusting of the mandible.</br>Bruxism Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders has been divided into its two distinct circadian manifestations: sleep bruxism and awake bruxism. </br>In sleep, jaw muscle contractions are frequently repeated over time and are termed rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA).</br>These contractions can take two forms on electromyographic traces: a series of repetitive activity (phasic muscle contractions) or isolated sustained jaw clenching (tonic contractions).</br>These contractions during sleep produce tooth-grinding sounds and are referred to as sleep related bruxism. </br>Sleep related bruxism can lead to abnormal tooth wear, tooth pain, jaw muscle pain, and temporal headache.</br>Severe sleep related bruxism may also result in sleep dis- ruption.</br>This may involve not only the individual affected, but also the bed partner, because the sounds made by the friction of the teeth are usually perceived as being unpleasant and can be quite loud and disturbing to those nearby. </br>The disorder is typically brought to dental or medical attention because of the tooth damage, pain, or disturbing sounds.</br>Less commonly, it may present as a cause of dis- turbed sleep.</br>Young and otherwise healthy individuals with sleep related bruxism appear to have normal sleep structure and homeostasis.</br>The majority of RMMA epi- sodes during sleep occur in association with sleep arousal. </br>Jaw muscle pain, tenderness in the masseter and temporalis muscle regions, morning headache, or fatigue can arise due to sleep related bruxism. </br>Associated Features Additional symptoms include a variety of unpleasant muscle and tooth sensations, lim- itation of jaw movements, orofacial pain, and temporal/tension headaches.</br>Tooth wear, fractured teeth, and buccal lacerations also can occur.</br>These symptoms may be induced by sleep related bruxism, but the connection may not be apparent to the affected indi- vidual and diagnostic discrimination is weak. </br>Headaches are frequently reported by both adults and children with sleep related bruxism.</br>The headache usually involves the temporal regions and it has the charac- teristics of a tension headache.</br>It is reported either in the morning (more frequently) or during the day (with wake bruxism).</br>The estimated OR for headache in individuals with sleep related bruxism is &gt; 4 compared to controls. </br>There is high individual variability in the intensity and duration of sleep related bruxism, but in the most severe cases, hundreds of events can occur during a night of sleep.</br>However, no direct relationship has been observed between the severity of sleep related bruxism and the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms.</br>Indeed, indi- viduals with a mild to moderate index of sleep bruxism (2 to 4 RMMA episodes/hour of sleep) have a higher risk of reporting painful jaw upon awakening (OR 3.9), and masticatory muscle fatigue (OR 5.1) compared to individuals with severe sleep related bruxism (&gt; 4 RMMA episodes/hour of sleep). </br>Psychosocial components may also be linked to sleep related bruxism.</br>The psycholog- ical assessment of otherwise healthy adults with sleep related bruxism suggests a cor- relation (not yet proven as a causality) between bruxism and stress/anxiety.</br>Moreover, both children and adults with sleep related bruxism seem to have higher scores in stress, anxiety, and psychiatric scales compared to control individuals. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Sleep related bruxism without clear cause is termed primary or idiopathic. </br>Forms of sleep related bruxism associated with the use of

, or a variety of medical disorders (e.g., Parkinson disease, RBD, Down syndrome) are defined as secondary sleep related bruxism.</br>Treatment-induced sleep related bruxism is also termed iatrogenic. </br>Although the primary form of sleep related bruxism is most often reported in healthy children and adults, secondary sleep related bruxism is observed in children with cere- bral palsy and mental retardation and in adult patients with abnormal movements such as in oromandibular myoclonus/facio-mandibular myoclonus or with sleep related breathing disorders.</br>OSA and sleep related bruxism commonly co-occur. </br>Tooth grinding and clenching also can occur during wakefulness, as an oral parafunc- tional activity known as awake bruxism.</br>Awake bruxism is considered a different dis- order, probably with different diagnostic criteria and pathophysiology; its association with sleep bruxism is still under debate.</br>However, the two oral activities may coexist in the same individual. </br>Demographics The prevalence of sleep related bruxism, based on reports from parents or sleep partner, is highest in childhood (approximately 14% to 17%) and then decreases over the life span.</br>In teenagers to young adults, prevalence is in the 12% range.</br>In young to middle-aged adults, it is approximately 8% but as little as 3% in older persons.</br>The reported reduction in tooth grinding in the elderly probably overestimates the actual Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders reduction, because edentulism, use of dentures, and changes in sleeping behaviors (i.e., in isolation) may influence reporting.</br>There is no reported sex difference for the prev- alence of sleep related bruxism. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors </br>Predisposing factors include personality types; for example, individuals who are highly motivated or characteristically maintain high vigilance may have an increased preva- lence of sleep related bruxism. </br>Genetic predisposition is plausible but still under investigation.</br>As described below, there is some familial predisposition due to environmental or shared genetic factors.</br>Recently, a serotonin gene was described in bruxism patients but the absence of distinction between the wake and sleep forms in this report preclude firm conclusions. </br>Precipitating factors can include anxiety related to current life events, tasks requir- ing high levels of performance, and repetitive tasks with short deadlines.</br>The use of cigarettes or caffeine in the hours before sleep also can contribute to the occur- rence of sleep related bruxism (probably due to the increased arousals and sleep instability). </br>The role of dental morphologic “defects” (occlusal interferences) remains controver- sial in the etiology of sleep related bruxism.</br>Tooth contacts do not usually set in motion a bruxism episode; they are usually late in the series of events occurring during sleep related bruxism/</br>tooth grinding.</br>Hence, the causality link between tooth contact and sleep related bruxism is not supported by the temporal sequence. </br>Familial Patterns Sleep related bruxism tends to occur in families; approximately 20% to 50% of affected individuals have at least one direct family member with a history of tooth grinding, and childhood sleep related bruxism appears to persist into adulthood in two thirds of reported cases.</br>However, no genetic variants or genetic inheritance patterns so far have been associated with sleep related bruxism. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications The onset of sleep related bruxism may occur during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood.</br>It is difficult to establish the time of onset with precision because it is mainly based on the awareness of the individual or</br>his/her family members who report the disorder. </br>306 Sleep related bruxism in childhood has been reported by parents to begin as soon as both upper and lower teeth have erupted.</br>Secondary sleep related bruxism may occur at any age, but is more common in younger and middle-aged adults. </br>Even without a tooth grinding history or complaints, RMMA may be observed in most normal sleepers (on average, one episode per hour of sleep) across the life span.</br>However, in individuals with sleep related bruxism, jaw-muscle contractions are more frequent and more intense.</br>This may explain the secondary tooth damage and the occurrence of pain and other symptoms. </br>The night-to-night variability in episodes of audible tooth grinding sounds is large (greater than 50% coefficient of variation).</br>In-laboratory polysomnographic record- ings indicate that the corresponding variability in frequency of RMMA is smaller (approximately 25%), although ambulatory recording has suggested somewhat higher RMMA variability.</br>First-night effect on RMMA index is minimal. </br>Dental damage and abnormal tooth wear are the most frequent signs of the disorder.</br>However, they are not a direct proof of current sleep related bruxism and many contrib- uting factors have to be ruled out (e.g., type of diet in the occurrence of abnormal tooth wear).</br>Diagnostic discriminative strength of these dental findings is weak; severity of wear cannot account for the index (i.e., frequency of RMMA).</br>Sleep related bruxism could lead to temporomandibular joint disorders (e.g., pain, joint sound [click], or jaw movement limitations), although recent evidence does not support this association.</br>Transient morning orofacial pain, including temporal headaches, is not uncommon, as described above.</br>Hypertrophy of the masseter and temporalis muscles can occur, but the diagnostic specificity of this finding for sleep related bruxism is also weak. </br>The natural course of this sleep disorder is usually benign.</br>Many individuals with sleep related bruxism remain asymptomatic for most of their lives.</br>Others can experi- ence associated symptoms (i.e., pain) that may interfere with their quality of life and/ or sleep and may require treatments.</br>Further diagnostic investigations and assessment are recommended if sleep related bruxism is associated with other more severe sleep or medical disorders (e.g., SRBD,

, epilepsy). </br>Developmental Issues Sleep related bruxism is frequently reported in childhood but decreases with age.</br>However, some individuals may experience it every night for most of their lives. </br>307 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders Conceptualizations of sleep related bruxism in children vary.</br>Some consider this a physiological oral parafunction while teeth are erupting or exfoliating, whereas others view this as a sleep disorder with many associated signs and symptoms.</br>Sleep related bruxism, especially in children, has been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, parasomnias, SRBD, snoring, and many psychological and medical conditions. </br>In the elderly, sleep related bruxism has been observed in association with movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson disease or oral tardive dyskinesia persisting during sleep), RBD, and dementia. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The majority of RMMA episodes during sleep (up to 80%) occur in association with sleep arousals.</br>Sleep related bruxism episodes typically follow a clear arousal sequence, starting with increased sympathetic-cardiac activity and fast electroenceph- alographic (EEG) waves in the minutes to seconds preceding the onset of an RMMA episode.</br>The jaw muscle contractions are then followed by, or are concomitant with, an increase in blood pressure and ventilation.</br>RMMA episodes sometimes conclude with swallowing.</br>Other causes of sleep bruxism onset are unknown, although potential candidates include airway resistance and oropharyngeal dryness. </br>In the majority of individuals with sleep related bruxism, the frequency of sleep arous- als is within the normal range.</br>However, they may have an exaggerated responsiveness to ongoing sleep arousals or an increased magnitude of arousal.</br>Individuals with sleep related bruxism show more CAP phase A3 (as described by the scoring and analysis of cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) during sleep) than controls, an expression of increased arousal pressure and increased sleep instability.</br>This increased sleep instability seems to be the “permissive window” for occurrence of RMMA during sleep. </br>Objective Findings Polysomnographic (PSG) monitoring of individuals with sleep related bruxism demonstrates increased masseter and temporalis muscle activity during sleep, along with grinding sounds.</br>RMMA episodes can occur during all sleep stages, but are most common in sleep stages N1 and N2 (more than 80% of episodes), whereas fewer than 10% of RMMA episodes occur during REM sleep.</br>However, in some individuals, sleep related bruxism occurs predominantly in REM sleep. </br>As described above, the majority of sleep related bruxism episodes are temporally associated with sleep arousal and are preceded by signs of autonomic/cardiac activa- tion (e.g., increased heart rate and blood pressure). </br>308 Three subtypes of the EMG pattern of sleep related bruxism have been described: phasic activity at 1 Hz frequency with EMG bursts lasting 0.25 to 2 seconds; sustained tonic activity lasting longer than 2 seconds; or a mixed pattern.</br>An episode begins after at least a three-second interval with no muscle activity. </br>Polysomnography is not usually performed in otherwise healthy individuals with sleep related bruxism in routine clinical settings.</br>However, PSG may be indicated to demon- strate the disorder and to rule out associated respiratory disturbances, gastroesophageal reflux, RBD, night terrors, faciomandibular myoclonus, or epilepsy.</br>The sensitivity of polysomnographic study in detecting sleep related bruxism in severe cases is moderate to high; in milder cases, however, it may be low due to the night-to-night variability in RMMA and tooth grinding. </br>Ambulatory home monitoring may be used for screening, diagnosis, and treatment outcome assessment by studying the individual in his/her usual environment, but it is characterized by lower diagnostic specificity due to the absence of audiovisual record- ings (i.e., 20% overestimation in RMMA frequency is expected due to poor capacity to exclude concomitant nonspecific activities). </br>To record and score sleep related bruxism activity (i.e., RMMA)</br>, there must be a minimum of one masseter muscle monitor, ideally with audiovisual recording, to associate muscular activity with grinding sound production.</br>Video monitoring helps distinguish bruxism from other orofacial and masticatory movements that normally occur during sleep (e.g., swallowing, coughing) and from specific movement disorders (RBD, epilepsy and tooth tapping, oromandibular myoclonus). </br>For the best level of diagnostic specificity and sensitivity, bilateral masseter and tem- poralis muscle EMG recordings, referenced to ear, mastoid, or zygomatic bone, are advisable. </br>Differential Diagnosis The disorder seldom poses diagnostic problems.</br>Evaluation for temporomandibular disorders and damage to dentition is indicated. </br>Sleep related bruxism needs to be differentiated from other faciomandibular activities occurring during sleep, such as faciomandibular myoclonus, SRBD,

, abnormal swallowing, gastro-esophageal reflux, night terrors, confusional arousals, dyskinetic jaw movements persisting in sleep (dystonia, tremor, chorea, dyskinesia), and, rarely, sleep related epilepsy. </br>309 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders Oromandibular or faciomandibular myoclonus has been observed in approximately 10% of individuals with severe sleep related bruxism, but it can also occur in indi- viduals without abnormally increased RMMA events.</br>As opposed to sleep related bruxism, faciomandibular myoclonus consists of EMG bursts of brief duration (less than 250 milliseconds in length) in the facial muscles; these can occur either as isolated bursts or as a cluster of regularly or irregularly occurring brief bursts.</br>A high index of oromandibular myoclonus in sleep has been observed in idiopathic RBD patients. </br>Rhythmic jaw movements also have been observed in association with partial complex or generalized seizure disorders.</br>Epilepsy needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis, although the presentation of epilepsy as relatively isolated sleep related bruxism is very rare. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions An expert bruxism international group has proposed a diagnostic grading system of “possible,” “probable,” and “definite” for both sleep and awake bruxism.</br>Such a clinical tool will help to discriminate sleep bruxism from awake bruxism, although further validation is required for clinical and research purposes in all relevant dental and medical domains.</br>In summary, this group suggests that a rating of: (1) “possible” is given if based on self-report, by means of questionnaires, and/or the anamnestic part of a clinical examination; (2) “probable” sleep or awake bruxism is given if based on self-report and supportive physical findings; (3) “definite” sleep bruxism if based on self-report, physical findings, and a polysomnographic recording, preferably with audiovisual recordings. </br>The clinical relevance of sleep related bruxism in cases of comorbidity with other medical problems such as snoring, sleep related breathing disorder, RBD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, headache, and orofacial pain needs to be assessed in order to distinguish primary benign forms of sleep related bruxism from those that rep- resent an epiphenomenon of other more severe sleep and medical disorders. </br>Sleep related bruxism may be concomitant to breathing disorders, including any level of severity of OSA; further research is in progress to assess the specificity and validity of this association. </br>There is currently no evidence supporting the possibility that patients with sleep related bruxism, in its primary form, are at increased risk of neurological disorders; such a risk factor assessment needs long- term study before any conclusion can be drawn. </br>310 Investigation of genetic associations to sleep related bruxism require large sample sizes, using valid tools to assess the specificity of RMMA versus other oromandibular activities and to discriminate gene candidates specific for bruxism from those related to its comorbidities such as stress or other related triggers of RMMA. </br>Bibliography Abe S, Yamaguchi T,

, jac- tatio corporis nocturna, rhythmie du sommeil. </br>Diagnostic Criteria Criteria A-D must be met A.</br>The patient exhibits repetitive, stereotyped, and rhythmic motor behaviors involving large muscle groups. </br>B. The movements are predominantly sleep related, occurring near nap or bedtime, or when the individual appears drowsy or asleep. </br>C. The behaviors result in a significant complaint as manifest by at least one of the following:1 .</br>Interference with normal sleep. </br>2. Significant impairment in daytime function. </br>3. Self-inflicted bodily injury or likelihood of injury if preventive measures are not used. </br>D.</br>The rhythmic movements are not better explained by another movement disorder or epilepsy. </br>Notes .</br>When there are no clinical consequences of the rhythmic movements, the rhythmic movements are simply noted but the term rhythmic movement disorder is not employed. </br>Essential Features Sleep related rhythmic movement disorder (RMD) is characterized by repetitive, ste- reotyped, and rhythmic motor behaviors (not tremors) that occur predominantly during drowsiness or sleep and involve large muscle groups.</br>The occurrence of significant clinical consequences differentiates RMD from developmentally normal sleep related movements. </br>Typically seen in infants and children, but also in adults, RMD comprises several sub- types.</br>Body rocking may involve the entire body, with the individual on hands and knees, or it may be limited to the torso, with the individual sitting.</br>Head banging often occurs with the person prone, repeatedly lifting the head or entire upper torso, and forc- ibly banging the head back down into the pillow or mattress.</br>Alternately, the individual may sit with the back of the head against the headboard or wall, repeatedly banging the occiput.</br>Combining head banging and body rocking, they may rock on hands and knees, banging the vertex or frontal region of the head into the headboard or wall.</br>Head rolling consists of side-to-side head movements, usually with the child (or adult) in the supine position.</br>Less common rhythmic movement forms include body rolling, leg banging, or leg rolling.</br>Rhythmic humming or inarticulate sounds often accompany the body, head, or limb movements and may be quite loud. </br>Episodes often occur near sleep onset, although they also may occur at any time during the night and even during quiet wakeful activities, such as listening to music or trav- eling in vehicles.</br>The movement frequency can vary, but the rate is usually between 0.5 per second and two per second.</br>Duration of the individual movement clusters also varies but generally is less than 15 minutes.</br>Cessation of movements may occur fol- lowing environmental disturbance or being spoken to.</br>Children who have sufficient language development to be asked about event recall in the morning are typically amnestic for the episodes.</br>Rarely, adults will report a volitional component. </br>Sleep related rhythmic movements are common in normal infants and children.</br>Without evidence for significant consequences, the movements alone should not be considered a disorder.</br>Sleep related rhythmic movements should be considered a disorder only if the behaviors significantly interfere with normal sleep, cause significant impairment in daytime function, or result in self-inflicted bodily injury (or would result in injury if preventive measures are not used). </br>Associated Features The vast majority of infants and children with sleep related rhythmic movements are otherwise developmentally and intellectually normal, as are most adolescents and adults. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Body Rocking: The whole body is rocked while on the hands and knees. </br>Head Banging: The head is forcibly moved, striking an object. </br>Head Rolling: The head is moved laterally, typically while in a supine position.</br>Other: Includes body rolling, leg rolling, and leg banging. </br>Combined: Involves two or more of the individual types. </br>313 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders Demographics At nine months of age, 59% of all infants have been reported to exhibit one or more of the following sleep related rhythmic movements: body rocking (43%), head banging (22%), or head rolling (24%).</br>At 18 months, the overall prevalence has been reported to decline to 33%, and by five years, to only 5%.</br>Most pediatric studies have found no sex difference. </br>Over 50 cases of RMD have been reported in adolescents and adults, with a male pre- ponderance found in adults. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors The soothing effect of vestibular stimulation has been proposed as the initiating factor in infants and toddlers.</br>Environmental stress and lack of environmental stimulation have also been proposed as factors.</br>One study found higher anxiety scores in children with body rocking than in controls.</br>Self-stimulation has been suggested as a factor, particularly in intellectually disabled, autistic, and emotionally disturbed children.</br>Rhythmic movements have been postulated to be a calming technique employed by children to combat insomnia. </br>Rhythmic movements have been reported in association with RLS, OSA, narcolepsy, RBD, and ADHD.</br>Rhythmic movements may be used as a conscious strategy to relieve the urge to move or the uncomfortable sensations associated with RLS. OSA-</br>associated RMD often improves with positive airway pressure.</br>Individuals with narco- lepsy may initiate rhythmic movements to terminate episodes of sleep paralysis. </br>In older children or adults, stereotypic movements may be associated with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder.</br>However, in most of these cases, the movements are not predominantly sleep related, and an additional diagnosis of RMD is not indicated. </br>Familial Patterns A familial pattern has been reported rarely, as has occurrence in identical twins. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications The onset of sleep related rhythmic movements is typically in early childhood.</br>Body rocking has a mean age of onset of six months, head banging of nine months, and head rolling of ten months.</br>The condition may rarely present at an older age following central nervous system trauma.</br>Sleep related rhythmic movements commonly resolve in the second or third year of life.</br>Persistence at five years of age occurs in about 5% of children.</br>Sleep related movements rarely continue into adolescence and adulthood. </br>314 Worsening or spontaneous onset in adults is very rare.</br>In some adult cases the chief concern is disturbance of the bed partner’s sleep.</br>Most adolescents and adults have one form of RMD, although some have two or more. </br>Head banging is the most disturbing form of the problem.</br>Typical cases in infants and toddlers pose little risk of serious injury.</br>Vigorous rhythmic movements can produce loud noises when the patient hits the bed frame or when the bed bangs against the wall or floor.</br>The noises can be very disturbing to other family members.</br>Parental concern is common, and psychosocial consequences in the older individual can be distressing.</br>It is important to discuss appropriate safety precautions with the patient’s caretak- ers.</br>Under extraordinary circumstances, particularly in the developmentally disabled, injury to soft tissues or bone has been reported. </br>Developmental Issues Because age-related factors are a critical dimension for RMD, developmental issues are discussed under Essential Features and other sections. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology In infants and young children, rhythmic movements have been hypothesized to promote motor development by stimulation of the vestibular system.</br>More recently, the role of inhibitory control on the central motor pattern generator has been sug- gested as a physiologic mechanism to explain both pediatric and adult forms of sleep related rhythmic movements. </br>Objective Findings Polysomnographic scoring rules for RMD are defined in the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events.</br>Video-polysomnographic studies have shown rhythmic movements to occur most often in association with stages N1 and N2 sleep; 46% occur while falling asleep or during NREM sleep; 30% during both NREM and REM sleep; and 24% only during REM sleep.</br>The exclusively REM-related rhythmic movements occur more frequently in adults.</br>Although an epileptic etiology has been reported in one individual, most EEG studies have shown normal activity between epi- sodes of rhythmic behavior. </br>Differential Diagnosis RMD must be distinguished from other repetitive movements involving restricted small muscle groups, such as sleep related bruxism, thumb sucking, and rhythmic sucking of a pacifier or the lips, as well as other specifically defined rhythmic movements of sleep, such as hypnagogic foot tremor. </br>315 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders In adults, RMD can be misdiagnosed as RBD or be comorbid with RBD.</br>Video poly- somnography is particularly helpful in these cases.</br>Rhythmic movements may occur as a conscious or unconscious strategy to relieve RLS symptoms.</br>If the rhythmic move- ments are clearly in response to RLS sensations, then a separate diagnosis of RMD is not needed.</br>However, RMD may be diagnosed if RMD criteria are met and RLS does not adequately explain the presence or extent of rhythmic movements. </br>Children with autism spectrum disorder often exhibit repetitive behaviors, but these movements typically occur during wakefulness and are not predominantly sleep related.</br>Stereotypic movement disorder is a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnosis that is typically seen with intellectual disability and is not predominantly sleep related.</br>In children with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability, an additional diagnosis of RMD should be made only if the movements are predominantly sleep related.</br>Akathisia is seen as a complication of neuroleptic medi- cation and is not predominantly sleep related. </br>Autoerotic or masturbatory behaviors may involve body rocking or other repetitive body movements, but the primary focus is genital stimulation as is evident by direct genital contact.</br>Rarely, RMD needs to be differentiated from epilepsy, tic disorders, or involuntary movements associated with other neurological conditions. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions </br>There is controversy about the classification of hypnagogic foot tremor as a separate entity or as a subtype of sleep related rhythmic movements.</br>Many aspects of sleep related rhythmic movements deserve further study, including the relationship of the typical form seen in otherwise normal infants and young children to the rhythmic movements seen in children with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder.</br>The pathophysiology of persistent RMD is poorly understood, as is the association with other sleep disorders in adults. </br>Bibliography Dyken M, Lin-Dyken D, Yamada T.

 withdrawal syndrome, suggesting a subtype with this specific etiology.</br>It must be stressed, however, that some cases of neonatal abstinence syndrome do not follow a benign clinical course.</br>Whether such cases should be included with those of BSMI is an unresolved matter. </br>317 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Demographics The prevalence is unknown.</br>The incidence has been estimated at 3.7 per 10,000 live births.</br>More than 200 cases have been described in the literature.</br>Males are affected more than females by a ratio of about 2:1.</br>The typical age range is birth to six months of age. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors </br>Predisposing factors have not been delineated.</br>Rocking or repetitive noises may pre- cipitate individual episodes of BSMI. </br>Familial Patterns Familial occurrence has been described. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Onset is usually noted between birth and one month of age in a neurologically normal infant.</br>The course is self-limited and benign.</br>The disorder may be present for only a few days or may last for several months.</br>Maximum expression is typically between 15 and 35 days of age.</br>BSMI resolves by three months of age in 64% of affected infants, by six months in 95%, and by 12 months in 97% with persistence rarely into the second year of life or later.</br>There are no known complications.</br>Long-term follow-up in a limited number of children has shown normal psychomotor development and normal cognitive function at five to 10 years of age.</br>There is no evidence for an increased risk of seizures. </br>Developmental Issues Because age-related factors are a critical dimension for BSMI, developmental issues are discussed throughout this section. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The presence of a generator in the cervical spinal cord that is not adequately inhibited due to immature myelination of descending pathways has been hypothesized. </br>Objective Findings Video-polysomnographic EEG and EMG monitoring has demonstrated paroxysmal muscle activity, without ictal or interictal EEG abnormalities.</br>BSMI occurs predom- inantly during quiet sleep but also may be present during active sleep.</br>The muscle jerks are usually seen in clusters of four or five jerks per second, each jerk lasting 40 to 300 milliseconds.</br>BSMI clusters typically repeat in irregular series for one to 15 minutes, but, in some cases, the clusters may recur for up to 60 minutes or longer and be mistaken for status epilepticus.</br>One study showed 30% of the jerks to involve the whole body, 20% to involve the abdominal or proximal muscles, and 50% to involve only the arms or the legs.</br>The arms are usually more involved than the legs.</br>Activity is symmetrical in over 90% of cases but can be lateralized.</br>The myoclonus is not associ- ated with arousals, awakenings, or sleep stage transitions. </br>Spontaneous or provoked awakening of the infant leads to prompt, abrupt, and consis- tent cessation of the movements.</br>Gentle rocking of the infant or the infant’s crib has been shown to provoke the myoclonus.</br>This may be a useful maneuver during EEG monitoring when differentiation from seizures is of concern.</br>In contrast to jitteriness and other nonepileptic etiologies, BSMI will often increase rather than be suppressed by gentle restraint.</br>Neuroimaging studies are normal. </br>Differential Diagnosis BSMI should be distinguished from myoclonic seizures; misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary diagnostic testing or medication use.</br>The absence of episodes while awake in infants with BSMI is the single most helpful clinical feature.</br>In addition, BSMI will stop abruptly and consistently when the infant is aroused.</br>Neonatal sei- zures are often seen in the context of perinatal disorders such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, infection, or metabolic abnormalities, whereas BSMI is typically present in neurologically normal infants.</br>Infantile spasms (West syndrome) are most often seen after the first month of life but sometimes occur earlier.</br>Infantile spasms are usually manifest by sudden head flexion with arm extension and lower extremity flexion.</br>They are usually associated with a hypsarrhythmic EEG pattern.</br>Pyridoxine- dependency seizures are responsive to treatment with

Propriospinal Myoclonus at Sleep Onset ICD-9-CM code: 327.59 ICD-10-CM code: G47.69 Alternate Names Spinal myoclonus, plurisegmental myoclonus, intersegmental myoclonus, axial myoclonus. </br>Diagnostic Criteria Criteria A-E must be met A.</br>The patient complains of sudden jerks, mainly of the abdomen, trunk, and neck. </br>B. The jerks appear during relaxed wakefulness and drowsiness, as the patient attempts to fall asleep. </br>C. The jerks disappear upon mental activation and with onset of a stable sleep stage. </br>D. The jerks result in difficulty initiating sleep. </br>E.</br>The disorder is not better explained by another sleep disorder, medical or neurological disorder, mental disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder. </br>Notes .</br>Although there is no current definitive evidence that propriospinal myoclonus confined to sleep onset is associated with significant structural lesions of the spinal cord, propriospinal myoclonus that is persistent during the day has been linked to structural spinal cord pathology in 16% to 20% of cases. </br>Essential Features Propriospinal myoclonus at sleep onset (PSM) consists of sudden myoclonic jerks occurring in the transition from wakefulness to sleep and, rarely, during intrasleep wakefulness and upon awakening in the morning.</br>The jerks arise mainly in the axial muscles and spread rostrally and caudally according to propriospinal propagation.</br>The jerks may be of variable intensity; they are isolated, recurring in quasi-periodic fashion for variable durations, or may be repeated in brief clusters of a few movements, sepa- rated by longer intervals.</br>Jerks involve the abdominal and truncal muscles first and are then propagated to proximal muscles of the limbs and the neck.</br>The pattern of move- ment is usually flexor but may be an extension of the trunk.</br>Vocalization rarely occurs.</br>The jerks are most often spontaneous but, in some cases, can be evoked by external stimulations.</br>The jerks appear to be related to the recumbent position and a state of Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders relaxed wakefulness, particularly when the patient tries to fall asleep.</br>Any mental acti- vation makes the jerks disappear.</br>The jerks eventually disappear at sleep onset and remain absent throughout all stages of sleep, even though they sometimes reappear during intrasleep wakefulness. </br>Associated Features PSM often is associated with severe sleep-onset insomnia due to the inability of the patient to fall asleep because of the recurrent disturbing muscular activity. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes PSM may be considered a variant of the more generally described propriospinal myoc- lonus seen during the daytime.</br>In daytime PSM, myoclonic jerks involve the thoracoab- dominal/paraspinal or cervical muscles and spread caudally or rostrally to the other myotomes.</br>The jerks are provoked or worsened by the recumbent position and cannot be voluntarily suppressed.</br>They are often preceded by premonitory sensations, are stable over time, and respond unpredictably to drug treatment.</br>The frequent presleep worsening of daytime PSM (around 50% of the cases) suggests that patients with PSM may have a milder or variant form of a single clinical and neurophysiologic entity. </br>Demographics Epidemiologic data are lacking.</br>PSM is probably a rare condition.</br>A higher prevalence in men is reported.</br>The disorder affects adults and has not been reported in children. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Not applicable or known. </br>Familial Patterns Not applicable or known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications PSM arises in adulthood and is usually a chronic, unremitting condition.</br>Patients may develop a fear of falling asleep, anxiety, and depression.</br>Intense myoclonic jerks may cause injury to the patient or the bed partner. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of PSM is unknown.</br>PSM is thought to originate from a focal spinal pattern generator, set into motion by supraspinal dysfacilitatory influences typical of the state of relaxed wakefulness and drowsiness.</br>PSM is presumed to propagate up and down the spinal cord via slowly conducting, long propriospinal (intersegmental) pathways.</br>A focal spinal generator thus is able to recruit muscles from multiple segments. </br>Objective Findings Polysomnography demonstrates brief myoclonic EMG bursts recurring nonperiodi- cally with alpha activity present on the EEG and, in particular, when alpha activity spreads from the posterior to the anterior brain regions.</br>Epileptic EEG discharges are not observed in PSM.</br>Jerks disappear either with EEG desynchronization, due to mental activation, or with appearance of sleep spindles and K-complexes.</br>Jerks remain absent throughout sleep but may occasionally reappear upon awakening and during intrasleep wakefulness.</br>Polysomnography with extended EMG recording demonstrates that the jerks arise first in spinal innervated muscles and then propagate to more caudal and rostral muscles according to a propriospinal pattern of propagation.</br>Detailed analysis of the jerks shows that the EMG activity originates in muscles innervated by thoracic or cervical spinal segments (sternocleidomastoid, paraspinalis, rectus abdominis) and then spreads to more rostrally and caudally innervated muscles at a slow velocity (2 to 16 milliseconds; around 5 milliseconds on average).</br>Back-averaging of the EEG does not show any jerk-locked cortical activity.</br>MRI of the brain is normal.</br>In a recent review of PSM, only one patient with exacerbation at sleep onset had a hypersignal at T10-T11 and a nonspecific medullary cone lesion.</br>The remaining patients had no signs on spinal cord MRI at sleep onset. </br>MRI of the spine is usually normal but demonstrates a focal lesion in around 20% of the cases.</br>The causal relationship of PSM with these spinal lesions is unclear, although magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging with fiber tracking may demonstrate spinal tract disorganization. </br>Differential Diagnosis PSM shows features similar to those of the syndrome of intensified sleep starts.</br>However, sleep starts (hypnic jerks) usually appear during the transition between wakefulness and sleep and during light NREM sleep, whereas PSM may sometimes be present during relaxed wakefulness.</br>Unlike PSM, sleep starts (hypnic jerks) some- times affect only one or a few body segments; propriospinal propagation is not present in neurophysiological studies of sleep starts.</br>Phasic REM twitches, which are a normal phenomenon during REM sleep, involve the distal muscles of the hands and face, often without displacement of the body segment.</br>Fragmentary myoclonus resembles physiological hypnic myoclonus, but in an enhanced form, and persists throughout all stages of NREM and REM sleep.</br>Both physiological hypnic myoclonus and frag- mentary myoclonus are EMG findings not associated with overt muscular activity and Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders do not involve muscles acting across large joints.</br>Epileptic myoclonus is not confined to relaxed wakefulness and may be associated with epileptic discharges on the EEG.</br>PLMS are longer in duration, involve mainly the lower limbs, and usually spare truncal and abdominal muscles.</br>PLMs may begin during presleep wakefulness but generally occur during NREM sleep.</br>Some patients with RLS may have prominent PLMs in wakefulness while sitting or lying down.</br>However, prominent leg discomfort is usually present in these patients.</br>Occasionally PSM may be present in RLS/PLMS patients in wake before sleep, but the EMG morphology is different.</br>In addition, when myoclonic jerks involving leg muscles appear, the PSM disappears.</br>Psychogenic myoclonus may simulate PSM but the muscle recruitment pattern, the spread velocity, and the record- ing of cortical premovement activity observed before voluntary movements may be useful to differentiate the two types of jerks. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Future studies are needed to better define the distinctions between PSM and related conditions such as sleep starts (hypnic jerks) and, in particular, the syndrome of inten- sified sleep starts.</br>Also, neuroimaging and possibly postmortem studies may detect the neural structures responsible for the initiation of the myoclonic jerks. </br>Bibliography Montagna P, Provini F, Plazzi G, Liguori R, Lugaresi E.

No specific precipitating factors have been reported.</br>The contribution of EFM to the symptomatology of any of these disorders is unknown. </br>The course is not well studied but appears to be benign and non-progressive.</br>The dis- order may be the sole abnormality in some cases of excessive daytime sleepiness, but causality is questionable.</br>No other serious consequences of the disorder have been described when it occurs in isolation. </br>328 In some cases, EFM is present in normal individuals.</br>Its relatively benign course sug- gests that it is not associated with a neurodegenerative process.</br>In most reported cases, there have been associated sleep abnormalities and sleep disruption, suggesting that EFM may be due to disruptions of normal motor-control mechanisms during sleep.</br>Whether there is a genetic or other basis predisposing individuals to develop the condi- tion is unknown.</br>In any case, it would appear to result from intensification of an other- wise normal motor phenomenon.</br>The predominant topographic distribution of EFM in distal and facial muscles suggests that cortical motor centers participate in its generation. </br>EFM is detected as isolated, very brief (usually 75 to 150 milliseconds), asymmetrical, asynchronous EMG potentials in various muscles of the face, trunk, arms, and legs.</br>The amplitude varies from approximately 50 to several hundred microvolts; the taller amplitudes are often associated with visible movement of the fingers, toes, or corners of the mouth, whereas the smaller ones may resemble fasciculation potentials and be without overt movement.</br>Large movements across large joint spaces preclude a diag- nosis of EFM.</br>Small twitch-like movements may be observed on video recording.</br>Episodes of these myoclonic potentials typically last from 10 minutes to several hours.</br>They often appear at sleep onset and continue through the NREM sleep stages, includ- ing slow wave sleep.</br>The presence of EFM in REM is difficult to determine because it is superimposed on the normal phasic clusters of physiological phasic REM twitches.</br>EFM is electromyographically similar to the latter.</br>Occasionally, the EMG activity also persists during EEG periods of wakefulness within the sleep period or is present in drowsiness prior to sleep onset.</br>The EEG usually shows no changes at the time of the movements, although high-amplitude EMG potentials may be associated with a K complex or even with transient EEG arousal.</br>There are no ocular or autonomic accom-

.</br>It seems possible that, depending on the digitalization rates, digital systems may record less fragmentary myoclonus than earlier paper records.</br>No laboratory tests other than polysomnography (optimally with multiple EMG leads) have been reported to be helpful in assessing EFM. </br>EFM generally has a maximum burst duration of only 150 milliseconds and does not recur periodically.</br>It can be distinguished from PLMS because PLMS are character- ized by a longer burst duration (typically 0.5 to 10 seconds) and a long period between bursts (5-90 seconds).</br>EFM, which occurs in NREM, must also be differentiated from normal physiological phasic REM twitches, which have a similar burst duration but are limited to the REM state and tend to occur in clusters within an epoch, as opposed to EFM in which bursts tend not to cluster within a particular epoch.</br>Larger body move-</br>ments across the large joints are not a feature of excessive fragmentary myoclonus.</br>The presence of such movements suggests other disorders. </br>329 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders Further investigation is necessary to determine whether EFM occurs as a consequence of sleep disruption or whether it is an independent cause of sleep disruption and daytime symptoms in its own right.</br>It must also be determined whether there are any physiolog- ical differences that distinguish fragmentary myoclonus seen in many normal individu- als from EFM.</br>It is not known whether some additional pathophysiological element is required to increase fragmentary myoclonus into an abnormal range.</br>The current thresh- old for the diagnosis of EFM should be further investigated because the scoring criteria lack specificity.</br>The apparent strong predominance in males also remains unexplained. </br>Bibliography Broughton R.

 for ALMA. </br>No longitudinal studies have been performed for either entity.</br>In some individuals, HFT is an occasional finding, but others appear to manifest the rhythmic movements Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders on many nights and over a span of at least months.</br>ALMA showed some tendency to persist between two different recordings in the originally reported series.</br>Because most individuals are unaware of the presence of the HFT movements, and patients with ALMA may have no associated complaint or awareness of the phenomenon, the evo- lution of HFT and ALMA may be difficult to follow except in the sleep laboratory or with home monitoring.</br>Although usually an incidental and benign finding, HFT may cause sleep disruption and sleep-onset insomnia if sufficiently prolonged or severe. </br>In HFT, the patient typically reports foot movements (directly experienced or observed by others) that occur at the transition between wake and sleep or during light sleep.</br>On occasion, movement has not been observed but HFT is seen as an incidental finding on sleep study conducted for other indications.</br>Polysomnography demonstrates a pattern of brief, repeated activation of the anterior tibialis in one leg.</br>The minimum frequency is 0.3 Hz; the maximum 4.0 Hz.</br>Multiple leg activations in a single leg occur in a train of at least four movements.</br>EMG recordings of the foot or leg muscles or video record- ings of movement may show trains of recurrent 1-Hz to 2-Hz EMG potentials or move- ments.</br>Typical associated EMG bursts are 300 to 700 milliseconds in duration, and the typical duration of trains is 10 to 15 seconds, although longer bursts and trains have been reported.</br>In morbid conditions, trains may persist much longer.</br>Events are recorded at the transition into sleep and during stages N1 and N2 sleep.</br>Distribution over the night has not been fully investigated.</br>Persistent HFT has been found in about half of the indi- viduals who have had multiple studies.</br>Alternation between legs has not been described, but its potential occurrence is suggested in two published studies of HFT. </br>In ALMA, polysomnography demonstrates a pattern of brief, repeated activation of the anterior tibialis in one leg alternating with similar activation in the other leg.</br>At a minimum, a single leg muscle activation in one leg is followed sequentially by a similar single activation in the other leg, reactivation in the original leg, and then reactivation in the alternate leg, with some continued alternation beyond this minimal sequence in most instances.</br>The minimum frequency of alternating EMG bursts is 0.5 Hz, and the maximum frequency is 3.0 Hz.</br>The patient may report foot movements (directly experi- enced or observed by others) that occur at the transition between wake and sleep or during light sleep.</br>As noted above, there is frequently no observation of movement reported but alternating leg muscle activation is recorded as an incidental finding on polysomnography. </br>ALMA can be demonstrated by polysomnography if the surface EMG is recorded inde- pendently from both right and left anterior tibialis muscles.</br>A sequence of ALMA may begin with one to several lengthy activations (one to two seconds) in one or both legs.</br>Some patients show unilateral activity at times.</br>ALMA usually closely precedes or follows an arousal or awakening and gradually diminishes as sleep returns.</br>However, ALMA can also emerge without arousals from any sleep stage.</br>Proclivity for any spe- cific portion of the nocturnal sleep cycle has not been identified.</br>Leg muscle activa- tions during REM sleep, in comparison to NREM sleep, are often briefer and some-</br>what less regular.</br>Sequences of ALMA sometimes recur at intervals similar to those of PLMs.</br>Extensor forearm EMG study may suggest alternating muscle activity in the upper extremities, though it is less prominent than activation in the legs.</br>ALMA shows some night-to-night consistency.</br>Repeat studies are likely to show persistent ALMA.</br>The number of sequences recorded, on average, and the timing of ALMA with respect to arousals tends to remain constant. </br>The specific polysomnographic criteria for HFT during sleep and ALMA are defined in the most recent version of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. </br>Presentation of HFT or ALMA with other concurrent sleep disorders is common. </br>Because of the similar frequency, duration, and body part involvement of the move- ments, HFT and ALMA may represent variants of the same disorder.</br>Insufficient sci-</br>entific evidence has accumulated to make this a certainty.</br>Thus, these entities are listed sequentially but separately. </br>Of note, some have questioned whether HFT and ALMA might represent a variant of rhythmic movement disorder in which movements are confined to the legs and an older population is affected. </br>HFT and ALMA should be distinguished from other sleep-onset movements: PLMD (especially the polyclonic form), PSM, and sleep related RMD.</br>Movement disorders that should be distinguished from HFT and ALMA include dyskinetic movements of the foot, such as painful legs and moving toes; tremors or rhythmic movements of other cause (Parkinson disease, clonus); and neuroleptic-induced akathisia.</br>None of these conditions involves regular alternation between sides, as seen in ALMA, or an associ- ation with the use of

. </br>333 Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders High-frequency leg movements (HFLM) also have been described as a repetitive ante- rior tibialis, polysomnographic activation phenomenon, possibly showing some asso- ciation with RLS, and with potential overlap with HFT and ALMA.</br>In contrast to HFT, however, HFLM occur in all sleep stages, and are mostly unilateral rather than bilateral.</br>In contrast to ALMA, HFLM are mostly unilateral rather than alternating, and often show sequences that last longer than those reported for ALMA.</br>The reported HFLM may be more common than ALMA, and the possibility exists that ALMA rep- resents a subtype of HFLM in which leg alternation occurs. </br>The degree to which these movements are quasi-voluntary remains to be determined because some are suppressible.</br>Whether HFT and ALMA are merely alternate forms of the same underlying motor mechanism is also unclear.</br>As reports of these move- ments have arisen from reviews of sleep center records, nothing is known about their manifestation in the general population.</br>The associations noted may be due to biased sampling caused by a skewing of the population toward those with sleep disorders, especially respiratory disorders.</br>The degree to which HFT and ALMA have clinical significance remains uncertain. </br>Bibliography Berry RB.</br>A woman with rhythmic foot movements.</br>J Clin Sleep Med 2007;3:749–51. </br>Broughton R.

auditory, such as banging, snapping or crackling noises; or visual, including flashing lights, hypnagogic dreams, or hallucina- tions.</br>A sharp cry may occur.</br>The patient may not recall a jerk that was noted by a bed partner if the sleep start does not cause awakening.</br>Multiple jerks occasionally occur in succession, usually early in the sleep period.</br>When sleep starts or hypnic jerks are frequent, intense, or repetitive, they may lead to sleep-onset insomnia. </br>Purely sensory sleep starts are subjective, localized, sensory impressions that occur at sleep onset and are not associated with motor activity.</br>The term “Intensified sleep starts” has been applied to both the motor and purely sensory forms when a complaint of difficulty falling asleep as a result of the starts is present. </br>A prevalence of 60% to 70% has been reported, but with a highly sporadic occurrence.</br>Sleep starts affect all ages and both sexes. </br>Excessive caffeine or other stimulant intake, prior intense physical work or exercise, sleep deprivation, and emotional stress can increase the frequency and severity of sleep starts. </br>Sleep starts are an essentially universal component of the sleep-onset process, although they are often not recalled.</br>Hypnic jerks may occur at any age, as a subjective com- plaint; however, they are usually encountered in adulthood.</br>The course is usually benign.</br>Intensified sleep starts may lead to avoidance/delay of sleep, a fear of falling asleep and chronic anxiety.</br>As a result, acute and chronic sleep deprivation may occur.</br>Sleep-onset insomnia may result either from repeated awakenings induced by the starts or from anxiety about falling asleep.</br>Injury, such as bruising a foot against a bedstead or kicking a sleeping companion, may occasionally occur. </br>The physiological mechanisms underlying sleep starts are uncertain.</br>No pathologic finding has been described except for a single case of auditory sleep starts associated with a brainstem lesion.</br>Hypnic jerks are hypothetically caused by sudden descending volleys originating in the brainstem reticular formation activated by the system insta- bility at the transition between wake and sleep.</br>However, the similarity between sleep starts and the startle response has led some to postulate that abnormalities of sensory Sleep Related Movement Disorders Sleep Related Movement Disorders processing are primary, with secondary motor manifestations involving the reticulo- spinal tract.</br>Sleep starts are a prominent symptom in hereditary hyperekplexia, some cases of which are caused by mutations in the glycine receptor.</br>It has also been postu- lated that sleep starts are a response to hypnagogic imagery. </br>Polysomnographic monitoring shows that hypnic jerks occur during transitions from wakefulness to sleep, mainly at the beginning of the sleep episode.</br>Superficial EMG recordings of the involved muscles show brief (generally 75-millisecond to 250-mil- lisecond) high-amplitude potentials, either singly or in succession.</br>The EEG typically shows drowsiness or stage N1 sleep patterns, sometimes with a negative-vertex sharp wave occurring at the time of the jerk.</br>Autonomic activation, including tachycardia, tachypnea or irregular breathing, and sudomotor activation may follow an intense jerk.</br>After the jerk, a brief arousal or a return to sustained wakefulness may occur.</br>Physical and neurological examinations and routine laboratory tests are otherwise normal.</br>Although polysomnography is not necessary for diagnosis in most individuals, it may be indicated in occasional cases with complaints of insomnia and frequent movements. </br>Hypnic jerks must be differentiated from a number of physiological or pathologic movements that occur at sleep onset or during sleep.</br>Physiological partial hypnic myoclonus consists of small, isolated contractions of a muscle or part thereof, occur- ring sporadically in distal muscles and resembling fasciculation potentials.</br>The con- tractions are particularly evident during stage N1 and REM sleep. </br>Fragmentary myoclonus consists of profuse, brief, small-amplitude muscle twitches that occur in an asynchronous, symmetrical, and bilateral manner, especially in distal muscles.</br>Fragmentary myoclonus occurs at sleep onset as well as within all sleep stages.</br>Contrary to the massive jerks of the sleep starts or hypnic jerks, the small muscle twitches of physiological partial hypnic myoclonus and of fragmentary myoclonus often represent only an EMG finding and are not associated with overt movements at the joints.</br>Normal body movements are complex, with body postural shifts usually at the transition between one sleep stage and another.</br>Benign sleep myoclonus of infancy consists of myoclonic jerks at the elbow, fingers, toes, and face during sleep in infants. </br>PSM is characterized by jerks, usually spontaneous, but sometimes also evoked, arising first in spinal innervated axial muscles of the trunk, neck, or abdomen and then prop- agated at slow velocity to more rostral and caudal muscles.</br>PSM is present during relaxed wakefulness, characterized by diffuse EEG alpha activity, and disappears with sleep onset or mental activation.</br>PSM is usually a chronic condition associated with sleep-onset insomnia. </br>336 Excessive startling and hypnic jerks may occur as part of the hyperekplexia syndrome, in which generalized myoclonus is readily elicited by stimuli during either wakeful- ness or sleep.</br>The major form of this condition is also characterized by stiffness and falls.</br>Brief epileptic myoclonus can be differentiated by coexistent EEG discharge, the presence of other features of epileptic seizures, and the occurrence of the myoclonus in both wakefulness and during sleep rather than only at sleep onset. </br>The muscle contractions of PLMD are much longer in duration, involve mainly the feet and lower legs, show periodicity, and occur within sleep.</br>RLS consists of slower and repetitive semivoluntary movements at sleep onset that are associated with deep, unpleasant, and sometimes unbearable sensations, which are temporarily relieved by getting up and exercising. </br>Bibliography Broughton R.

Sleep Related Gastroesophageal Reflux ...................................................358 Sleep Related Myocardial Ischemia ...........................................................363 The disorders presented in this section may have a unique presentation during the sleep period or may present exclusively in association with sleep.</br>Some of these disorders (e.g., sleep related epilepsy and sleep related headache) may be encountered during evaluation for other sleep disorders.</br>In addition, some of these disorders are in the dif- ferential diagnosis of other sleep-wake disorders.</br>Sleep related epilepsy must be con- sidered in the differential diagnosis of certain movement disorders and parasomnias.</br>Sleep related headaches may be a clue to the presence of sleep apnea.</br>Sleep related gastroesophageal reflux may either be a precipitant of a sleep apnea episode or be trig- gered by sleep apnea with aspiration pneumonia as its most serious consequence.</br>Sleep related myocardial ischemia is an important consideration because myocardial infarc- tion has a predilection for the early morning hours during the latter phase of the sleep period and may be precipitated by episodes of sleep apnea.</br>It is important to be aware of sleep related laryngospasm as a potentially life-threatening consequence of neurode- generative diseases such as multiple system atrophy.</br>Fatal familial insomnia, although rare, presents with severe insomnia and has a well-understood neuropathology. </br>341 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Fatal Familial Insomnia Alternate Names Fatal progressive insomnia with dysautonomia, familial thalamic degeneration of the anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei, thalamic insomnia. </br>Essential Features Fatal familial insomnia is a very rare, progressive disorder characterized by initial dif- ficulties in falling asleep and maintaining sleep, spontaneous lapses from quiet wake- fulness into a sleep state with enacted dreams (oneiric stupor), and loss of slow wave sleep features.</br>In later stages of the disease, it may not be possible to identify any dis- tinct sleep stages. </br>Although loss of temporal and spatial orientation develops, cognitive function is retained until impaired alertness makes testing impossible.</br>The disorder progresses to unarousable coma, and finally, death. </br>Associated Features Bronchopulmonary and other infections may also be present.</br>There is a loss of the circadian rhythmicity of endocrine rhythms.</br>Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., pyrexia, salivation, hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, tachypnea, and dyspnea) is present.</br>The disor- der includes somatomotor disturbances, with dysarthria, dysphagia, tremor, sponta- neous and reflex myoclonus, dystonic posturing, ataxia, and a positive Babinski sign.</br>Hallucinations may be present. </br>Clinical and Pathologic Subtypes None. </br>Demographics Age of onset is usually in adulthood, between 36 and 62 years of age.</br>The disorder is rare.</br>There are no sex differences. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Not known or applicable. </br>Familial Patterns Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is transmitted according to an autosomal dominant pattern.</br>Patients harbor a missense GAC to AAC mutation at codon 178 of the prion protein gene PRNP located on chromosome 20, cosegregating with the methionine Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders polymorphism at codon 129 of the same gene on the mutated allele (D178N 129M).</br>The clinical syndrome varies by the M129V genotype.</br>Patients who are methionine homozygous at the 129 codon are younger and display a shorter disease course than do patients who are methionine-valine heterozygous at codon 129. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications </br>The disorder is always fatal, usually within eight to 72 months.</br>The course is one of relentless worsening of symptoms.</br>Patients may die after a short (less than 12 months) or long (12 to 72 months) disease course.</br>The younger age at disease onset and, conse- quently, a lower rate of comorbidity, may explain the generally more prolonged disease course in FFI in comparison to other prion diseases.</br>Complications include infections (in particular of the lungs and bladder) that develop during the course of the disease, especially in the late stages, and represent the usual cause of death.</br>Other frequent com- plications include skin ulcers when patients become bedridden and aspiration of food due to the severe dysphagia; the latter may require nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology Severe bilateral loss of neurons, with reactive gliosis of the anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei and severe neuronal loss and reactive astrogliosis in the inferior olives, are found.</br>Spongiform changes in cortical layers in cases with a prolonged course have been described.</br>Deposition of proteinase K-resistant prion protein type 2 in the grey matter but not the white matter occurs in both familial and sporadic fatal insomnia.</br>Both familial and sporadic fatal insomnia have been transmitted to transgenic animals by intracerebral inoculum of brain homogenates. </br>Objective Findings In early stages of FFI, periods of relaxed wakefulness alternate with episodes of elec- troencephalographic (EEG) desynchronization, rapid eye movement (REM) bursts, loss of antigravity muscle tone, and irregular myoclonic and tremor-like limb-muscle activities associated with vivid dreams (oneiric stupor).</br>Sleep spindles and features of slow wave sleep are absent or progressively lost throughout the course of the illness.</br>In the final stages of the disorder, the EEG becomes unreactive and progressively flattens until death occurs; it may display periodic spike discharges. </br>Positron emission tomography (PET) with (18F)-2-fluorodeoxy-d-glucose shows tha- lamic hypometabolism.</br>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy with multisequences can detect prion-induced gliosis in vivo.</br>Circadian rhythms of body temperature, systemic blood pressure, and heart and respiratory rate and endocrine rhythms of growth hormone, prolactin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and adrenocorticotropic Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders hormone may be lost.</br>Serum catecholamine and cortisol values are elevated, with low or undetectable adrenocorticotropic hormone levels.</br>Pathologic examination demon- strates degeneration of the anterior and dorsomedial thalamic nuclei and atrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus.</br>Deposition of proteinase K-resistant prion protein type 2 is found in the brain. </br>Differential Diagnosis This disorder must be differentiated from REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is not associated with autonomic hyperactivity or a familial pattern.</br>The differential diagnosis includes dementia, familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with the 178 codon mutation in the PRNP cosegregating with the

Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Sleep Related Epilepsy Alternate Names Sleep epilepsy, nocturnal seizure, sleep related seizures. </br>Essential Features A seizure is a paroxysmal event resulting from a sudden excessive discharge of the neurons of the cerebral cortex, whereas epilepsy is a condition of recurrent unpro- voked seizures.</br>Sleep facilitates epileptic activity and seizures.</br>The characteristics of specific subtypes of sleep related epilepsy are discussed in the Clinical and Pathologic Subtypes section below. </br>Associated Features The different types of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE) may cause severe sleep disruption, affecting both macrostructure and microstructure of sleep, resulting in poor sleep quality, daytime fatigue, and sleepiness in some patients.</br>The movements also may be so severe that injuries can occur.</br>From one third to one half of patients with sleep related epilepsy also have occasional attacks during the day, although these are not necessarily of the same type as those occurring at night. </br>Neurocognitive impairment is typically diagnosed in almost all cases of continuous spike waves during NREM sleep (CSWS).</br>Motor impairment in the form of a unilat- eral deficit is sometimes seen as an associated feature of CSWS. </br>Clinical and Pathologic Subtypes Clinical and EEG criteria are used to define a variety of sleep related epilepsy subtypes. </br>Several types of epileptic syndromes have a marked tendency to manifest only or pre- dominantly during sleep, or after arousal from sleep.</br>These include NFLE, benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECT), benign epilepsy with occip- ital paroxysms (BEOP), early-onset or late-onset childhood occipital epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening, certain forms of temporal lobe epilepsy, tonic seizure (as a component of

-Gastaut syndrome), Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and continuous spike waves during NREM sleep (CSWS). </br>NFLE may present in three distinct ways: (1) nocturnal paroxysmal arousal, (2) noc- turnal paroxysmal dystonia, or (3) episodic nocturnal wanderings. </br>345 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders BECT can present with focal clonic facial twitching that is often preceded by perioral numbness.</br>These seizures are more often seen in drowsiness and sleep than wakeful- ness.</br>The clinical course is often benign with disappearance of the seizures in adulthood. </br>BEOP is characterized by focal seizures marked by deviation of the eyes and vom- iting.</br>Sleep is the main precipitating factor, with most of the seizures occurring soon after sleep onset or in the early hours of the morning.</br>There is frequent evolution to secondary generalized attacks.</br>The clinical evolution of the early-onset type is benign, whereas in the late-onset type with visual seizures, the prognosis is uncertain. </br>JME is characterized by massive bilaterally synchronous myoclonic jerks, which are most frequently noted on awakening. </br>CSWS (formerly known as electrical status epilepticus of sleep [ESES]) is charac- terized by continuous and diffuse slow spike-and-wave complexes persisting through NREM sleep (at least 85% of the duration), as well as neuropsychological and motor impairment.</br>Despite the continuous presence of epileptic spike-wave activity on EEG in sleep, there may be no associated visible sleep related movement.</br>However, clinical epileptic seizures are sometimes seen in the daytime. </br>Demographics There is no significant sex predominance. </br>Predisposing and Participating Factors Stress, sleep deprivation, irregularities of the sleep-wake rhythm, other sleep patholo- gies, and the use of stimulant drugs or other drugs that modify sleep architecture may predispose an individual to having seizures.</br>Perinatal or prenatal problems, congenital hemiparesis, and prior encephalopathy may be considered antecedents of the syndrome of CSWS.</br>OSA may exacerbate sleep related seizures and complicate their treatment. </br>Familial Patterns The idiopathic generalized epilepsies form the largest category of epilepsies that appear to be heritable but show no clear mendelian mode of transmission.</br>Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and idiopathic generalized epilepsy with adolescent onset appear to be genet- ically heterogeneous.</br>Among the partial epilepsies, BECT shows a familial pattern.</br>A form of autosomal dominant NFLE with 70% to 80% penetrance has been reported in many countries, and a genetic heterogeneity also has been reported.</br>Genetic factors have not been established in CSWS and seem to play a minor role.</br>Familial anteced- ents of epilepsy (including febrile convulsions) have been found in 15% of cases. </br>346 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Onset, Course, and Complications Idiopathic generalized epilepsies and partial epilepsy may start at any age.</br>The onset of benign epilepsies of childhood with centrotemporal or occipital spikes is between 4 and 12 years of age.</br>The onset of NFLE is generally from age 10 to 16 years, mostly before the age of 20 years.</br>The average age of recognition of CSWS is between 4 and 14 years, but the appearance of the first seizure is early, typically between two months and 12 years of age.</br>Most patients with recurrent sleep related epilepsy continue to have seizures restricted to sleep.</br>In some cases, they may have seizures during both sleep and wakefulness.</br>For focal epilepsies (excluding BECT and the early-onset type of BEOP), the prognosis is less favorable compared to generalized epilepsies.</br>At least 35% of the focal seizures confined to sleep are resistant to antiepileptic drugs. </br>Definitive data on the natural history of NFLE are not available, although a high prev- alence of parasomnias has been documented in NFLE patients. </br>CSWS resolves in many cases within three years after onset, and in almost all cases by the mid-teen years.</br>Despite normalization of the EEG and elimination of seizures, neuropsychological impairment may persist.</br>Interictal paroxysmal activity may induce prolonged cognitive and motor impairment.</br>Hyperkinesias, aggressiveness, and psy- chotic states may appear.</br>OSA may exacerbate sleep related seizures and complicate their treatment. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology In idiopathic generalized epilepsy, genetic factors are contributory.</br>Pathogenic markers, associated neurologic deficits, or characteristic brain imaging findings have not been identified.</br>However, microdysgenesis has been described in some forms of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.</br>EEG recordings with sphenoidal or zygomatic leads may show epileptic activity over the mesiotemporal regions in partial complex seizures. </br>Video-polysomnographic (vPSG) analysis confirms that the motor pattern of NFLE resembles that noted in orbital and mesial frontal seizures.</br>Nocturnal frontal lobe sei-</br>zures involve a large neuronal network, and some of their clinical expressions are pos- sible consequences of disinhibition of innate motor patterns produced by the central pattern generator.</br>Recent reports derived from stereo-EEG studies seem to show that in some cases, the seizures (in particular nocturnal wanderings) may arise from temporal or insular regions (rather than frontal regions) with a secondary spread to the cingulate regions.</br>They may sometimes mimic parasomnias. </br>347 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Secondary bilateral synchrony is the mechanism generating CSWS.</br>This hypothesis is supported by EEG, intracranial recordings, EEG with coherence computer-assisted analysis, and metabolic (positron emission tomography</br>[PET] and single-photon emis- sion computed tomography [SPECT]) studies.</br>CSWS associated with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (an acquired epileptic aphasia) is probably secondary to an alteration of function over the temporal area. </br>Objective Findings Patients with suspected sleep related epilepsy often need to be evaluated in the sleep laboratory with video and full-head EEG monitoring in order to obtain the correct diagnosis.</br>The characteristic interictal epileptiform activity in idiopathic general- ized epilepsies usually increases during NREM sleep, whereas it decreases during REM sleep and wakefulness.</br>Interictal epileptiform activity may be associated with phasic arousals. </br>In partial epilepsies, the interictal epileptiform activity occurs in a localized distribu- tion with an increase in spike frequency in stages N2 and N3 compared to REM sleep.</br>Most of the seizures are activated in stage N2 sleep.</br>Monitoring may also detect tran- sient autonomic alterations in cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and respiration during seizures.</br>If epilepsy is suspected, a standard daytime 16-channel to 20-channel EEG (with partial or total sleep deprivation the night before, as indicated) should be per- formed.</br>Ambulatory 24-hour EEG recordings may be useful to detect distribution of interictal epileptiform activity during the sleep-wake cycle. </br>Nocturnal vPSG is the gold standard test for NFLE.</br>Most of the seizures appear during NREM sleep, with preponderance in NREM stages N1 and N2 (greater than 60%).</br>Rarely do they emerge from REM sleep.</br>In some cases, particularly in paroxysmal arousals, the motor attacks may show a periodicity (every 20 seconds to two minutes).</br>Due to the fact that the discharges originate deep in the frontal lobe and are not visible using scalp EEG, the EEG during the attacks is uninformative in almost half of the cases.</br>In a few cases, recording using intracranial or depth electrodes confirms the paroxysms during or preceding the motor components.</br>The interictal sleep EEG is generally normal, but in 30% to 40% of subjects, focal epileptic abnormalities are seen, predominantly in the anterior regions.</br>The video recording of the different types of attacks in NFLE permits categorization of the seizures and characterization of the main features. </br>During CSWS, diffuse spike waves at two to 2.5 Hz occur in bursts, with or without clinical manifestations.</br>The discharges are continuous and occupy from 85% to 100% </br>348 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders of NREM sleep stages.</br>Abnormalities arise as soon as the patients fall asleep and dis- appear abruptly on awakening.</br>REM sleep is typically preserved, and the frequency of spike-wave discharges significantly decreases but the frontal predominance of the infrequent bursts may become more prominent.</br>In general, EEG patterns during REM sleep are similar to those in the awake records.</br>The sleep structure is normal, but the presence of almost continuous spike-wave discharges makes the recognition of normal NREM sleep EEG elements (such as K complexes, spindles, or vertex sharp transients) difficult. </br>Differential Diagnosis NFLE may be mistaken for a disorder of arousal from NREM such as sleepwalking, confusional arousal, or sleep terror.</br>Ictal and interictal EEGs are often normal because the focus for the epileptic discharge may be deep in the brain.</br>Disorders of arousal show a different pattern of episodes in that they occur out of stage N3 sleep, are not ste- reotyped, often have a sustained autonomic component, and are frequently seen during the first part of the night.</br>Partial arousal disorders tend to disappear or decrease in fre- quency after adolescence.</br>VPSG is often useful.</br>Sleep talking, bruxism, and rhythmic movement disorders can be differentiated from nocturnal seizures by history and vPSG recordings.</br>Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus may be confused with clonic or myoc- lonic seizures during sleep.</br>In the elderly (older than 60 years), the main differentiation from RBD is by vPSG recording.</br>PLMD, sleep starts, and propriospinal myoclonus at sleep onset do not show EEG epileptiform activity and belong in the category of move- ment disorders during sleep.</br>Jerks, dyskinesias, or arousal on resumption of breathing in patients with OSA also enter into the differential diagnosis of sleep related epilepsy.</br>Rare cases of anoxic syncope with some clonic jerks at the end of a prolonged (longer than two minutes) obstructive event have been described. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Not applicable or known.

 M. Sleep-related epilepsy.</br>Handb Clin Neurol 2011;99:1109–37. </br>Sleep Related Headaches Alternate Names Various (see Clinical and Pathologic Subtypes). </br>Essential Features Sleep related headaches are a group of unilateral or bilateral cephalalgias of varying severity and duration that occur during sleep or upon awakening from sleep.</br>It is a heterogenous group of different headache entities with the common feature of occur- rence during sleep or upon awakening.</br>The characteristics of specific subtypes of sleep related headache are discussed in the Clinical and Pathologic Subtypes section below. </br>Associated Features Individual features associated with specific sleep related headache types are discussed in the following section. </br>Clinical and Pathologic Subtypes Most sleep related headaches are daytime headache conditions that also may occur during sleep.</br>These include the primary headaches such as migraine, cluster head- ache, and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania.</br>There are other primary headaches that occur solely with sleep; for example, hypnic headaches.</br>In addition, secondary head- aches related to medical, neurological, psychiatric, and sleep disorders can cause sleep related headaches. </br>Migraines are common recurrent headaches of moderate to severe intensity that last between four and 72 hours.</br>Pain is typically unilateral and pulsating, aggra- vated by routine physical activity and associated with nausea, and/or photophobia Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders or phonophobia.</br>They occur during the day or during sleep; approximately 50% of migraine attacks occur between 4:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.</br>Migraine headaches do not have a fixed association with a particular sleep stage.</br>The patient may awaken with a migraine out of REM sleep, or the headaches may occur in relationship to stage N3 sleep.</br>A “classic migraine” headache is preceded by an aura (if the patient is awake), which usually lasts four to 60 minutes and typically consists of homonymous visual field defects and scintillating scotomas.</br>In some patients, the aura may continue or even begin during the headache phase.</br>In contrast, “common migraine” does not start with an aura.</br>Other signs of neurological dysfunction may include unilateral paresthesias, weakness, and aphasia.</br>Features of brainstem involvement may include vertigo, tinni- tus, dysarthria, decreased hearing, diplopia, ataxia, bilateral paresthesias, and impaired level of consciousness.</br>A familial syndrome with hemiplegia is well described.</br>The hemiplegia is ipsilateral or contralateral to the side of the headache. </br>Cluster headaches are severe, unilateral, periorbital or temporal headaches that start quickly and peak within 10 to 15 minutes.</br>They have a relatively shorter duration, usually lasting 15 minutes to three hours (mean, 60 minutes).</br>The headaches occur daily during cluster periods—usually one to three attacks per day over a period of one to two months.</br>Most patients have one cluster period per year, though this can vary from patient to patient.</br>The headaches tend to occur at the same hour each day, with 75% of cluster episodes reported to occur between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m.</br>One or more cranial autonomic features (e.g., ipsilateral conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, ptosis, or eyelid edema) invariably accompany attacks of cluster headaches.</br>A strong predilection for attacks to occur during sleep is well recognized, and these attacks are strongly related to REM sleep. </br>Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania closely resembles cluster headaches and consists of severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain associated with one or more cranial autonomic features.</br>However, the attacks are usually of shorter duration (lasting two to 30 minutes) and occur more frequently, most often at a frequency of more than five per day.</br>In contrast to cluster headaches, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania is exqui- sitely sensitive to

.</br>Attacks are also strongly associated with REM sleep. </br>Hypnic headaches are an uncommon type of headache that awakens the patient from sleep with a generalized or lateralized headache that lasts at least 15 minutes (range, one to 180 minutes) with a frequency of at least 15 times per month.</br>Onset is typically after the age of 50, although similar headaches are described rarely in younger indi- viduals, including children.</br>In comparison to cluster headaches, hypnic headaches are Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders less severe, often bilateral and not associated with cranial autonomic features.</br>Isolated nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia may be present.</br>They may occur one to three times during the night, with many patients reporting that the headaches occur at the same time of the night.</br>The headaches tend to occur during REM sleep.</br>However, they also have been reported to occur during stage N3 sleep.</br>A positive therapeutic response to

 has been reported in many patients. </br>Other medical (e.g., hypertension), neurologic (e.g., brain tumors, arteriovenous mal- formations, cerebral venous thrombosis and trauma), psychiatric (e.g., depression), and sleep disorders (e.g., snoring and OSA) also can give rise to headaches that may occur during sleep or upon awakening from sleep.</br>Patients with increased intracranial pressure (due, for example, to brain tumor, hematoma, arteriovenous malformations, or cerebral venous thrombosis) may complain of headache in the morning or head- ache that starts after recumbence and improves after the patient is up for 30 to 60 minutes.</br>Nausea, vomiting, signs of focal neurological deficits, and papilledema may be present.</br>The headache may worsen with bending down or sneezing or with other activities that may cause further increase in intracranial pressure. </br>Sleep related headaches can disrupt nocturnal sleep, although the exact prevalence of this complication is unknown. </br>Demographics The exact prevalence of sleep related headaches is not known.</br>One study from a head- ache clinic suggested that 17% of all headache patients complain of nocturnal or early morning headaches, and roughly half of these were related to an identifiable sleep disorder.</br>However, many primary headache disorders can occur during sleep as well.</br>Sleep related migraines have been reported to increase in frequency with age. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Migraine headaches have several predisposing factors that vary from patient to patient.</br>However, stress, relaxation, changes in weather and barometric pressure, changes in sleep pattern, hypoglycemia, and specific foods (e.g., chocolate, Chinese food, alcohol) have been known to trigger migraine headaches.</br>Alcohol can also predispose an indi- vidual to having cluster headache and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania.</br>OSA and atten- dant hypoxia have been reported to be a trigger for cluster headache.</br>However, sleep apnea may also predispose a person to having other types of headache and may inde- pendently lead to morning headaches.</br>Change of sleep pattern and insomnia can pre- dispose the patient to developing headaches. </br>352 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Familial Patterns There is a positive family history for migraine in up to 80% of patients with this disor- der.</br>Familial hemiplegic migraine is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with a variety of genetic mutations identified on chromosomes 1 and 19.</br>Cluster headache does not have as strong of a familial disposition as migraine headache, but first-degree relatives of probands with cluster headache are seven times more likely to develop cluster headaches, and the concordance rates in monozygotic twins is 100%.</br>The inheritance patterns of hypnic headache are not known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Migraine headache usually starts in the second or third decade of life, with a slightly earlier onset in men than in women.</br>The mean age of onset of cluster headache is 28 years.</br>Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania has a wide range of onset, from childhood to old age.</br>Most patients with hypnic headache are elderly, with the age of onset from 40 to 82 years.</br>Brain tumors are more prevalent in the elderly, most occurring from the fifth decade to late life. </br>Most sleep related headaches are benign and tend to decrease in frequency with age.</br>There may be spontaneous remissions that last from months to years.</br>Pregnancy has a variable effect on these headaches.</br>Migraines tend to decrease with age and, in women, may stop after menopause.</br>Cluster headaches, as the name suggests, occur in clusters and are accompanied by pain-free intervals lasting months to a couple of years.</br>They also tend to decrease with age.</br>Hypnic headache occurs infrequently.</br>Headaches in patients with brain tumors are related to an increase in intracranial pressure and tend to improve with treatment of the primary lesion and a decrease in intracranial pres- sure.</br>Some patients with OSA report improvement of the headache after treatment of the apnea. </br>The sleep related headaches can cause sleep disruption and insomnia with decreased sleep efficiency.</br>Cluster headaches occurring regularly in sleep can also lead to tran- sient situational insomnia that may resolve after the remission or the treatment of the cluster headache.</br>Depending on the etiology of the sleep related headache (e.g., brain tumor), other complications may occur. </br>Developmental Issues Not applicable or known. </br>353 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Pathology and Pathophysiology Several anatomic areas are common to the physiology of both sleep and headaches;

 also are involved in both the regulation of sleep and the evolution of headaches.</br>Dysfunction of REM sleep and arousal mechanisms are common to many headache disorders.</br>Data from transgenic models indicate that dis- ruption of sleep occurs in two forms of familial migraine.</br>However, current mechanis- tic explanations of the relationship between sleep and headache are speculative. </br>Objective Findings Polysomnographic aspects of sleep related headaches need to be better defined.</br>Migraine headache is reported to occur in association with REM sleep or stage N3 sleep.</br>An excess of stage N3 sleep also has been reported in patients with migraine.</br>However, large controlled studies are not available.</br>Fifty percent of cluster headaches and a majority of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania are associated with REM sleep.</br>OSA and hypoxia during sleep may aggravate other sleep related headaches or may be an independent cause of headache.</br>Hypnic headache occurs during sleep, with recent reports of headache during REM sleep and uncommonly during stage N3 sleep.</br>Thus, the majority of sleep related headaches seem to have some relationship with REM sleep, but there are no defining or pathognomonic polysomnographic aspects of indi- vidual headache syndromes. </br>Neuroimaging studies (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging head scans or angiography) may be performed to rule out structural, vascular, or infectious disease processes that may cause headaches. </br>Differential Diagnosis Sleep related headaches are a heterogeneous group of different headache entities with a common expression of occurrence during sleep.</br>They need to be differentiated from other headache conditions that are not sleep related.</br>These include tension-type head- aches and headaches associated with paranasal sinus inflammation, tooth infection, ear infection, febrile illness, benign intracranial hypertension, intracranial hypoten- sion, vasculitis, head trauma, alcohol intoxication, or bruxism.</br>Although the initial presentation may be one of headache, detailed history and examination will identify one of these contributing conditions. </br>Tension-type headaches are bilateral headaches with a feeling of a band-like tighten- ing sensation around the head.</br>In patients older than 50 years, giant cell arteritis may Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders present with lateralized or bilateral headache with tenderness over the temporal area, accompanied by polymyalgia rheumatica and visual problems, including loss of vision. </br>Exploding head syndrome is in the differential diagnosis of headache because it may occur in association with the sleep period.</br>Patients report hearing an explosion in the head which is unaccompanied by pain. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Not applicable or known. </br>Bibliography Brennan KC, Charles A. Sleep and headache.</br>Semin Neurol 2009;29:406–17. </br>Sleep Related Laryngospasm Alternate Names Stridor, laryngeal dysfunction. </br>Essential Features Sleep related laryngospasm is a disorder in which tracheal muscle dysfunction or para- tracheal soft-tissue swelling causes stridor or interruption of airflow, with associated awakening from sleep.</br>Patients may have total or near-total cessation of airflow while asleep, and suddenly arouse.</br>This brief respiratory blockage (lasting an estimated five to 45 seconds) is often followed by a period of stridor that lasts several minutes and gradually evolves to normal breathing.</br>Episodes are associated with panic and fear of suffocation; cyanosis may be observed.</br>In some cases of laryngospasm during sleep, patients may have frequent laryngeal stridor (which may be difficult for families to dif- ferentiate from snoring), associated tachypnea, and intermittent upper airway blockage. </br>Associated Features Fear and panic upon awakening often accompany events and may, at times, lead to insomnia.</br>In some cases of sleep related laryngospasm, gastroesophageal reflux has been identified.</br>Less commonly, sleep related laryngospasm has been related to underlying OSA. </br>Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes Sleep related laryngospasm may be associated with multisystem atrophy, a neurode- generative disorder. </br>355 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Demographics Prevalence data do not exist.</br>Typical age of onset is unknown, although when the con- dition is due to multisystem atrophy, affected individuals are typically older. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors Sleep related laryngospasm may be associated with gastroesophageal reflux.</br>Laryngeal dysfunction seen in other disorders, including laryngeal tumors and multisystem atrophy, may cause sleep related stridor and intermittent laryngospasm.</br>Precipitating factors include use of hypnotic or other central nervous system depressant medications.</br>Tonic-clonic seizures may be a rare cause of sleep related laryngospasm in children. </br>Familial Patterns Not applicable or known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications Laryngospasm is a common cause of death in multiple system atrophy. </br>Developmental Issues Not known. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology When not associated with neurodegenerative disorders of known pathology (e.g., mul- tisystem atrophy), the pathology and pathophysiology is uncertain.</br>Sleep related laryn- gospasm can be related to tracheal muscle dysfunction, postnasal drip, or reflux of gas- troesophageal contents causing irritation of soft tissue in the upper airway.</br>Laryngeal tumors and multisystem atrophy can cause laryngeal dysfunction, resulting in sleep related laryngospasm. </br>Objective Findings Sleep related laryngospasm may be observed on PSG with accompanying audio record- ing.</br>It is seen in all stages of sleep but is most severe in REM sleep.</br>

 before sleep time.</br>Other predictors of heartburn during sleep include the presence of insomnia, hypertension, asthma, snoring, or daytime sleepiness.</br>The relationship between GER and sleep disturbance is bidirectional.</br>Sleep related GER is associated with short sleep duration, difficulty falling asleep, arousals, poor sleep quality, and early morning awakenings.</br>Conversely, sleep deprivation induces a state of esophageal hyperalgesia to acid, thus worsening heartburn symptoms. </br>Familial Patterns Not applicable or known. </br>Onset, Course, and Complications GER occurs in all age groups, including infants and children.</br>Sleep disruption occurs more frequently in infants and children with GER, compared to infants and children without GER.</br>The incidence of GER increases with age.</br>GER may be more severe and is associated with more complications in older adults. </br>GER is a chronic disease which is rarely cured, but it may be controlled with lifestyle, and medical and/or surgical therapies.</br>In patients with sleep related GER, medical GER therapy improved sleep disturbances and daytime functioning in placebo-con- trolled trials.</br>Long-term outcome data are currently lacking.</br>If GER is left untreated, the disease generally progresses and can be associated with many complications.</br>Esophageal complications include esophagitis, esophageal erosions, esophageal stric- ture, ulcerations with stricture, and Barrett esophagus, which is thought to be a precur- sor to esophageal adenocarcinoma.</br>Reflux can also result in dysphagia, weight loss, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.</br>Sleep related GER is more commonly associated with erosive esophagitis, stricture, Barrett esophagitis, and esophageal adenocarci- noma, compared to diurnal reflux.</br>Extraesophageal complications include pulmonary complications previously discussed in the Essential Features section. </br>359 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Pathology and Pathophysiology Two major pathophysiologic mechanisms cause individual reflux episodes.</br>Transient LES relaxations (LES relaxations occurring without esophageal contractions) account for 53% to 74% of GER episodes.</br>Transient LES relaxations decrease the LES pres- sure to the gastric pressure gradient, facilitating the retrograde flow of gastric contents.</br>An LES pressure of 10 mm Hg or less is the second mechanism by which intra-abdom- inal pressure overcomes the LES pressure, resulting in the retrograde flow of gastric contents into the esophagus. </br>Pathophysiology of sleep related GER is similar to diurnal GER (i.e., transient LES relaxations and a low LES pressure).</br>However, sleep impacts esophageal physiology through the impairment of esophageal acid clearance mechanisms when GER events occur.</br>With sleep onset, the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) pressure decreases and is lowest during N3 sleep, thus predisposing to aspiration.</br>The UES contractile reflex remains intact during sleep, including REM sleep.</br>Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure remains unchanged during sleep.</br>Sleep increases the vagal threshold for trig- gering transient LES relaxations, so they usually do not occur during stable sleep and are usually confined to arousals.</br>When GER events occur during sleep, esophageal refluxate clearance is prolonged and an arousal is required.</br>Sleep facilitates proxi- mal refluxate migration toward the UES.</br>Saliva secretion, with its acid-neutralizing bicarbonate, ceases during sleep.</br>Swallowing, required for esophageal peristalsis and refluxate clearance, does not occur during sleep and is dependent on an arousal.</br>Sleep also delays gastric emptying by disrupting gastromyoelectric function.</br>Events causing arousals, including periodic limb movements and apneas, could trigger transient LES relaxations and thus GER events.</br>Because refluxate clearance requires an arousal, medications decreasing the arousal response (including

4 - less than 3.5% of the time; and 2) proximal pH &lt; 4 - less than 0.6% of the time.</br>If esophageal pH monitoring is integrated with polysomnography, esophageal acid events can be cor- related with sleep events, including arousals, apneas, laryngospasm, and increased chin EMG tone.</br>Esophageal pH monitoring also can be performed simultaneously with actigraphy to correlate acid reflux events with sleep and wake periods.</br>Catheter- free wireless pH systems are also available and are deployed into the esophagus, usually by endoscopy. </br>Esophageal impedance monitoring can be combined with pH probes detecting liquid, gas, or liquid gas in the esophagus, and can assess both acid and nonacid reflux events.</br>Use of esophageal impedance monitoring is often performed in esophageal centers, and this technique would be difficult to integrate with polysomnography. </br>Other objective measures include esophageal endoscopy with or without biopsy in order to evaluate for esophagitis and other esophageal complications.</br>A histologic evaluation is required to establish a diagnosis of Barrett esophagus. </br>361 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis is primarily with peptic ulcer disease and angina.</br>The chest pain associated with GER is sometimes indistinguishable from that of angina.</br>Duodenal ulcer disease is commonly associated with a burning epigastric pain, and this can sometimes be similar to the pain experienced by patients with GER.</br>Other conditions that may be associated with GER include OSA, sleep related abnormal swallowing, and sleep related laryngospasm.</br>PSG evaluation with respiratory and pH monitoring can differentiate these disorders. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions Not applicable or known. </br>Bibliography Allen L, Poh CH, Gasiorowska A, et al.</br>Increased oesophageal acid exposure at the beginning of the recumbent period is primarily a recumbent-awake phenomenon.</br>Aliment Pharmacol Ther 2010;32:787–94. </br>Bajaj JS, Bajaj S, Dua KS, et al.</br>Influence of sleep stages on esophago-upper esophageal sphincter contractile reflex and secondary esophageal peristalsis.</br>Gastroenterology 2006;130:17–25. </br>Fass R, Johnson DA, Orr WC, et al.</br>The effect of dexlansoprazole MR on nocturnal heartburn and GERD- related sleep disturbances in patients with symptomatic GERD.</br>Am J Gastroenterol 2011;106:421–31. </br>Fass R, Quan SF, O’Connor GT, et al.</br>Predictors of heartburn during sleep in a large prospective cohort study.</br>Chest 2005;127:1654–66. </br>Fujiwara Y, Arakawa T, Fass R.

 those in whom autonomic dysfunction (related to either age or diabetes) may impair blood pressure homeostatic mechanisms. </br>Predisposing and Precipitating Factors </br>Predisposing factors include established coronary artery disease or valvular disease such as aortic stenosis.</br>Because coronary filling occurs during diastole, conditions associated with reduced diastolic blood pressure, such as severe aortic regurgita- tion, may elicit nocturnal angina, particularly in the presence of preexisting coro-</br>nary artery disease.</br>Similarly, any predisposition to hypotension, which is most likely to occur during slow wave (N3) sleep, may heighten risk.</br>Usual risk factors for coronary artery disease that predispose an individual to the development of sleep related myocardial ischemia include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and hyperlipidemia. </br>Retrospective and prospective studies suggest that OSA may be a trigger for myo- cardial infarction and sudden death that occurs at night.</br>Deeper oxyhemoglobin desaturations, which may be encountered in REM, particularly with coexisting pulmonary disease or truncal-abdominal obesity, are more likely to trigger cardiac ischemia.</br>In patients with vasospastic angina, use of nonselective β-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents may theoretically increase the likelihood of vasospasm.</br>In patients with nocturnal angina secondary to hypotension, an excess of antihy- pertensive medications, as well as long-acting

, needs to be considered in the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. </br>Familial Patterns Familial patterns reflect those of the underlying disease process. </br>364 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Onset, Course, and Complications For angina related to OSA, the first presentation of nocturnal angina may occur only when the severity of both the sleep apnea and the coronary artery disease are suffi- cient to elicit sleep related myocardial ischemia.</br>This is likely to be most common in middle-aged to older men, particularly those who are overweight, although several studies have documented life-threatening OSA related cardiac ischemia in women.</br>It is notable that several studies have reported cardiac ischemia in patients with OSA even in the absence of severe coronary artery stenosis.</br>ST segment changes occur- ring as a result of OSA would be expected to resolve with treatment of the OSA.</br>Regardless of the underlying etiology, potential complications of sleep related myo- cardial ischemia include acute left ventricular dysfunction, ischemic mitral regur- gitation and pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, and even progression to myocardial infarction and death. </br>Pathology and Pathophysiology For sleep related myocardial ischemia related to OSA, the apnea-related hypoxemia and surges in blood pressure and heart rate at termination of apnea may all result in rel- ative myocardial oxygen deficiency.</br>A substrate of preexisting severe coronary artery disease is expected to exacerbate this problem.</br>Variant angina may be more likely to occur during sleep because of the significant and abrupt fluctuations in cardiovascular neural control during REM sleep.</br>For nocturnal angina related to hypotension, perfu- sion of the coronary arteries during diastole makes maintenance of diastolic pressures during sleep important for adequate myocardial perfusion.</br>Autonomic insufficiency due to old age, diabetes, and medication effects blunts the ability of the cardiovascular system to maintain adequate blood pressure. </br>Objective Findings Electrocardiographic monitoring during sleep reveals horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression of greater than or equal to 1 mm, or ST segment elevation of 1 mm or more.</br>The electrocardiographic evidence of sleep related coronary artery ischemia is sometimes unaccompanied by chest discomfort or other symptoms (silent ischemia) and may be incidentally noted on either Holter monitoring or telemetry. </br>In general, ST segment abnormalities indicative of myocardial ischemia are 1 mm or more horizontal or down-sloping depression or ST segment elevation, which may be detected on the single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) employed in most sleep labo- ratories.</br>However, because the sensitivity of single-lead ECG in detecting ischemic changes is poor, the patient with symptoms compatible with angina with a normal-ap- pearing single ECG channel should be further evaluated with multichannel ECG. </br>365 Appendix A: Sleep Related Medical and Neurological Disorders Sleep related myocardial ischemia in patients without sleep related breathing disor- ders may be associated with REM sleep.</br>Slow wave sleep with a fall in blood pressure and heart rate can be associated with ischemia.</br>Sleep related breathing disorders, par- ticularly OSA, may elicit oxygen desaturation and consequent sleep related myocar- dial ischemia.</br>The presence of cardiac arrhythmias should prompt an evaluation for nocturnal ischemia. </br>Differential Diagnosis Sleep related myocardial ischemia must be differentiated from gastroesophageal reflux, which may also be associated with chest discomfort.</br>The nature of the pain, associated symptoms and prior history are helpful in making a distinction, although 12-lead ECG may be necessary in some cases.</br>Nocturnal panic attacks may be asso- ciated with chest wall pain and respiratory distress.</br>Although the majority of patients with nocturnal panic will have a history of daytime panic attacks, a small percentage have only nocturnal events.</br>Nocturnal panic attacks typically occur during transition from N2 to N3 sleep. </br>Other causes of nocturnal respiratory distress, including heart failure and pulmonary disease, may be confused with myocardial ischemic episodes, although typical anginal chest pain is not evident in these cases. </br>Chest pain due to thoracic mass, pleuritic pain, aortic aneurysm, or other thoracic disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis.</br>Chest wall pain may be sec- ondary to a variety of causes such as trauma, muscle spasm, or immobility. </br>Unresolved Issues and Further Directions More comprehensive data are needed to identify the prevalence and demographics of the various causes of sleep related myocardial ischemia.</br>Further information is also needed to explore the relationship between sleep related myocardial ischemia and the circadian variation in myocardial infarction and sudden death, particularly the role of treatment on outcomes. </br>Bibliography Caples S, Rosen C,

. </br>Dystonia: Involuntary muscle contractions that result in slow repetitive movements or abnormal postures. </br>372 Early Morning Awakening: The termination of sleep at least 30 minutes before the desired rising time with a concomitant reduced total sleep time compared to the usual premorbid sleep pattern. </br>Electromyogram (EMG): Physiological recording of muscle activity, based on electrical activity that accompanies muscle contraction.</br>For sleep monitoring purposes, EMG is typically recorded from skin surface rather than intramuscular electrodes. </br>Entrained/Entrainment: The successful end result (entrained) or process of (entrainment) synchronization of an internal circadian clock to the environment (e.g., light dark cycle), producing a stable phase relationship between the circadian clock and environmental time. </br>Fatigue: A lack of energy, accompanied by a desire to reduce or limit activity levels.</br>This symptom should be differentiated from reports of subjective sleepiness as well as from unintended sleep episodes. </br>Homeostasis:</br>The tendency of a living organism to maintain internal equilibrium by adjusting and regulating its physiological processes. </br>Hypercapnia: Elevation of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) to a level &gt; 45</br>mm</br>Hg during wakefulness. </br>Hypersomnolence: Excessive sleepiness during the normal wake period.</br>Hypersomnia: A disorder characterized by excessive sleepiness (e.g. idiopathic hypersomnia). </br>Hypnagogic Hallucinations:</br>Vivid dreamlike experiences occurring at the transition from wake to sleep. </br>Hypnopompic Hallucinations:</br>Vivid dreamlike experiences occurring at the transition from sleep to wake. </br>Myalgia: Muscle pain. </br>Nonrestorative Sleep: Sleep that is perceived to be poor in quality and unrefreshing, resulting in a sense of feeling unrested upon awakening. </br>373 Glossary Glossary Odds Ratio: A statistical term that provides a measure of the strength of relationship between two variables; the odds of an event occurring in one group compared to the odds of it occurring in another group. </br>Oneirism: Acting-out of dreams, usually from REM sleep. </br>Out of Center Sleep Testing: A sleep study performed outside of the sleep center, usually at a patient’s home and with limited (typically respiratory related) channels (parameters) recorded. </br>Parasomnia Pseudo-Suicide: A death, erroneously attributed by authorities to suicide, which results from complex parasomnia, usually from NREM sleep. </br>Parkinson Disease: A neurodegenerative movement disorder which may result in bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and/or postural instability, and eventually cognitive decline. </br>Phase Advance/Delay: A shift in the timing of the internal circadian clock in which circadian phase is moved earlier (advance, such as required for eastward jet travel or to assume an earlier sleep schedule) or later (delay, such as required for westward jet travel or to assume a later sleep schedule). </br>Phase Response Curve: Graphic representation that describes the circadian phase shifting response to a time cue (e.g., light) as a function of the internal circadian time at which the cue is presented. </br>Phase Tolerance:</br>The ability to be awake or asleep at an inappropriate internal circadian time. </br>Physiological Hyperarousal: A state of chronic physiologic arousal as reflected by measures such as increased mean latency on MSLT, increased metabolic rate and glucose metabolism in the CNS (PET scan), decreased heart rate variability and increased heart rate. </br>PHOX2B:</br>A paired-like homobox gene, mutation of which is the defining abnormality of Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome. </br>Prevalence: The proportion of the population affected by a disease or condition at a given time; prevalence indicates how widespread a disease or condition is, thereby serving as a measure of its burden on society. </br>374 REM Sleep without Atonia, REM-without Atonia: The intermittent or continuous loss of the normal muscle atonia of REM sleep. </br>Reverse First Night Effect: A propensity to sleep better than usual on the first night in the sleep laboratory. </br>Sleep Attacks: Inappropriate falling asleep with few or no prodromal symptoms of sleepiness. </br>Sleep Diary (sleep log): An instrument used by individuals to keep records of their nightly sleep duration and quality over a period of days to weeks. </br>Sleep Drunkenness (prolonged sleep inertia): Prolonged difficulty waking up after a night’s sleep or a nap with repeated returns to sleep, irritability, automatic behavior and confusion. </br>Sleep Homeostasis: A process which describes the propensity for sleep driven by duration of prior time awake and sleep history. </br>Sleep Hygiene: A set of rules/instructions about lifestyle (caffeine intake, alcohol and tobacco use, diet, etc.)</br>and environmental factors (light, noise, temperature) that affect overall sleep duration and quality. </br>Sleep Onset REM Period (SOREMP): REM sleep occurring within 15 minutes of sleep onset on a multiple sleep latency test or overnight polysomnogram. </br>Sleep Related Abnormal Sexual Behaviors: Any of a spectrum of sexualized behaviors which arise from sleep, typically NREM sleep. </br>Sleep Related Violence: Violent behavior which is associated with a NREM parasomnia when the affected individual is accidentally provoked by another person in close proximity – usually a family member. </br>Suggested Immobilization Test: A procedure for evaluation of periodic leg movements and related sensory components of RLS during resting wakefulness.</br>A standard polysomnogram recording without respiratory measures is used
