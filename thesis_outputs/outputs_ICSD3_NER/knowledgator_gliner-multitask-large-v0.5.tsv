Introduction	
Classification	CONCEPT
of	CONCEPT
disorders	CONCEPT
plays	
several	
key	
roles	
in	
medicine	
.	
The	
most	
familiar	
of	
these	
is	
that	
is	
serves	
as	
a	
guide	
to	
clinicians	
in	
the	
identification	
of	
specific	
disease	CONDITION
states	CONDITION
.	CONDITION
In	
doing	
so	
,	
classification	CONCEPT
systems	CONCEPT
provide	
clinicians	
with	
important	
informa-	
tion	
regarding	
numerous	
related	
factors	
including	
pathogenesis	
,	
prognosis	RISKFACTOR
,	
course	
,	
and	
heritability	
.	
Moreover	
,	
therapeutic	TREATMENT
interventions	TREATMENT
are	
largely	
guided	
by	
the	
nosologi-	
cal	
decisions	
made	
by	
clinicians	
.	
In	
turn	
,	
information	
accrued	
regarding	
therapeutic	OUTCOME
response	OUTCOME
of	
these	
disease	SYMPTOM
states	SYMPTOM
is	
utilized	
to	
further	
refine	
the	
nosology	
.	
Classification	CONCEPT
systems	CONCEPT
also	
serve	
to	
define	
the	
domain	
of	
a	
given	
discipline	
,	
a	
factor	
of	
particular	
importance	
for	
fields	
such	
as	
sleep	CONCEPT
medicine	CONCEPT
which	
cut	
across	
many	
related	
special-	
ties	
.	
Finally	
,	
by	
identifying	
areas	
of	
uncertainty	
and	
overlap	
among	
related	
patholo-	
gies	
,	
these	
systems	
play	
a	
critical	
role	
in	
guiding	
future	
research	DOCUMENT
agendas	DOCUMENT
which	
will	
enhance	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
clinical	
features	
,	
pathophysiology	
and	
treatment	OUTCOME
response	OUTCOME
specific	
to	
each	
disorder	CONDITION
.	
Since	
its	
infancy	
35	
years	
ago	
,	
the	
field	
of	
sleep	TREATMENT
medicine	TREATMENT
has	
paid	
particular	
atten-	
tion	
to	
the	
issue	
of	
classification	
,	
beginning	
with	
the	
1979	
American	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
Association	DOCUMENT
’s	
Diagnostic	CONCEPT
Classification	CONCEPT

and	CONDITION
Arousal	CONDITION
Disorders	CONDITION
.	
Since	
that	
time	
,	
as	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
sleep	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
has	
grown	
,	
several	
differ-	
ent	
structural	
approaches	
have	
been	
utilized	
in	
revisions	
of	
the	
classification	CONCEPT
system	CONCEPT
,	
culminating	
in	
the	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT

,	DOCUMENT
2nd	DOCUMENT
Edition	DOCUMENT
.	
The	
organization	
of	
that	
edition	
,	
although	
not	
without	
its	
limitations	
,	
has	
proven	
effective	
and	
user	
-	
friendly	
and	
has	
been	
maintained	
in	
the	
current	
revision	
.	
Ideally	
,	
classification	CONCEPT
systems	CONCEPT
are	
based	
largely	
on	
pathophysiology	
.	
However	
,	
such	
an	
approach	
is	
dependent	
on	
adequate	
knowledge	CONCEPT
concerning	
the	
various	
pathophysiol-	
ogies	
of	
disease	
or	
disorder	
within	
a	
given	
discipline	
.	
As	
is	
the	
case	
with	
many	
diag-	DOCUMENT
nostic	DOCUMENT
systems	DOCUMENT
,	
our	
current	
knowledge	CONCEPT
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
many	
sleep	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
is	
inadequate	
.	
As	
a	
result	
,	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	DOCUMENT
Edition	DOCUMENT
,	
not	
unlike	
its	
predecessors	
,	
employs	
a	
hybrid	CONCEPT
approach	CONCEPT
which	
utilizes	
pathophysiology	
,	
where	
known	
,	
but	
also	
relies	
heavily	
on	
phenomenology	CONCEPT
and	
organ	CONCEPT
system	CONCEPT
approaches	CONCEPT
.	
Despite	
these	
shortcomings	
,	
this	
approach	
is	
one	
that	
has	
proven	
familiar	
and	
workable	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
clinicians	
.	
Recognizing	
the	
need	
for	
currency	
and	
relevance	
in	
a	
rapidly	
evolving	
field	
,	
the

Following

a

consisting

individual

group

for	
each	
Introduction	
major	
division	
of	
the	
manual	
,	
was	
selected	
,	
along	
with	
two	
pediatric	
consultants	
.	
A	
focus	
group	
of	
experts	
was	
convened	
in	
June	
2011	
to	
obtain	
input	
on	
major	
structural	
and	
content	
issues	
.	
Based	
on	
this	
feedback	
,	
individual	
work	
groups	
then	
set	
about	
to	
define	
the	
list	
of	
disorders	CONDITION
to	
be	
included	
within	
their	
sections	
as	
well	
as	
proposed	
cri-	
teria	
for	
each	
diagnosis	TEST
.	
This	
process	
included	
comprehensive	
literature	DOCUMENT
searches	
for	
every	
potential	
diagnosis	TEST
as	
well	
as	
for	
their	
major	
features	
.	
The	
draft	DOCUMENT
diagnostic	DOCUMENT
crite-	DOCUMENT
ria	DOCUMENT
which	
emanated	
from	
this	
work	
were	
then	
reviewed	
and	
modified	
by	
the	
task	
force	
(	
consisting	
of	
the	
work	
group	
chairs	
and	
pediatric	
advisors	
)	
,	
as	
well	
as	
by	
the	
board	
of	
the	
AASM	
.	
The	
edited	
criteria	
were	
then	
distributed	
to	
external	
peer	
reviewers	
with	
expertise	
in	
the	
respective	
areas	
,	
as	
well	
as	
to	
international	
societies	
and	
membership	
sections	
of	
the	
AASM	
for	
comment	
.	
These	
reviews	DOCUMENT
were	
carefully	
considered	
and	
revi-	
sions	
made	
based	
on	
this	
input	
.	
Subsequent	
to	
this	
,	
text	
revisions	
were	
begun	
and	
the	
same	
review	
process	
and	
modifications	
were	
undertaken	
once	
text	
drafts	
were	
com-	
pleted	
.	
Further	
modifications	
were	
made	
based	
on	
recommendations	
from	
the	
AASM	DOCUMENT
board	DOCUMENT
before	
finalization	
of	
the	
edition	
.	
At	
all	
points	
in	
this	
process	
,	
efforts	
were	
made	
to	
rely	
as	
heavily	
as	
possible	
on	
available	
and	
current	
scientific	
evidence	
.	
However	
,	
due	
to	
the	
paucity	
of	
available	
evidence	
in	
many	
areas	
,	
decisions	
regarding	
the	
nosol-	
ogy	
were	
often	
made	
by	
consensus	
of	
the	
work	
groups	
,	
task	
force	
,	
and	
reviewers	
.	
Using	
ICSD-3	TEST
As	
noted	
above	
,	
the	
general	
structure	
of	
the	
current	DOCUMENT
edition	DOCUMENT
closely	
parallels	
that	
of	
the	
second	DOCUMENT
edition	DOCUMENT
.	
The	
major	
clinical	CONCEPT
divisions	CONCEPT
remain	
unchanged	
.	
As	
with	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
,	
2nd	
Edition	
,	
pediatric	TEST
diagnoses	TEST
are	
fully

Where	
pediatric	CONCEPT
presentations	CONCEPT
call	
for	
variation	
in	
the	
diagnostic	CONCEPT
criteria	CONCEPT
,	
those	
variations	
are	
noted	
within	
the	
criteria	
section	
.	
In	
an	
effort	
to	
better	
identify	
those	
clinical	
features	
of	
a	
disorder	
which	
are	
developmentally	
-	
specific	
,	
a	
text	
heading	
for	
Developmental	
Issues	
has	
been	
added	
for	
each	
diagnosis	
.	
Specific	
ICD	DOCUMENT
codes	
(	
9	DOCUMENT

CM	DOCUMENT
and	
10	DOCUMENT
-	DOCUMENT
CM	DOCUMENT
)	DOCUMENT
are	
listed	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
each	
diagnosis	
.	
Because	
of	
the	
complexities	
and	
differences	
between	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
diagnoses	
and	
the	
ICD	DOCUMENT
system	
,	
assign-	
ment	
of	
codes	
is	
challenging	
.	
These	
issues	
are	
discussed	
further	
under	
Coding	
below	
.	
Although	
classification	CONCEPT
systems	CONCEPT
are	
,	
by	
their	
nature	
,	
intended	
to	
define	
disorders	CONDITION
in	
the	
most	
specific	
terms	
possible	
,	
clinicians	
must	
recognize	
that	
there	
is	
inevitably	
some	
degree	
of	
variability	
in	
presentation	
which	
may	
result	
in	
clinically	CONDITION
significant	CONDITION
conditions	CONDITION
which	
do	
not	
meet	
all	
specific	
criteria	
for	
a	
given	
diagnosis	
.	
Therefore	
,	
some	
degree	
of	
judgment	
is	
necessary	
in	
the	
application	
of	
these	
criteria	
.	
Bearing	
this	
exception	
in	
mind	
,	
all	
listed	
criteria	
should	
generally	
be	
met	
for	
establishment	
of	
a	
given	
diagnosis	
,	
unless	
otherwise	
specified	
.	
Clinicians	
should	
note	
that	
most	
diagnoses	
within	
the	
International	CONCEPT
Classification	CONCEPT
of	
Sleep	CONDITION
Disorders	CONDITION
include	
a	
criterion	
,	
or	
cri-	
teria	
,	
that	
connote	
clinical	RISKFACTOR
significance	RISKFACTOR
(	
i.e.	
,	
disturbing	SYMPTOM

significant	RISKFACTOR
conse-	RISKFACTOR
quences	RISKFACTOR
,	
distress	
or	
impairment	
in	
one	
or	
more	
functional	
realms	
)	
.	
These	
criteria	
are	
particularly	
important	
because	
,	
without	
them	
,	
many	
phenomena	
related	
to	
sleep	SYMPTOM
-	SYMPTOM
wake	SYMPTOM
do	
not	
rise	
to	
a	
level	
that	
requires	
clinical	
attention	
and

Users	
should	
also	
pay	
particular	
attention	
to	
the	
Notes	DOCUMENT
section	
(	
where	
included	
)	
,	
as	
these	
notes	DOCUMENT
provide	
essential	
definitions	DOCUMENT
and	
details	
concerning	
application	
of	
the	
criteria	
.	
Clinicians	
will	
note	
a	
number	
of	
significant	
content	
changes	
from	
the	
former	
edition	
.	
The	
most	
apparent	
of	
these	
is	
the	
collapse	
of	
all	
previous	
chronic	CONDITION
insomnia	CONDITION
diagnoses	TEST
into	
a	
single	
chronic	CONDITION
insomnia	CONDITION
disorder	
diagnosis	TEST

The	
rationale	
for	
this	
is	
described	
in	
the	
introductory	DOCUMENT
section	DOCUMENT
of	
Insomnia	CONDITION
disorders	
.	
A	
separate	
diagnosis	TEST
is	
retained

This	
modification	
is	
discussed	
in	
the	
introduction

also	
find	
several	
new

a

now	
appears

This	
term	
is	
preferred	
to	
the	
widely	
used	
term	
complex	CONDITION
sleep	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
because	
it	
describes	
a	
more

also

Unfortunately	
,	
these	
competing

have	
differed	
significantly	
in

over	
the	
years

Development	
of	
DSM-5	DOCUMENT
was	
ongoing	
during	
the	
development

this

an	
effort	
was	
undertaken	
to	
achieve	
the	
greatest	
degree	
of	
concordance	
possible	
between	
these	
two	
systems	
,	
recognizing	
that	
the

will	
inevitably	
contain	
a	
greater	
level	
of	
detail	
than

due	
to	
differences	
in	
their

This	
goal	
was	
largely	
achieved	
although	
some	
differences	
will	
still	
exist

a	
major

The

the

promoted	
the	
concept	
that

exist

However

There

recognition	
that	
even	
when

“

another

it

Despite

As	
a

discrimination

proven

the

In

the

inappropriate

Currently	
there	
is	
limited

it

OSA	CONDITION

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
underlying	
upper	SYMPTOM
airway	SYMPTOM
narrowing	SYMPTOM
during	
sleep	
is	
multifactorial	
.	
Patients	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
commonly	
have	
reduced	
cross	
-	
sectional	
area	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
lumen	
due	
to	
either	
excessive	
bulk	
of	
soft	
tissues	
(	
tongue	
,	
soft	
palate	
,	
and	
lateral	
pha-	
ryngeal	
walls	
)	
or	
craniofacial	
anatomy	
,	
or	
both	
.	
During	
inspiration	
,	
negative	
pressure	
is	
generated	
in	
the	
lumen	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
,	
promoting	
closure	
.	
However	
,	
pharyngeal	
dilating	
muscles	
act	
to	
maintain	
patency	
.	
The	
activity	
of	
these	
muscles	
decreases	
with	
sleep	
onset	
,	
but	
is	
normally	
adequate	
to	
maintain	
an	
open	
airway	
.	
In	
persons	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
,	
the	
activity	
of	
the	
pharyngeal	
dilating	
muscles	
becomes	
insufficient	
to	
prevent	
narrow-	
ing	
and/or	
closure	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
.	
This	
state

the	
major	
con-	
tributing	
factor	
leading	
to	
an

Pathophysiology	
In	
children

,	
OSA	CONDITION
results	
from	
a	
combination	
of	
abnormal	
neuromuscular	
control	
and	
anatomical	
narrowing	
of	
the	
collapsible	
(	
supracartilaginous	
)	
portion	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
.	
During	
wakefulness	
,	
the	
patient	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
compensates	
by	
augmenting	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
to	
dilate	
the	
upper	
airway	
;	
thus	
,	
obstructive	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
does	
not	
occur

is	
a

during

periodic

be	
a	
product	
of	
the	
hyperventilation	SYMPTOM
induced	
by	
the	
hypobaric	CONDITION
hypoxia	CONDITION
encountered	
at	
altitude	
.	
At	
2,500

the	
atmo-	
spheric	
pressure	
is	
approximately	
570	
mm

and	
the

alveolar	TEST
PO2	TEST
around	
55

(	
depending

)	
.	
Actual	
arterial	TEST
PO2	TEST
values	
will	
be	
lower	
,	
especially	
during

The	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
shows	
a	
steep	
increase	
in	
ventilation	
when	
the	
arterial	TEST
PO2	TEST
level	
drops	
below	
55	
mm

.	
The	
increases	
in	
venti-	
lation	
associated	
with	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
result	
in	
hypocapnic	CONDITION
alkalosis	CONDITION
.	
Because	
PaCO2	TEST
is	
the	
principal	
stimulus	
to	
respiration	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
a	
low	
PaCO2	TEST
can	
yield	
a	
loss	
or	
reduction	
in	
respiratory	
drive	
,	
resulting	
in	
central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
or	
hypopnea	CONDITION
.	
The	
greater	
the	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
hypoxia	CONDITION
,	
the	
greater	
the	
fall	
in	
PaCO2	TEST
.	
Thus	
,	
individuals	
with	
brisk	
hypoxic	
responses	
more	
commonly	
tend	
to	
demonstrate	
this	
respiratory	
pattern	
.	
Over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
apnea	CONDITION
,	
the	
PaO2	TEST
falls	
and	
PaCO2	TEST
rises	
,	
eventually	
stimulating	
a	
resumption	
of	
ventilation	
.	
However	
,	
after	
several	
large	
breaths	
,	
the	
PaCO2	TEST
again	
falls	
below	
the	
apnea	CONDITION
threshold	
,	
initiating	
another	
pause	
in	
breathing	
.	
This	
cycle	
is	
then	
repeated	
over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
night	
.	
Of	
note	
,	
the	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
often	
improved	
during	
REM	
sleep	
with	
reduced	
cycling	
.	
This	
is	
likely	
due	
to	
the	
decreased	
hypoxic	CONDITION

hypercapnic	CONDITION
responsiveness	
characteristic	
of	
REM	
sleep	
.	
Of	
interest

ventilatory	
response	
continued	
to	
increase	
up

some

with	
adaptation	
to

despite	
a

may	
be	
due

The

generally	
8

In	
one

the

around	
8

The

This	
breathing	
pattern	
occurs	
only	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
with	
more	
rhythmic	
respiration	
during	
REM

.	
Because	
this	
breathing	
pattern	
is	
a	
physiologic	
adaptation	
to

,	
there	
is	
no	
specific	
number	
of	
apneas	CONDITION
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
that	
is	
considered	
normal	
or	
abnormal	
.	
The	
apneas	CONDITION
and	
associated	
hyperpnea	SYMPTOM
can	
lead	
to	
recurrent	
arousals	
from	
sleep	
,	
which	
often	
increase

The

Pathophysiology	
The	
etiology	CONCEPT
of	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
is	
not	
completely	
understood	
.	
Although	
comorbid	
OSA	CONDITION
is	
common	
,	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
and	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
are	
not

The	
importance	
of	
various	
factors	
leading	
to	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
likely	
varies	
among	
patients	
.	
It	
has	
been	
postulated	
that	
sustained	
nocturnal	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
results	
from	
the	
development	
of	
short

i.e.

periods	
of	
ventilation

obstructive	
events	
.	
Abnormal	
venti-	
latory	
control	
(	
blunted	
hypercapnic	SYMPTOM
ventilatory	
response	
)	
allows	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
to	
persist	
into	
wakefulness	
after	
the	
cause	
of	
acute	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
is	
no	
longer	
present	
.	
A	
chronic	
hypercapnic	SYMPTOM
state	
would	
produce	
an	
elevation	
of	
bicarbonate

Although	
this	
blunts	
the	
degree	
of

hypoventilation	CONDITION
syndrome	CONDITION
(	
CCHS	
)	
is	
a	
syndrome	
of	
auto-	
nomic	
dysfunction	
,	
primarily	
the	
failure	
of	
automatic	
central	
control	
of

,	
due	
to	
a	
mutation

CCHS	
is	
characterized	
by	
the

,	
usually	
at

Clinical

Research	
suggests	
that	
severity	
of

is	
related	
to	
the	
type

Most	
patients	
have	
a	
polyalanine

those	
with	
more	
polyalanine

are	
more	
likely	
to	
have	
severe	CONDITION
disease	CONDITION
including	
waking	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM

Patients

at

In

due

there	
is	
a	
disproportionate	
ventilatory

are

Finally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM

Daytime	CONDITION
sleepiness	CONDITION

rather

a

low

inappropriate

The

not	
intended	
to	
imply	
that

Most	
patients	
awaken	
refreshed	
after	
a	
sleep	
episode	
but	
begin	
to	
feel	
sleepy	
again	
after	
variable	
times	
.	
Sleepiness	SYMPTOM
is	
most	
likely	
to	
occur	
in	
monotonous	
situations	
that	
require	
no	
active	
participation	
;	
for	
example	
,	
watching	
television	
or	
riding	
in	
a	
car	
.	
Physical	
activity	
may	
temporarily	
suppress	
the	
urge	
to	
sleep	
.	
In	
some	
cases	
sleepiness	
manifests	
as	
sudden	
irresistible	
sleep	
“	
attacks	
”	
that	
may	
occur	
in	
unusual	
situations	
such	
as	
eating

walking	
.	
Often	
,	
such	
sleep	SYMPTOM
attacks	SYMPTOM
occur	
on	
a	
background	
of	
overall	
sleepiness	
.	
Even	
when	
seemingly	
awake	
,	
many	
nar-	CONDITION
colepsy	CONDITION
patients	
have	
lapses	
in	
vigilance	
,	
sometimes	
in	
combination	
with	
automatic	
behavior	
,	
such	
as	
writing	
gibberish	
or	
interrupting	
a	
conversation	
with	
a	
completely	
different	
topic	
.	
Sleepiness	SYMPTOM
generally	
has	
a	
serious	
impact	
on	
the	
ability	
of	
the	
patient	
to	
function	
in	
educational	
,	
social	
,	
and	
occupational	
situations	
.	
Because	
patients	
are	
rarely	
examined	
during	
an	
attack	
of	
cataplexy	CONDITION
,	
its	
presence	
needs	
to	
be	
established	
based	
on	
the	
clinical	TEST
interview	TEST
alone	
.	
Cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
defined	
as	
more	
than	
one	
episode	
of	
generally	
brief	
(	
<	
2	
minutes	
)	
,	
usually	
bilaterally	
symmetrical	
sudden	
loss	
of	
muscle	
tone	
with	
retained	
consciousness	
.	
The	
episodes	
are	
precipitated	
by	
strong	
emotions

usually	
positive

with	
almost	
all

appropriate	
contexts

when	
trying	
to	
elicit	
a

cataplexy	CONDITION
in

The

differs	
widely	
between	
patients	
,	
ranging	
from	
sporadic	
partial	
attacks	
triggered	
by	
laughter

to	
frequent	
complete	
attacks	
of

brought	
about	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
emotions

In	
the	
vast	
majority	
of	
attacks	
,	
cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
bilateral	
,	
although	
patients	
sometimes	
report	
one	
side	
of	
the	
body	
to	
be	
more	
affected	
than	
the	
other	
.	
Partial	
attacks	
can	
be	
very	
subtle	
and	
sometimes	
only	
recognized	
by	
experi-	
enced	
observers	
such	
as	
the

Neck	SYMPTOM

whereas	
facial	SYMPTOM
weakness	SYMPTOM
may	
lead	
to	
sagging

the

Respiratory	
muscles	
are

although

start

over

Although

lead	
to	
cataplexy	SYMPTOM
,	
those	
associated	
with

the

Laughing	
out

telling

a

are	
typical	
examples

The

is	
variable

ranging	
from

The

Pathology

Pathophysiology	
It	
is	
now	
firmly	
established	
that	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
1	CONDITION
is	
caused	
by	
deficiencies	
in	
hypo-	
cretin	
signaling	
,	
most	
likely	
due	
to	
a	
selective	
loss	
of	
hypothalamic	
hypocretin	
pro-	
ducing	
neurons

animal	
models

The

patients	
(

The	
strong	
HLA

has	
led	
to	
the	
hypothesis	CONCEPT
that	
auto-	
immunity	
is	
a	
likely	
etiological	
mechanism	
,	
potentially	
explaining	
the	
selectivity

neuronal

However

underscoring	
the	
importance

It	
is	
strongly	
recommended	
that	
the

by	
at

one

Recent

suggest	
that	
a	
SOREMP	TREATMENT
within	
15	
minutes

is	
a	
highly	
specific	
finding

but	
with	
low

Therefore	
,	
the

allow	
the	
“

IH	CONDITION

,	
the	
pathophysiology

currently

However

that

based	
on	
the	
length

lacks

The

If

mean

latencies	
are	
not	
used	
as	
a	
diagnostic	
criterion	
,	
the	
distribution	
of	
latencies	
is	
unimodal	
,	
suggesting	
no	
sepa-	
rate	
subtypes	
.	
In	
addition	
,	
an	
actigraphy	TEST
study	
has	
shown	
that	
patients	
with	
IH	CONDITION
tend	
to	
overestimate	
their	
sleep	
time	
by	
a	
mean	
of	
0.99	
hours	
,	
thus	
making	
the	
fundamental	
criterion	
for	
distinguishing	
between	
patients	
with	
long	
and	
shorter	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
inaccurate	
.	
Clinicians	
may	
wish	
to	
continue	
to	
note	
sleep	
duration	
as	
an	
important	
clinical	
feature	
,	
but	
the	
caveats	
discussed

should	
be	
clearly	
considered

Any	
future	
separation

Developmental	
Issues	
ASWPD	CONDITION
is	
most	
frequently	
encountered	
among	
older	
age	
groups	
.	
An	
early	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
ASWPD	CONDITION
should	
prompt	
further	
probing	
for	
a	
familial	CONCEPT
pattern	CONCEPT
.	CONCEPT
Caregivers	
may	
report	
that	
a	
child	
wakes	
“	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
morning	
,	
which	
is	
disruptive	
to	
the	
house-	
hold	
routine	
and	
may	
curtail	
parental	
sleep	
.	
This	
is	
particularly	
true	
for	
younger	
chil-	
dren	
,	
who	
may	
require	
adult	
supervision	
once	
they	
are	
awake	
.	
However	
,	
this	
complaint	SYMPTOM
regarding	
the	
waking	SYMPTOM
pattern	SYMPTOM
is	
often	
more	
related	
to	
unrealistic	
caregiver	
expecta-

an	
“

,	
rather	
than	
to	
a	
true	
advance	
in	
sleep	
onset	
and	
offset	
.	
In	
some	
cases	
,	
children	
are	
motivated	
to	
wake	
up	
earlier	
than	
desired	
because	
they	
are	
reinforced	
for	
this	
behavior	
by	
parental	
attention	
or	
the	
opportunity	
to	
watch	
television	
or	
utilize	
other	
media	
upon	
waking	
.	
The	
com-	
plaint	
that	
a	
child	
“	
falls	
asleep	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
evening	
,	
especially	
in	
adolescence	
,	
is	
rare	
and	
should	
raise	
concerns

the	
possibility	
of	
chronically	SYMPTOM
insufficient	SYMPTOM

and/or	
a

The	
rarity	
of	
observa-	
tions	
of	
advanced	
sleep	
onset	
and	
offset	
times	
among	
young	
children	
may	
also	
be	
due	
in	
part	
to	
societal	
expectations	
of	
earlier	
bed	
and	
wake	
times	
for	
this	
age	
group

a	
misalignment

(

an

and	
Complications	
The

closely

to	
work	
schedules	
and	
typically	
remits	
when	
the	
major	
sleep	
episode	
is	
scheduled	
at	
a	
conventional	
time	
.	
Because	
there	
are	
so	
many	
different	
work	
schedules

ranging	
from	
an	
occasional	
overnight	
shift	
to	
regular	
night	
work	
,	
the	
course	
is	
quite	
variable

Because	
shift	
work	
is	
often	
combined

fatigue	SYMPTOM
can	
be	
a

often	
counteracted	
by

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
condition	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
directly	
related	
to	
circadian	CONCEPT
misalignment	CONCEPT
and	
sleep	SYMPTOM
loss	SYMPTOM
.	
The	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
is	
generated	
by	
a	
circadian	CONCEPT
alerting	CONCEPT
process	CONCEPT
that	
corre-	
sponds	
with	
the	
time	
that	
the	
worker	
needs	
to	
sleep	
.	
The	
excessive	SYMPTOM
sleepiness	SYMPTOM
during	
the	
night	
and	
early	
morning	
appears	
to	
be	
partly	
related	
to	
cumulative	
sleep	SYMPTOM
loss	SYMPTOM
and	
partly	
due	
to	
a	
decreased	
circadian	CONCEPT
alerting	CONCEPT
signal	CONCEPT
that	
corresponds	
with	
the	
work	
time	
and	
the	
commute	
to	
and	
from	
work

Tolerance	
to	
night

varies	
considerably

may	
involve	
differences

to	
a

Alternatively

may	
last	
as	
long	
as	
30

40	
minutes

Sleep	
talking

shouting	
may	
accompany	
these	
events

The	
eyes	
are	
usually	
open

are	
wide

This

Childhood	
sleepwalking	
usually	
disappears

occur

The

be	
insidious

sporadic

it	
can	
be	
precipitous

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
SRED	CONDITION
is	
unclear	
.	
Despite	
the	
broad	
range	
of	
pre-	
disposing	
and	
precipitating	RISKFACTOR
factors	RISKFACTOR
in	
SRED	TEST
,	
the	
relatively	
homogeneous	
set	
of	
clinical	
features	
suggests	
the	
presence	
of	
a	
“	
final	CONCEPT
common	CONCEPT
pathway	CONCEPT
”	
that	
can	
be	
accessed	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
factors	
.	
Although	
SRED	TEST
has	
prominent	
features	
of	
both	
a	
sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
and	
an	
eating	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
,	
its	
relatively	
homogeneous	
presentation	
supports	
its	
classification	
as	
a	
separate	
diagnostic	
entity	
.	
More	
than	
half	
of	
patients	
with	
SRED	CONDITION
have	
a	
history	
of	
another	
parasomnia	CONDITION
that	
preceded	
the	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
eating	
,	
suggesting	
that	
the	
presence	
of	
another	
parasomnia	CONDITION
is	
a	
major	
risk	RISKFACTOR
factor	RISKFACTOR
for	
SRED	CONDITION
.	
However	
,	
the	
female	CONCEPT
predominance	CONCEPT
in	
SRED	CONDITION
is	
more	
consistent	
with	
eating	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
,	
which	
are	
female	
pre-	
dominant	
,	
than	
with	
sleepwalking	SYMPTOM
or	
movement	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
(	
RLS	CONDITION
/	
PLMD	CONDITION
)	
which	
have	
slight	
to	
no	
female	
bias	
.	
Thus	
it	
appears	
that	
two	
basic	
drive	
states	
—	
sleeping	
and	
eating	
—	
are	
pathologically	
intertwined	
in	
SRED	CONDITION

Although

The	
level

consciousness	
has	
typically	
spanned	
the	
range	
from	
virtual	
unconsciousness	
to	
various	
levels

partial	
consciousness

a

This	
dissociation	CONDITION

can	
be

In	
contrast

classic

usually	
associated	
with	
the	
persistence

that

In

This

Developmental	
Issues	
The	
accurate	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	SYMPTOM
in	
children	
and	
adolescents	
requires	
understanding	
of	
developmental	CONCEPT
language	CONCEPT
and	
cognitive	CONCEPT
skills	CONCEPT
.	CONCEPT
Adequate	
verbal	CONCEPT
skills	CONCEPT
are	
needed	
for	
children	
to	
communicate	
the	
sensory	
component	
of	
RLS	SYMPTOM
and	
description	
must	
be	
in	
“	
the	
child	
’s	
own	
words	
,	
”	
rather	
than	
by	
a	
parent	
or	
caretaker	
.	
For	
criterion	
A	
,	
children	
rarely	
use	
or	
understand	
the	
word	
“	
urge	
.	
”	
Instead	
they	
describe	
that	
their	
legs	
“	
need	
to	
”	
“	
have	
to	
”	
or	
“	
got	
to	
”	
move	
.	
Descriptors	
for	
the	
discomfort	
include	
:	
bugs	SYMPTOM

ants	SYMPTOM
,	
weird/	SYMPTOM
funny	SYMPTOM
feelings	SYMPTOM
,	
tingle	SYMPTOM
,	
wiggly	SYMPTOM
,	
and	
shaky	SYMPTOM
.	
Younger	
children	
often	
use	
the	
word	
“	
kick	
”	
rather	
than	
“	
move	
,	
”	
e.g.	
,	
“	
my	
legs	
want	
to	
kick	
.	
”	
Similar	
to

children	
report

almost	
half

Sitting

lying	
in

,	
reading	
a	
book

situations

children	
report	
onset

their

Relief	
is	
typically	
achieved	
by	
moving	
around	
,	
walking	
,	
rubbing	
,	
kicking

distraction

Perhaps	
as	
a

two

the

Similarly

the

not

Studies	DOCUMENT

shown	
that

most	
cases	
the	
cause

the	
accompanying

something

periodic

repetitive

not	
be

sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
or	
other	
etiology	
.	
PLMS	
occur	
most	
frequently	
in	
the	
lower	
extremities

They	
typically	
involve	
exten-	
sion	
of	
the	
big	
toe

often	
in	
combination	
with	
partial	
flexion	
of	
the	
ankle	
,	
the	
knee	
,	
and	
sometimes	
,	
the	
hip	
.	
Similar	
movements	
can	
occur	
in	
the	
upper	
limbs

Individual	
movements

associated

an	
autonomic	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION

or	
an

the	
patient	
is	
unaware

the	
limb	
movements

An	
arousal	
may	
precede

that

RMD	CONDITION
comprises	
several	
sub-	
types

Body	SYMPTOM
rocking	SYMPTOM
may	
involve	
the	
entire	
body	
,	
with	
the	
individual	
on	
hands	
and	
knees	
,	
or	
it	
may	
be	
limited	
to	
the	
torso	
,	
with	
the	
individual	
sitting	
.	
Head	SYMPTOM
banging	SYMPTOM
often	
occurs	
with	
the	
person	
prone	
,	
repeatedly	
lifting	
the	
head	
or	
entire	
upper	
torso	
,	
and	
forc-	
ibly	
banging	
the	
head	
back	
down	
into	
the	
pillow	
or	
mattress	
.	
Alternately	
,	
the	
individual	
may	
sit	
with	
the	
back	
of	
the	
head	
against	
the	
headboard	
or	
wall	
,	
repeatedly	
banging	
the	
occiput	
.	
Combining	
head	
banging	
and	
body	
rocking	
,	
they	
may	
rock	
on	
hands

,	
banging	
the	
vertex	
or	
frontal	
region	
of	
the	
head	
into	
the	
headboard

although	
they	
also	
may	
occur	
at	
any	
time	
during	
the	
night

even	
during	
quiet	
wakeful	
activities	
,	
such	
as	
listening	
to	
music	
or	
trav-	
eling	
in	
vehicles

The	
movement	
frequency	
can	
vary	
,	
but	
the	
rate	
is	
usually	
between	
0.5	
per	
second	
and	
two	
per

Duration	
of	
the	
individual	
movement	
clusters	
also	
varies

generally	
is	
less

Essential	
Features	
Propriospinal	SYMPTOM
myoclonus	SYMPTOM
at	
sleep	
onset	
(	
PSM	
)	
consists	
of	
sudden	
myoclonic	SYMPTOM
jerks	SYMPTOM
occurring	
in	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
and	
,	
rarely	
,	
during	
intrasleep	
wakefulness	
and	
upon	
awakening	
in	
the	
morning	
.	
The	
jerks	
arise	
mainly	
in	
the	
axial	
muscles	
and	
spread	
rostrally	
and	
caudally	
according	
to	
propriospinal	CONCEPT
propagation	CONCEPT
.	
The	
jerks	SYMPTOM
may	
be	
of	
variable	
intensity	
;	
they	
are	
isolated	
,	
recurring	
in	
quasi	
-	
periodic	
fashion	
for	
variable	
durations	
,	
or	
may	
be	
repeated	
in	
brief	
clusters	
of	
a	
few	
movements	
,	
sepa-	
rated	
by	
longer	
intervals	
.	
Jerks	SYMPTOM
involve	
the	
abdominal	
and	
truncal	
muscles	
first	
and	
are	
then	
propagated	
to	
proximal	
muscles	
of	
the	
limbs	
and	
the	
neck	
.	
The	
pattern	
of	
move-	
ment	
is	
usually	
flexor	
but	
may	
be	
an	
extension	
of	
the	
trunk	
.	
Vocalization	
rarely	
occurs	
.	
The	
jerks	SYMPTOM
are	
most	
often	
spontaneous	
but	
,	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
can	
be	
evoked	
by	
external	TREATMENT
stimulations	TREATMENT
.	
The	
jerks	SYMPTOM
appear	
to	
be

Any	
mental	
acti-	
vation	
makes	
the	
jerks	SYMPTOM
disappear

The	
jerks	SYMPTOM
eventually	
disappear	
at

and	
remain	
absent	
throughout	
all	
stages	
of

Polysomnography	TEST

The

The

that

in	
7.5	
%	
of

a	
polysomnogram	TEST
was	
performed

It

the

be	
increased

it

occur

The

the

the	
general	
population

its	
frequency

affected	
individuals	
remains	
uncertain

The

Patients

Therefore

the	
age

of	
both

are	
similar

with	
both	
males

mostly	
unilateral	
rather

alternating	
,

often	
show	
sequences	
that	
last	
longer	
than	
those	
reported

The	
reported	
HFLM	SYMPTOM
may	
be	
more	
common	
than	
ALMA	TEST

and	
the	
possibility	
exists	
that	
ALMA	TEST
rep-	
resents	
a	
subtype	
of	
HFLM	SYMPTOM
in	
which	
leg	
alternation	
occurs	
.	
The	
degree	
to	
which	
these	
movements	
are	
quasi	
-	
voluntary	
remains	
to	
be	
determined	
because	
some	
are	
suppressible	
.	
Whether	
HFT	TEST
and	
ALMA	TEST
are	
merely	
alternate	
forms	
of	
the	
same	
underlying	
motor	
mechanism	
is	
also	
unclear

reports

nothing	
is	
known	
about	
their

in	
the

The	
associations	
noted	
may	
be	
due	
to	
biased	
sampling	
caused	
by	
a	
skewing

The

2nd	
Edition	
included	
a	
specific	
diagnosis	
of	
environmental	CONDITION
sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
within	
this	
section	
.	
This	
diagnosis	
is	
infre-	
quently	
employed	
in	
the	
clinical	
setting	
and	
significant	
controversy	
exists	
regarding	
whether	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
represents	
a	
clinical	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
per	
se	
.	
The	
condition	
is	
typically	
characterized	
by	
complaints	
of	
sleep	
initiation	
and/or	
maintenance	
that	
are	
the	
direct	
result	
of	
an	
environmental	RISKFACTOR
factor	RISKFACTOR

Associated	
daytime	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
such	
as	
sleepiness	SYMPTOM
,	
fatigue	SYMPTOM
,	
or	
cognitive	SYMPTOM
or	
emotional	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
may	
be	
present	
.	
The	
environmental	
disturbance	
may	
be	
a	
physical	
stimulus	
such	
as	
noise	
(	
e.g.	
,	
vehicular	
traffic	
,	
aircraft	
,	
bed	
partner	
snoring	SYMPTOM
)	
,	
light	
,	
temperature	
,	
movement	
(	
e.g.	
,	
bed

or	
parasomnia	CONDITION
)	
,	
an	
emotional	
stimulus	
such	
as	
environ-	CONCEPT
mental	CONCEPT
danger	CONCEPT
(	
e.g.	
,	
combat	
setting	
or	
disaster	
area	
)	
,	
or	
an	
environmental	
requirement	
(	
such	
as	
caring	
for	
an	
infant	
or	
elderly	
family	
member	
)	
.	
Hospitalization	TREATMENT
is	
often	
cited	
as	
a	
precipitant	
of	
environmental	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
although	
many	
additional	
factors	
(	
e.g.	
,	
anxiety	SYMPTOM
or	
pain	SYMPTOM
)	
may	
also	
contribute	
to	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
in	
this	
setting	
.	
If	
the	
clinician	
determines	
that	
an	
environmental	RISKFACTOR
factor	RISKFACTOR
is	
the	
primary	
cause	
of	
a	
sleep	
distur-	
bance	
,	
a	
diagnosis	TEST
of	
Other	CONDITION
Sleep	CONDITION
Disorder	CONDITION
may	
be	
employed	
.	
It	
is	
the	
physical	CONCEPT
aspects	CONCEPT
of	
the	
environment	
,	
rather	
than	
their	
psychological	CONCEPT
meaning	CONCEPT
,	
which	
account	
for	
the	
sleep	SYMPTOM
complaint	SYMPTOM
.	
Unlike	
insomnia	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
,	
the	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
is	
dependent	
on	
the	
presence	
of	
the	
environmental	RISKFACTOR
factor	RISKFACTOR
.	
In	
the	
absence	
of	
the	
stimu-	
lus	
,	
sleep	
is	
normal	
.	
The	
prevalence	
of	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbances	SYMPTOM
is	
not	
known	
although	
,	
as	
noted	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
is	
not	
commonly	
reported	
in	
sleep	
centers	
.	
Some	
individuals	
Other	
Sleep	CONDITION
Disorder	CONDITION
may	
be	
more	
susceptible	
to	
environmental	RISKFACTOR
disturbances	RISKFACTOR
but	
little	
is	
known	
about	
spe-	
cific	
characteristics	
that	
might	
predispose	
to	
this	
condition	
.	
Although	
environmental	RISKFACTOR
factors	RISKFACTOR
may	
play	
a	
contributing	
role	
in	
some	
cases	
of	
chronic	CONDITION
insomnia	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
,	
multiple	
other	
factors	
account	
for	
that	
condition	
,	
which	
is	
typically	
evident	
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
the	
offending	
environmental	
stimulus	
.	
Distinguishing	
an	
insomnia	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
from	
an	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
may	
pose	
a	
challenge	
in	
certain	
clinical	
encounters	
and	
providers	
must	
use	
clinical	
judgment	
in	
establishing	
the	
diagnosis	
.	
In	
behavioral	CONDITION

the

An

is	
the

which

the

Pathophysiology	
of	
sleep

GER	
is	
similar	
to	
diurnal	SYMPTOM
GER	SYMPTOM
(	
i.e.	
,	
transient	
LES	
relaxations	
and	
a	
low

However	
,	
sleep	
impacts	
esophageal	
physiology	
through	
the	
impairment	
of	
esophageal	
acid	
clearance	
mechanisms	
when	
GER	SYMPTOM
events	
occur	
.	
With	
sleep	
onset	
,	
the	
upper	
esophageal	
sphincter	
(	
UES	
)	
pressure	
decreases

is	
lowest
