The

are				
characterized				
by				
abnormalities				
of				
respi-				
ration				
during				
sleep

In				
some				
of				
these				
disorders				
,				
respiration				
is				
also				
abnormal				
during				
wakefulness

Excessive	symptom	b		
sleepiness	symptom	i		
is				
a				
major				
presenting				
complaint				
in				
many				
but				
not				
all				
cases				
.				
				
The				
sleepiness				
is				
most				
evident				
during				
relaxing				
or				
inactive				
situations				
.				
				
With				
extreme				
sleepi-				
ness				
,				
sleep				
may				
occur				
while				
actively				
conversing				
,				
eating				
,				
walking				
,				
or				
driving				
.				
				
In				
women				
,				
excessive	symptom	b		
sleepiness	symptom	i		
is				
a				
less				
prominent				
complaint				
.				
				
Additionally				
,				
reports				
of				
insomnia	symptom	b		
,				
poor	symptom	b		
sleep	symptom	i		
quality	symptom	i		
,				
and				
fatigue	symptom	b		
are				
common				
,				
particularly				
among				
women				
.				
				
Quality				
of				
life				
generally				
is				
adversely				
affected				
by				
unrefreshing	symptom	b		
sleep	symptom	i		
,				
sleepiness	symptom	b		
,				
and				
fatigue	symptom	b		
.				
				
Bed				
part-				
ners				
may				
also				
report				
sleep				
disruption				
and				
associated				
consequences				
.				
				
The				
frequency				
of				
apneas	concept	b		
and				
hypopneas	concept	b		
during				
sleep				
correlates				
poorly				
with				
daytime				
symptom				
severity				
and				
impact				
on				
quality				
of				
life				
.				
				
In				
some				
cases				
,				
affected				
individuals				
will				
not				
endorse				
any				
symptoms				
or				
confirm				
any				
bed				
partner				
observations				
.				
				
Predisposing				
and				
Precipitating				
Factors				
				
The				
major				
predisposing				
factor				
for				
OSA	condition	b		
is				
excess	riskfactor	b		
body	riskfactor	i		
weight	riskfactor	i		
.				
				
It				
has				
been				
estimated				
that				
~60				
%				
of				
moderate				
to				
severe				
OSA	condition	b		
is				
attributable				
to				
obesity	riskfactor	b		
.				
				
The				
risk				
of				
OSA	condition	b		
increases				
as				
the				
degree				
of				
additional				
weight				
increases				
,				
with				
an				
extremely				
high				
preva-				
lence				
of				
OSA	condition	b		
in				
people				
with				
morbid	riskfactor	b		
obesity	riskfactor	i		
.				
				
OSA	condition	b		
patients				
with				
normal				
or				
below				
-				
nor-				
mal				
body				
weight				
are				
more				
likely				
to				
have				
upper	concept	b		
airway	concept	i		
obstruction	concept	i		
due				
to				
a				
localized	concept	b		
structural	concept	i		
abnormality	concept	i		
such				
as				
a				
maxillomandibular	concept	b		
malformation	concept	i		
or				
adenotonsillar	concept	b		
enlargement	concept	i		
.				
				
Increasing	riskfactor	b		
neck	riskfactor	i		
circumference	riskfactor	i		
predicts				
higher				
AHIs	concept	b		
;				
it				
is				
not				
,				
however				
,				
independent				
of				
BMI	concept	b		
.				
				
Instability	riskfactor	b		
in	riskfactor	i		
ventilatory	riskfactor	i		
control				
appears				
to				
increase				
risk				
of				
OSA				
.				
				
Those				
patients				
with				
an				
exaggerated	riskfactor	b		
ventilatory	riskfactor	i		
response	riskfactor	i		
to	riskfactor	i		
a	riskfactor	i		
respiratory	riskfactor	i		
disturbance	riskfactor	i		
have				
a				
greater				
propensity				
for				
obstructive				
events				
.				
				
Menopause	riskfactor	b		
is				
a				
risk				
factor				
for				
this				
disorder				
in				
women				
,				
even				
after				
adjustment				
for				
age				
and				
BMI	concept	b		
.				
				
However				
,				
use				
of				
hormone	treatment	b		
replacement	treatment	i		
therapy	treatment	i		
may				
be				
protective				
.				
				
There				
are				
conflicting				
data				
concerning				
smoking	riskfactor	b		
as				
a				
risk				
factor				
for				
OSA				
.				
				
Various				
abnormalities	riskfactor	b		
of	riskfactor	i		
the	riskfactor	i		
bony	riskfactor	i		
and	riskfactor	i		
soft	riskfactor	i		
tissue	riskfactor	i		
structures	riskfactor	i		
of	riskfactor	i		
the	riskfactor	i		
head	riskfactor	i		
and	riskfactor	i		
neck	riskfactor	i		
may				
predispose				
the				
individual				
to				
having				
OSA	condition	b		
.				
				
These				
may				
be				
hereditary				
(				
e.g.				
,				
mandibular	riskfactor	b		
size	riskfactor	i		
,				
mandibular	riskfactor	b		
position	riskfactor	i		
,				
palatal	riskfactor	b		
height	riskfactor	i		
)				
or				
acquired				
(				
e.g.				
,				
enlarged	riskfactor	b		
adenoids	riskfactor	i		
and	riskfactor	i		
tonsils	riskfactor	i		
)				
.				
				
Endocrine				
disorders				
such				
as				
acromegaly	riskfactor	b		
and				
hypothy-	riskfactor	b		
roidism	riskfactor	i		
are				
risk				
factors				
for				
OSA	condition	b		
.				
				
Adults				
and				
children				
with				
Down	riskfactor	b		
syndrome	riskfactor	i		
also				
have				
a				
high				
prevalence				
of				
OSA	condition	b		
.				
				
OSA	condition	b		
is				
common				
in				
patients				
with				
some				
neurologic	riskfactor	b		
disorders	riskfactor	i		
that	riskfactor	i		
affect	riskfactor	i		
peripheral	riskfactor	i		
muscles	riskfactor	i		
,				
such				
as				
myotonic	riskfactor	b		
dystrophy	riskfactor	i		
.				
				
OSA	condition	b		
is				
likely				
made				
worse				
following				
alcohol	riskfactor	b		
consumption	riskfactor	i		
or				
use				
of				
sedating	riskfactor	b		
medications	riskfactor	i		
before	riskfactor	i

and				
by				
nocturnal	riskfactor	b

This

A				
high	riskfactor	b		
ventilatory	riskfactor	i		
response	riskfactor	i		
to	riskfactor	i		
CO2	riskfactor	i		
seems				
to				
be				
a				
major				
predisposing				
factor				
in				
the				
development				
of				
primary	condition	b		
CSA	condition	i

This				
can

venti-	concept	b	something	
latory	concept	i	something

that				
characterizes				
the				
disorder				
.				
				
Frequent	riskfactor	b		
arousal	riskfactor	i		
from	riskfactor	i		
sleep	riskfactor	i		
can				
also				
predispose				
to				
the				
development				
of				
central	concept	b		
apneas	concept	i		
,				
as				
ventilatory	concept	b		
control	concept	i		
is				
somewhat				
unstable				
at				
sleep				
-				
wake				
transitions				
.				
				
Increased				
ventilation				
associated				
with				
arousal				
can				
result				
in				
a				
PaCO2	concept	b		
below				
the				
HAT	concept	b		
after				
the				
return				
to				
sleep				
.				
				
Because				
ventilatory	concept	b		
drive	concept	i		
is				
lower				
during				
REM	concept	b		
than				
NREM	concept	b		
sleep	concept	i		
,				
hypocapnic	condition	b		
central	condition	i		
apnea	condition	i		
is				
much				
less				
common

Two				
other				
variables				
have				
been				
discussed				
as				
possible				
predispos-				
ing				
factors				
,				
although				
their				
true				
role				
in				
the				
development				
of				
this				
syndrome				
is				
uncertain				
.				
				
First

frequent				
arousal

due				
to				
low	concept	b		
arousal	concept	i		
threshold	concept	i		
or				
sleep	condition	b		
maintenance	condition	i		
insomnia	condition	i		
have				
been				
reported				
to				
lead				
to				
an				
increase				
in				
central	concept	b		
apneas	concept	i		
.				
				
Because				
ventila-	concept	b

be				
somewhat

in

any

suggested				
a				
worsening				
of

A

have				
been				
hypothesized				
to				
cause

,				
but				
definitive				
data				
are				
not
