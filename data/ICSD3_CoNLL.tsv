The

are	
characterized	
by	
abnormalities

of	
these	
disorders	
,	
respiration

also	
abnormal

,	
apneic	B-CONCEPT
and	I-CONCEPT
hypopneic	I-CONCEPT
events	I-CONCEPT
last	
a	
minimum	
of	
10	
seconds

Most	
events	
are	
10	
to	
30	
seconds	
in	
duration	
but	
occasionally	
persist	
for	
one	
minute	
or	
longer	
.	
	
Events	
can	
occur	
in	
any	
stage	B-CONCEPT
of	I-CONCEPT
sleep	I-CONCEPT

more	
frequently	
occur	
in	
stages

N2	B-CONCEPT
,	
and	
R	B-CONCEPT
sleep	I-CONCEPT
than	
in

Events	
are	
usually	
longer	
and	
associated	
with

when	
they	
occur	
in

Snoring	B-SYMPTOM
between	
apneas	B-CONCEPT
is	
typically	
reported	
by	
bed	
partners	
,	
as	
are	
wit-

episodes	
of	
gasping	B-SYMPTOM
or	
choking	B-SYMPTOM
and	
body	B-SYMPTOM

Excessive	B-SYMPTOM
sleepiness	I-SYMPTOM
is	
a	
major	
presenting	
complaint	
in	
many	
but	
not	
all	
cases	
.	
	
The	
sleepiness	
is	
most	
evident	
during	
relaxing	
or	
inactive	
situations	
.	
	
With	
extreme	
sleepi-	
ness	
,	
sleep	
may	
occur	
while	
actively	
conversing	
,	
eating	
,	
walking	
,	
or	
driving	
.	
	
In	
women	
,	
excessive	B-SYMPTOM
sleepiness	I-SYMPTOM
is	
a	
less	
prominent	
complaint	
.	
	
Additionally	
,	
reports	
of	
insomnia	B-SYMPTOM
,	
poor	B-SYMPTOM
sleep	I-SYMPTOM
quality	I-SYMPTOM
,	
and	
fatigue	B-SYMPTOM
are	
common

Quality

generally	
is	
adversely	
affected	
by	
unrefreshing	B-SYMPTOM
sleep	I-SYMPTOM
,	
sleepiness	B-SYMPTOM

and	
fatigue	B-SYMPTOM
.	
	
Bed	
part-

may	
also	
report	
sleep	
disruption	
and	
associated	
consequences	
.	
	
The	
frequency	
of	
apneas	B-CONCEPT
and	
hypopneas	B-CONCEPT
during	
sleep	
correlates	
poorly	
with	
daytime	
symptom	
severity	
and	
impact	
on	
quality	
of	
life	
.	
	
In	
some	
cases

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
	
The	
major	
predisposing	
factor	
for	
OSA	B-CONDITION
is	
excess	B-RISKFACTOR
body	I-RISKFACTOR
weight	I-RISKFACTOR
.	
	
It	
has	
been	
estimated	
that	
~60	
%	
of	
moderate	
to	
severe	
OSA	B-CONDITION
is	
attributable	
to	
obesity	B-RISKFACTOR
.	
	
The	
risk	
of	
OSA	B-CONDITION
increases	
as	
the	
degree	
of	
additional	
weight	
increases	
,	
with	
an	
extremely	
high	
preva-	
lence	
of	
OSA	B-CONDITION
in	
people	
with	
morbid	B-RISKFACTOR
obesity	I-RISKFACTOR
.	
	
OSA	B-CONDITION
patients	
with	
normal	
or	
below	
-	
nor-	
mal	
body	
weight	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
have	
upper	B-CONCEPT
airway	I-CONCEPT
obstruction	I-CONCEPT
due	
to	
a	
localized	B-CONCEPT
structural	I-CONCEPT
abnormality	I-CONCEPT
such	
as	
a	
maxillomandibular	B-CONCEPT
malformation	I-CONCEPT
or	
adenotonsillar	B-CONCEPT
enlargement	I-CONCEPT
.	
	
Increasing	B-RISKFACTOR
neck	I-RISKFACTOR
circumference	I-RISKFACTOR
predicts	
higher	
AHIs	B-CONCEPT
;	
it	
is	
not	
,	
however	
,	
independent	
of	
BMI	B-CONCEPT
.	
	
Instability	B-RISKFACTOR
in	I-RISKFACTOR
ventilatory	I-RISKFACTOR
control	
appears	
to	
increase	
risk	
of	
OSA	
.	
	
Those	
patients	
with	
an	
exaggerated	B-RISKFACTOR
ventilatory	I-RISKFACTOR
response	I-RISKFACTOR
to	I-RISKFACTOR
a	I-RISKFACTOR
respiratory	I-RISKFACTOR
disturbance	I-RISKFACTOR
have	
a	
greater	
propensity	
for	
obstructive	
events	
.	
	
Menopause	B-RISKFACTOR
is	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
this	
disorder	
in	
women	
,	
even	
after	
adjustment	
for	
age	
and	
BMI	B-CONCEPT
.	
	
However	
,	
use	
of	
hormone	B-TREATMENT
replacement	I-TREATMENT
therapy	I-TREATMENT
may	
be	
protective	
.	
	
There	
are	
conflicting	
data	
concerning	
smoking	B-RISKFACTOR
as	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
OSA	
.	
	
Various	
abnormalities	B-RISKFACTOR
of	I-RISKFACTOR
the	I-RISKFACTOR
bony	I-RISKFACTOR
and	I-RISKFACTOR
soft	I-RISKFACTOR
tissue	I-RISKFACTOR
structures	I-RISKFACTOR
of	I-RISKFACTOR
the	I-RISKFACTOR
head	I-RISKFACTOR
and	I-RISKFACTOR
neck	I-RISKFACTOR
may	
predispose	
the	
individual	
to	
having	
OSA	B-CONDITION
.	
	
These	
may	
be	
hereditary	
(	
e.g.	
,	
mandibular	B-RISKFACTOR
size	I-RISKFACTOR
,	
mandibular	B-RISKFACTOR
position	I-RISKFACTOR
,	
palatal	B-RISKFACTOR
height	I-RISKFACTOR
)	
or	
acquired	
(	
e.g.	
,	
enlarged	B-RISKFACTOR
adenoids	I-RISKFACTOR
and	I-RISKFACTOR
tonsils	I-RISKFACTOR
)	
.	
	
Endocrine	
disorders	
such	
as	
acromegaly	B-RISKFACTOR
and	
hypothy-	B-RISKFACTOR
roidism	I-RISKFACTOR
are	
risk	
factors	
for	
OSA	B-CONDITION
.	
	
Adults	
and	
children	
with	
Down	B-RISKFACTOR
syndrome	I-RISKFACTOR
also	
have	
a	
high	
prevalence	
of	
OSA	B-CONDITION
.	
	
OSA	B-CONDITION
is	
common	
in	
patients	
with	
some	
neurologic	B-RISKFACTOR
disorders	I-RISKFACTOR
that	I-RISKFACTOR
affect	I-RISKFACTOR
peripheral	I-RISKFACTOR
muscles	I-RISKFACTOR
,	
such	
as	
myotonic	B-RISKFACTOR
dystrophy	I-RISKFACTOR
.	
	
OSA	B-CONDITION
is	
likely	
made	
worse	
following	
alcohol	B-RISKFACTOR
consumption	I-RISKFACTOR
or	
use	
of

Children	
with	
OSA	B-CONCEPT
may	
demonstrate	
several	
breathing	B-CONCEPT
patterns	I-CONCEPT
during	
sleep

Some	
children	
have	
cyclic	B-CONCEPT
episodes	I-CONCEPT
of	
obstructive	B-CONDITION
apnea	I-CONDITION
,	
similar	
to	
that	
of	
adults	
with	
the

.	
	
However	
,	
some	
patients	
,	
particularly	
younger	
children	
,	
have	
a	
pattern	
of	
obstructive	B-CONDITION
hypoventilation	I-CONDITION
,	
which	
consists	
of	
long	
periods

persistent	B-CONCEPT

Some	
children	
may	
manifest	
a	
pattern	
of

to	
that	
seen	
in	
adults	
,	
including	
snoring	B-SYMPTOM

In	
children	
,	
upper	B-CONCEPT

occurs	
predominantly	
during

Children

although	
they	
may	
have	
movement

Perhaps	
as	
a	
result	
of	
this	
higher	B-CONCEPT

.	
	
Even	
short	
obstructive	B-CONCEPT
apneas	I-CONCEPT
may	
be	
associated	
with	
severe	
hypoxemia	B-CONDITION
because	
children	
have	
a	
lower	
functional	B-CONCEPT
residual	I-CONCEPT
capacity	I-CONCEPT
and	
a	
higher	
metabolic	B-CONCEPT
rate	I-CONCEPT
than	
adults	
.	
	
Most	
children	
with	
OSA	B-CONDITION
present	
with	
a	
history	
of	
snoring	B-SYMPTOM
and	
difficulty	B-SYMPTOM
breathing	I-SYMPTOM
during	
sleep	
.	
	
Snoring	B-SYMPTOM
is	
usually	
loud	
and	
may	
be	
punctuated	
by	
pauses	
and	
gasps	
,	
with	
associated	
movements	
or	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
.	
	
However	
,	
some	
patients	
,	
particu-	
larly	
infants	
and	
those	
with	
neuromuscular	B-CONCEPT
weakness	I-CONCEPT
,	
may	
not	
snore

Predisposing

-	I-CONDITION
altitude	I-CONDITION
periodic	I-CONDITION

is	
increased	B-RISKFACTOR
ventilatory	I-RISKFACTOR
chemoresponsiveness	I-RISKFACTOR
,	
primarily	
hypoxic	B-RISKFACTOR
ventila-	I-RISKFACTOR
tory	I-RISKFACTOR
responsiveness	I-RISKFACTOR
.	
	
A	
high	
hypoxic	B-CONCEPT
ventilatory	I-CONCEPT
response	I-CONCEPT
will	
lead	
to	
increased	
hyper-	B-CONCEPT
ventilation	I-CONCEPT
on	
ascent	
to	
altitude	
.	
	
This	
hyperventilation	B-CONCEPT
leads	
to	
hypocapnic	B-CONCEPT
alkalosis	I-CONCEPT
that	
,	
during	
sleep	
,	
inhibits	
ventilation	
.	
	
Thus	
,	
repetitive	
cycles	
of	
apnea	B-CONCEPT
and	
hyperpnea	I-CONCEPT
develop	
during	
NREM	B-CONCEPT
sleep	I-CONCEPT
.	
	
The	
obvious	
precipitating	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
this

is	
ascent

A

seems	
to	
be	
a	
major	
predisposing	
factor	
in	
the	
development	
of	
primary	B-CONDITION
CSA	I-CONDITION
.	
	
This	
can	
lead	
to	
the	
instability	
in	
venti-	B-CONCEPT
latory	I-CONCEPT
control	I-CONCEPT
that	
characterizes	
the	
disorder	
.	
	
Frequent	B-RISKFACTOR
arousal	I-RISKFACTOR
from	I-RISKFACTOR
sleep	I-RISKFACTOR
can	
also	
predispose	
to	
the	
development	
of	
central	B-CONCEPT
apneas	I-CONCEPT
,	
as	
ventilatory	B-CONCEPT
control	I-CONCEPT
is	
somewhat	
unstable	
at

wake

Increased	
ventilation	
associated	
with	
arousal	
can	
result	
in	
a	
PaCO2	B-CONCEPT
below	
the	
HAT	B-CONCEPT
after	
the	
return	
to

.	
	
Because	
ventilatory	B-CONCEPT
drive	I-CONCEPT
is	
lower	
during	
REM	B-CONCEPT
than	
NREM	B-CONCEPT
sleep	I-CONCEPT
,	
hypocapnic	B-CONDITION
central	I-CONDITION
apnea	I-CONDITION
is	
much	
less	
common	
during	
that	
sleep	B-CONCEPT

.	
	
Two	
other	
variables	
have	
been	
discussed	
as	
possible	
predispos-	
ing	
factors	
,	
although	
their	
true	
role	
in	
the	
development

this

is	
uncertain

First

frequent

have	
been	
reported	
to	
lead	
to	
an

in	
central	B-CONCEPT

Because

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
	
A	
number	
of	
factors	
have	
been	
hypothesized	
to	
cause	
treatment	B-CONDITION

,	
but	
definitive	
data	
are	
not	
available

The	
patients	
presumably	
have	
characteristics	B-RISKFACTOR
that	I-RISKFACTOR
would	I-RISKFACTOR

often	
a

in	I-RISKFACTOR

Therefore	
,	
any

can	
trigger

to	
the

In	
other	
studies	
,	
patients	
with	
treatment	B-CONDITION

had	
more

However	
,	
identified

vary	
considerably	
from
