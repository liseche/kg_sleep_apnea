Introduction	
Classification	
of	
disorders	
plays	
several	
key	
roles	
in	
medicine	
.	

The	
most	
familiar	
of	
these	
is	
that	
is	
serves	
as	
a	
guide	
to	
clinicians	
in	
the	
identification	
of	
specific	
disease	
states	
.	

In	
doing	
so	
,	
classification	
systems	
provide	
clinicians	
with	
important	
informa-	
tion	
regarding	
numerous	
related	
factors	
including	
pathogenesis	
,	
prognosis	
,	
course	
,	
and	
heritability	
.	

Moreover	
,	
therapeutic	
interventions	
are	
largely	
guided	
by	
the	
nosologi-	
cal	
decisions	
made	
by	
clinicians	
.	

In	
turn	
,	
information	
accrued	
regarding	
therapeutic	
response	
of	
these	
disease	
states	
is	
utilized	
to	
further	
refine	
the	
nosology	
.	

Classification	
systems	
also	
serve	
to	
define	
the	
domain	
of	
a	
given	
discipline	
,	
a	
factor	
of	
particular	
importance	
for	
fields	
such	
as	
sleep	
medicine	
which	
cut	
across	
many	
related	
special-	
ties	
.	

Finally	
,	
by	
identifying	
areas	
of	
uncertainty	
and	
overlap	
among	
related	
patholo-	
gies	
,	
these	
systems	
play	
a	
critical	
role	
in	
guiding	
future	
research	
agendas	
which	
will	
enhance	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
clinical	
features	
,	
pathophysiology	
and	
treatment	
response	
specific	
to	
each	
disorder	
.	

Since	
its	
infancy	
35	
years	
ago	
,	
the	
field	
of	
sleep	
medicine	
has	
paid	
particular	
atten-	
tion	
to	
the	
issue	
of	
classification	
,	
beginning	
with	
the	
1979	
American	
Sleep	
Disorders	
Association	
’s	
Diagnostic	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Arousal	
Disorders	
.	

Since	
that	
time	
,	
as	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
has	
grown	
,	
several	
differ-	
ent	
structural	
approaches	
have	
been	
utilized	
in	
revisions	
of	
the	
classification	
system	
,	
culminating	
in	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
.	

The	
organization	
of	
that	
edition	
,	
although	
not	
without	
its	
limitations	
,	
has	
proven	
effective	
and	
user	
-	
friendly	
and	
has	
been	
maintained	
in	
the	
current	
revision	
.	

Ideally	
,	
classification	
systems	
are	
based	
largely	
on	
pathophysiology	
.	

However	
,	
such	
an	
approach	
is	
dependent	
on	
adequate	
knowledge	
concerning	
the	
various	
pathophysiol-	
ogies	
of	
disease	
or	
disorder	
within	
a	
given	
discipline	
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
with	
many	
diag-	
nostic	
systems	
,	
our	
current	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
many	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
is	
inadequate	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
,	
not	
unlike	
its	
predecessors	
,	
employs	
a	
hybrid	
approach	
which	
utilizes	
pathophysiology	
,	
where	
known	
,	
but	
also	
relies	
heavily	
on	
phenomenology	
and	
organ	
system	
approaches	
.	

Despite	
these	
shortcomings	
,	
this	
approach	
is	
one	
that	
has	
proven	
familiar	
and	
workable	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
clinicians	
.	

Recognizing	
the	
need	
for	
currency	
and	
relevance	
in	
a	
rapidly	
evolving	
field	
,	
the	
American	
Academy	
of	
Sleep	
Medicine	
Board	
of	
Directors	
approved	
a	
revision	
of	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
in	
2011	
.	

Following	
appoint-	
ment	
of	
a	
chair	
/	
editor	
,	
a	
task	
force	
,	
consisting	
of	
individual	
work	
group	
chairs	
for	
each	
Introduction	
major	
division	
of	
the	
manual	
,	
was	
selected	
,	
along	
with	
two	
pediatric	
consultants	
.	

A	
focus	
group	
of	
experts	
was	
convened	
in	
June	
2011	
to	
obtain	
input	
on	
major	
structural	
and	
content	
issues	
.	

Based	
on	
this	
feedback	
,	
individual	
work	
groups	
then	
set	
about	
to	
define	
the	
list	
of	
disorders	
to	
be	
included	
within	
their	
sections	
as	
well	
as	
proposed	
cri-	
teria	
for	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

This	
process	
included	
comprehensive	
literature	
searches	
for	
every	
potential	
diagnosis	
as	
well	
as	
for	
their	
major	
features	
.	

The	
draft	
diagnostic	
crite-	
ria	
which	
emanated	
from	
this	
work	
were	
then	
reviewed	
and	
modified	
by	
the	
task	
force	
(	
consisting	
of	
the	
work	
group	
chairs	
and	
pediatric	
advisors	
)	
,	
as	
well	
as	
by	
the	
board	
of	
the	
AASM	
.	

The	
edited	
criteria	
were	
then	
distributed	
to	
external	
peer	
reviewers	
with	
expertise	
in	
the	
respective	
areas	
,	
as	
well	
as	
to	
international	
societies	
and	
membership	
sections	
of	
the	
AASM	
for	
comment	
.	

These	
reviews	
were	
carefully	
considered	
and	
revi-	
sions	
made	
based	
on	
this	
input	
.	

Subsequent	
to	
this	
,	
text	
revisions	
were	
begun	
and	
the	
same	
review	
process	
and	
modifications	
were	
undertaken	
once	
text	
drafts	
were	
com-	
pleted	
.	

Further	
modifications	
were	
made	
based	
on	
recommendations	
from	
the	
AASM	
board	
before	
finalization	
of	
the	
edition	
.	

At	
all	
points	
in	
this	
process	
,	
efforts	
were	
made	
to	
rely	
as	
heavily	
as	
possible	
on	
available	
and	
current	
scientific	
evidence	
.	

However	
,	
due	
to	
the	
paucity	
of	
available	
evidence	
in	
many	
areas	
,	
decisions	
regarding	
the	
nosol-	
ogy	
were	
often	
made	
by	
consensus	
of	
the	
work	
groups	
,	
task	
force	
,	
and	
reviewers	
.	

Using	
ICSD-3	
As	
noted	
above	
,	
the	
general	
structure	
of	
the	
current	
edition	
closely	
parallels	
that	
of	
the	
second	
edition	
.	

The	
major	
clinical	
divisions	
remain	
unchanged	
.	

As	
with	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
,	
pediatric	
diagnoses	
are	
fully	
integrated	
into	
the	
major	
clinical	
diagnoses	
,	
with	
the	
exception	
of	
obstructive	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
,	
pediatric	
.	

Where	
pediatric	
presentations	
call	
for	
variation	
in	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
,	
those	
variations	
are	
noted	
within	
the	
criteria	
section	
.	

In	
an	
effort	
to	
better	
identify	
those	
clinical	
features	
of	
a	
disorder	
which	
are	
developmentally	
-	
specific	
,	
a	
text	
heading	
for	
Developmental	
Issues	
has	
been	
added	
for	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

Specific	
ICD	
codes	
(	
9	
-	
CM	DISEASE
and	
10	
-	
CM	DISEASE
)	
are	
listed	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

Because	
of	
the	
complexities	
and	
differences	
between	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
diagnoses	
and	
the	
ICD	
system	
,	
assign-	
ment	
of	
codes	
is	
challenging	
.	

These	
issues	
are	
discussed	
further	
under	
Coding	
below	
.	

Although	
classification	
systems	
are	
,	
by	
their	
nature	
,	
intended	
to	
define	
disorders	
in	
the	
most	
specific	
terms	
possible	
,	
clinicians	
must	
recognize	
that	
there	
is	
inevitably	
some	
degree	
of	
variability	
in	
presentation	
which	
may	
result	
in	
clinically	
significant	
conditions	
which	
do	
not	
meet	
all	
specific	
criteria	
for	
a	
given	
diagnosis	
.	

Therefore	
,	
some	
degree	
of	
judgment	
is	
necessary	
in	
the	
application	
of	
these	
criteria	
.	

Bearing	
this	
exception	
in	
mind	
,	
all	
listed	
criteria	
should	
generally	
be	
met	
for	
establishment	
of	
a	
given	
diagnosis	
,	
unless	
otherwise	
specified	
.	

Clinicians	
should	
note	
that	
most	
diagnoses	
within	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
include	
a	
criterion	
,	
or	
cri-	
teria	
,	
that	
connote	
clinical	
significance	
(	
i.e.	
,	
disturbing	
symptoms	
,	
significant	
conse-	
quences	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
distress	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
impairment	DISEASE
in	
one	
or	
more	
functional	
realms	
)	
.	

These	
criteria	
are	
particularly	
important	
because	
,	
without	
them	
,	
many	
phenomena	
related	
to	
sleep	
-	
wake	
do	
not	
rise	
to	
a	
level	
that	
requires	
clinical	
attention	
and	
treatment	
.	

Users	
should	
also	
pay	
particular	
attention	
to	
the	
Notes	
section	
(	
where	
included	
)	
,	
as	
these	
notes	
provide	
essential	
definitions	
and	
details	
concerning	
application	
of	
the	
criteria	
.	

Clinicians	
will	
note	
a	
number	
of	
significant	
content	
changes	
from	
the	
former	
edition	
.	

The	
most	
apparent	
of	
these	
is	
the	
collapse	
of	
all	
previous	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnoses	
into	
a	
single	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
.	

The	
rationale	
for	
this	
is	
described	
in	
the	
introductory	
section	
of	
Insomnia	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

A	
separate	
diagnosis	
is	
retained	
for	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Within	
the	
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
section	
,	
the	
nomenclature	
for	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
has	
been	
changed	
to	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
and	
type	
2	
.	

This	
modification	
is	
discussed	
in	
the	
introduction	
to	
that	
section	
.	

Users	
will	
also	
find	
several	
new	
diagnoses	
within	
the	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
.	

Within	
the	
Central	
Sleep	
Apnea	
Syndromes	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
central	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
now	
appears	
.	

This	
term	
is	
preferred	
to	
the	
widely	
used	
term	
complex	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
because	
it	
describes	
a	
more	
specific	
and	
well	
-	
defined	
disorder	
in	
which	
the	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
arises	
in	
the	
context	
of	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
treatment	
for	
obstructive	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
and	
is	
not	
attributable	
to	
another	
cause	
.	

Central	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
associated	
with	
other	
identi-	DISEASE
fiable	DISEASE
etiologies	DISEASE
such	
as	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
breathing	
or	
substance	
-	
induced	
central	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
are	
not	
classified	
as	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
.	

Assigning	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
a	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
requires	
demonstration	
of	
elevated	
PaCO2	
(	
by	
direct	
measure	
of	
arterial	
blood	
gas	
or	
,	
more	
commonly	
,	
by	
proxy	
measures	
such	
as	
end	
-	
tidal	
or	
trans-	CHEMICAL
cutaneous	
CO2	CHEMICAL
determination	
)	
.	

The	
new	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
disor-	
der	
should	
be	
employed	
when	
there	
is	
sustained	
drop	
in	
SaO2	
but	
PaCO2	
has	
not	
been	
measured	
.	

Within	
the	
parasomnia	DISEASE
section	
,	
a	
single	
set	
of	
general	
criteria	
and	
a	
unified	
text	
now	
describe	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
from	
non	
-	
rapid	
eye	
movement	
sleep	
,	
although	
additional	
,	
specific	
criteria	
and	
separate	
coding	
are	
maintained	
for	
the	
diagnoses	
within	
this	
section	
(	
i.e.	
,	
confusional	
arousal	
,	
sleepwalking	
and	
sleep	
terror	
)	
.	

Other	
,	
somewhat	
less	
consequential	
additions	
,	
deletions	
and	
reassignment	
of	
diagnoses	
also	
appear	
in	
this	
edition	
.	

International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
contained	
a	
separate	
chapter	
for	
Isolated	
Symptoms	
and	
Normal	
Variants	
.	

A	
small	
number	
of	
these	
were	
felt	
to	
qualify	
as	
formal	
diagnoses	
at	
this	
time	
and	
have	
been	
moved	
to	
relevant	
sections	
.	

Other	
symptoms	
and	
variants	
appear	
at	
the	
conclusion	
of	
the	
chapter	
to	
which	
they	
are	
most	
applicable	
(	
e.g.	
,	
snoring	DISEASE
to	
the	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
,	
long	
sleeper	
to	
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
,	
and	
movement	
related	
variants	
to	
the	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	DISEASE
Disorder	DISEASE
section	DISEASE
)

Relationship

Classification	
Systems	
Historically	
,	
there	
have	
been	
three	
major	
classifications	
systems	
for	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Although	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
system	
has	
,	
for	
many	
years	
,	
been	
the	
primary	
nosology	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
specialists	
,	
both	
the	
Diagnostic	
and	
Statistical	
Manual	
of	
Mental	
Disorders	
(	
DSM	
)	
of	
the	
American	
Psychiatric	
Association	
and	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Diseases	
(	
ICD	
)	
nosology	
of	
the	
World	
Health	
Organization	
have	
also	
classified	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Unfortunately	
,	
these	
competing	
systems	
have	
differed	
significantly	
in	
structure	
and	
content	
over	
the	
years	
.	

Development	
of	
DSM-5	DISEASE
was	
ongoing	
during	
the	
development	
of	
this	
manual	
and	
an	
effort	
was	
undertaken	
to	
achieve	
the	
greatest	
degree	
of	
concordance	
possible	
between	
these	
two	
systems	
,	
recognizing	
that	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
will	
inevitably	
contain	
a	
greater	
level	
of	
detail	
than	
DSM	
due	
to	
differences	
in	
their	
target	
users	
.	

This	
goal	
was	
largely	
achieved	
although	
some	
differences	
will	
still	
exist	
.	

The	
major	
change	
to	
the	
Insomnia	DISEASE
section	
(	
i.e.	
establishment	
of	
a	
single	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
)	
within	
this	
new	
system	
is	
paralleled	
in	
DSM-5	DISEASE
.	

Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
diagnoses	
are	
organized	
somewhat	
differently	
in	
the	
DSM	
clas-	
sification	
than	
in	
this	
manual	
and	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
criteria	
differ	
slightly	
.	

Circadian	
Rhythm	
Sleep	
-	
Wake	
Disorder	
diagnoses	
are	
identical	
within	
the	
two	
systems	
with	
the	
exception	
that	
DSM	
does	
not	
include	
a	
jet	
lag	
disorder	
.	

Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
are	
significantly	
more	
detailed	
within	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
than	
DSM-5	DISEASE
,	
although	
the	
organizational	
structures	
in	
this	
section	
are	
quite	
similar	
.	

Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
and	
Parasomnias	DISEASE
are	
likewise	
similar	
but	
with	
fewer	
overall	
diagnoses	
within	
DSM-5	DISEASE
.	

With	
the	
publication	
of	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
,	
a	
major	
effort	
to	
expand	
and	
reorganize	
sleep	
related	
diagnoses	
within	
ICD-9	CHEMICAL
-	
CM	DISEASE
was	
undertaken	
.	

This	
effort	
resulted	
in	
the	
inclusion	
of	
many	
additional	
sleep	
related	
diag-	
noses	
in	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	DISEASE
(	
primarily	
within	
the	
Diseases	
of	
the	
Nervous	
System	
section	
)	
.	

The	
archaic	
distinction	
between	
“	
organic	
”	
and	
“	
non	
-	
organic	
”	
disorders	
has	
histori-	
cally	
been	
a	
guiding	
principle	
of	
ICD	
,	
resulting	
in	
dissemination	
of	
sleep	
diagnoses	
to	
both	
the	
neurological	
and	
mental	
disorder	
categories	
.	

Clinicians	
familiar	
with	
the	
ICD-	
9	
-	
CM	DISEASE
categories	
which	
have	
been	
employed	
since	
the	
most	
recent	
changes	
will	
find	
general	
concordance	
between	
the	
assigned	
diagnostic	
codes	
found	
herein	
and	
the	
most	
current	
version	
of	
ICD-9	CHEMICAL
-	
CM	DISEASE
.	

These	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	DISEASE
codes	
for	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
are	
essen-	
tially	
carried	
over	
to	
ICD-10	
-	
CM	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
certain	
content	
revisions	
in	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
(	
e.g.	
,	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
)	
necessitates	
a	
significant	
departure	
from	
the	
coding	
approach	
utilized	
in	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	DISEASE
and	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
.	

This	
is	
discussed	
further	
below	
.	

Introduction	
Introduction	
Coding	
Diagnostic	
codes	
for	
the	
relevant	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	DISEASE
and	
ICD-10	
-	
CM	DISEASE
diagnoses	
can	
be	
found	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
each	
diagnosis	
section	
of	
the	
book	
.	

In	
the	
United	
States	
,	
the	
former	
codes	
(	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	DISEASE
)	
should	
be	
employed	
until	
the	
implementation	
date	
for	
ICD-10	
-	
CM	DISEASE
which	
,	
at	
the	
time	
of	
this	
writing	
,	
is	
to	
be	
no	
sooner	
than	
October	
1	
,	
2015	
.	

Following	
that	
date	
,	
only	
the	
ICD-10	
-	
CM	DISEASE
codes	
should	
be	
used	
.	

As	
already	
stated	
,	
clinicians	
should	
recognize	
that	
there	
is	
not	
precise	
concordance	
between	
the	
assigned	
codes	
for	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
diagnoses	
and	
the	
diagno-	
ses	
listed	
within	
ICD	
.	

Changes	
to	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
classification	
system	
are	
not	
reflected	
in	
the	
ICD	
system	
for	
many	
years	
.	

Moreover	
,	
the	
ICD	
classification	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
has	
historically	
been	
significantly	
less	
detailed	
than	
ICSD	
(	
particularly	
for	
international	
users	
not	
employing	
the	
Clinical	
Modification	
(	
CM	DISEASE
)	
version	
used	
in	
the	
United	
States	
)	
.	

Hence	
,	
clinicians	
will	
find	
many	
areas	
in	
which	
assigned	
codes	
found	
in	
this	
manual	
do	
not	
correspond	
as	
closely	
as	
one	
would	
like	
to	
ICD	
codes	
.	

Most	
notably	
,	
with	
the	
collapse	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnoses	
into	
a	
single	
disorder	
in	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
,	
the	
assigned	
codes	
for	
this	
diagnosis	
within	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
are	
307.42	
(	
ICD-9	
-	
CM	DISEASE
)	
–	
“	
Nonorganic	
persistent	
disorder	
of	
initiating	
or	
maintaining	
sleep	
”	
and	
F51.01	
(	
ICD-10	
-	
CM	DISEASE
)	
–	
“	
Primary	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	
”	

A	
variety	
of	
other	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnoses	
will	
continue	
to	
appear	
in	
the	
ICD	
system	
but	
,	
with	
the	
classifi-	
cation	
and	
coding	
changes	
recommended	
herein	
,	
these	
become	
essentially	
defunct	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
clinicians	
.	

In	
summary	
,	
the	
assigned	
codes	
in	
this	
edition	
represent	
“	
best	
approximations	
”	
to	
the	
corresponding	
ICD	
codes	
,	
but	
some	
degree	
of	
discrep-	DISEASE
ancy	
between	
the	
systems	
will	
exist	
in	
a	
number	
of	
areas

This	
section	
includes	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
chiefly	
characterized	
by	
the	
complaint	
of	
insom-	
nia	
.	

For	
the	
purpose	
of	
this	
manual	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
defined	
as	
a	
persistent	
difficulty	
with	
sleep	
initiation	
,	
duration	
,	
consolidation	
,	
or	
quality	
that	
occurs	
despite	
adequate	
opportunity	
and	
circumstances	
for	
sleep	
,	
and	
results	
in	
some	
form	
of	
daytime	
impair-	
ment	
.	

These	
three	
components	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
—	
persistent	
sleep	
difficulty	
,	
adequate	
sleep	
opportunity	
,	
and	
associated	
daytime	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
—	
are	
collectively	
implied	
by	
text	
references	
to	
the	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Among	
adults	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
sleep	
complaints	
most	
typically	
include	
difficulties	
initiating	
or	
maintaining	
sleep	
.	

Concerns	
about	
lengthy	
periods	
of	
nocturnal	
wakefulness	
,	
insufficient	
amounts	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
or	
poor	
sleep	
quality	
often	
accompany	
these	
complaints	
.	

Individuals	
who	
report	
these	
sleep	
related	
symptoms	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
impairment	DISEASE
are	
not	
regarded	
as	
having	
an	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
that	
warrants	
clinical	
attention	
other	
than	
education	
and	
reassurance	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
among	
children	
is	
often	
reported	
by	
their	
caretakers	
and	
char-	
acterized	
by	
bedtime	
resistance	
,	
frequent	
nighttime	
awakenings	
and/or	
an	
inability	
to	
sleep	
independently	
.	

Regardless	
of	
the	
exact	
nature	
of	
the	
nocturnal	
sleep	
concerns	
,	
daytime	DISEASE
impairments	DISEASE
are	
reported	
,	
presumably	
caused	
by	
the	
nighttime	
sleep	
diffi-	
culties	
or	
by	
some	
common	
but	
unidentified	
mechanism	
during	
sleep	
and	
wakeful-	
ness	
.	

Daytime	
symptoms	
typically	
include	
fatigue	DISEASE
,	
decreased	DISEASE
mood	DISEASE
or	
irritability	DISEASE
,	
general	
malaise	
,	
and	
cognitive	DISEASE
impairment	DISEASE
.	

Among	
adults	
,	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
impair	
social	
or	
vocational	
functioning	
and	
reduce	
quality	
of	
life	
,	
whereas	
in	
chil-	
dren	
it	
may	
lead	
to	
poor	
school	
performance	
,	
impaired	
attention	
,	
and	
behavioral	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
.	

In	
some	
patients	
,	
physical	
symptoms	
such	
as	
muscle	
tension	
,	
palpita-	
tions	
,	
or	
headache	DISEASE
may	
also	
be	
attributed	
to	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Others	
with	
more	
severe	
forms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
be	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
motor	
vehicle	
and	
work	
-	
site	
acci-	
dents	DISEASE
as	
well	
as	
psychiatric	DISEASE
and	
cardiovascular	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
often	
accompa-	
nies	
comorbid	
medical	
illnesses	
,	
mental	
disorders	
,	
and	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

It	
may	
also	
arise	
in	
association	
with	
the	
use	
,	
abuse	
,	
or	
exposure	
to	
certain	
substances	
.	

When	
insomnia	DISEASE
occurs	
comorbid	DISEASE
to	
these	
conditions	
and	
is	
persistent	
and	
prominent	
,	
a	
sep-	CHEMICAL
arate	CHEMICAL
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnosis	
is	
warranted	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
The	
insomnia	DISEASE
nosology	
presented	
in	
this	
text	
represents	
a	
marked	
departure	
from	
the	
previous	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
insomnia	DISEASE
classification	
system	
in	
terms	
of	
its	
conceptual	
framework	
and	
relative	
simplicity	
.	

The	
previous	
insomnia	DISEASE
nosology	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
promoted	
the	
concept	
that	
insomnia	DISEASE
can	
exist	
as	
a	
primary	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
or	
arise	
as	
a	
secondary	
form	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
related	
to	
an	
underlying	
primary	
psychiatric	DISEASE
,	
medical	
,	
or	
substance	DISEASE
abuse	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
many	
symptoms	
and	
associated	
fea-	
tures	
of	
so	
-	
called	
primary	
and	
secondary	
insomnias	DISEASE
are	
overlapping	
,	
thus	
making	
differentiation	
among	
such	
subtypes	
difficult	
,	
if	
not	
impossible	
.	

There	
is	
increas-	
ing	
recognition	
that	
even	
when	
insomnia	DISEASE
arises	
“	
secondary	
”	
to	
another	
condition	
,	
it	
often	
develops	
an	
independent	
course	
over	
time	
and	
may	
remain	
as	
a	
clinically	
significant	
condition	
,	
even	
if	
the	
so	
-	
called	
primary	
condition	
is	
adequately	
treated	
.	

Evidence	
suggests	
that	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
if	
left	
untreated	
,	
may	
adversely	
affect	
the	
outcome	
of	
these	
comorbid	
conditions	
.	

Moreover	
,	
it	
appears	
that	
treatment	
of	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
improve	
outcome	
of	
both	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
and	
the	
comorbid	
conditions	
.	

Given	
these	
observations	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
seems	
best	
viewed	
as	
a	
comorbid	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
that	
warrants	
separate	
treatment	
attention	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
primary	
vs.	
secondary	
insomnia	DISEASE
distinction	
,	
prior	
editions	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
delineated	
multiple	
putative	
“	
primary	
insomnia	DISEASE
”	
diagnostic	
subtypes	
.	

Specifically	
,	
both	
the	
original	
1990	
version	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
and	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
described	
primary	
insomnia	DISEASE
subtypes	
such	
as	
psycho-	CHEMICAL
physiological	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
idiopathic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
inadequate	
sleep	
hygiene	
,	
and	
paradox-	
ical	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
as	
discrete	
diagnostic	
entities	
.	

Experience	
suggests	
that	
,	
in	
practice	
,	
it	
is	
rare	
to	
encounter	
patients	
who	
meet	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
exclusively	
one	
of	
these	
subtypes	
.	

In	
fact	
,	
many	
of	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
delineated	
for	
these	
subtypes	
represent	
generic	
characteristics	
(	
e.g.	
,	
engaging	
in	
sleep	
-	
disruptive	
habits	
;	
underesti-	
mation	
of	
sleep	
time	
,	
evidence	
of	
conditioned	
arousal	
)	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
per	
se	
,	
and	
do	
not	
facilitate	
discrimination	
among	
these	
subtypes	
or	
between	
these	
subtypes	
and	
those	
presumed	
to	
have	
“	
secondary	
”	
forms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Both	
clinical	
experience	
and	
a	
growing	
body	
of	
empirical	
findings	
have	
shown	
that	
the	
diagnostic	
distinctions	
advocated	
by	
previous	
versions	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
are	
difficult	
to	
reliably	
ascertain	
and	
are	
of	
question-	
able	
validity	
.	

In	
view	
of	
such	
considerations	
,	
the	
current	
manual	
abandons	
the	
previ-	
ously	
employed	
complex	
and	
highly	
specific	
insomnia	DISEASE
classification	
scheme	
described	
by	
the	
original	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
and	
the	
2nd	
Edition	
in	
favor	
of	
a	
more	
global	
and	
defensible	
nosology	
.	

The	
manual

Chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE

by	
chronic	
sleep	
onset	
and/or	
sleep

minimal	
frequency	
and	
duration	
thresholds	
shown	
to	
be	
associated	
with	
clin-	
ically	
significant	
morbidity	
outcomes

Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
sleep

,	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
maintaining	
sleep	
,	
or	
waking	
up

can	
be	
seen	
in	
all	
age	
groups	
.	

Resistance	
going	
to	
bed	
on	
an	
appropriate	
schedule	
and	
difficulty	
sleeping	
without	
parent	
or	
caregiver	
intervention	
is	
seen	
most	
commonly	
in	
children	
and	
older	
adults	
who	
require	
the	
supervision	
of	
a	
caretaker	
due	
to	
a	
significant	
level	
of	
functional	
impairment	
(	
e.g.	
,	
those	
with	
dementia	DISEASE
)	
.	
.	

Some	
patients	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
show	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
sleep	
/	
wake	
difficulties	
lasting	
several	
weeks	
at	
a	
time	
over	
several	
years	
,	
yet	
not	
meet	
the	
three	
-	
month	
duration	
criterion	
for	
any	
single	
such	
episode	
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
these	
patients	
should	
be	
assigned	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
given	
the	
persistence	
of	
their	
intermittent	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
over	
time	
.	
.	

Some	
patients	
who	
use	
hypnotic	
medications	
regularly	
may	
sleep	
well	
and	
not	
meet	
the	
criteria	
for	
an	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
when	
they	
take	
such	
medications	
.	

However	
,	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
such	
medications	
these	
same	
patients	
may	
meet	
the	
above	
criteria	
.	

This	
diagnosis	
would	
apply	
to	
those	
patients	
particularly	
if	
they	
present	
clinically	
and	
voice	
concerns	
about	
their	
inability	DISEASE
to	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
without	DISEASE
their	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
medications	
.	
.	

Many	
comorbid	
conditions	
such	
as	
chronic	DISEASE
pain	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
or	
gast-	
roesophageal	
reflux	
disease	
(	
GERD	DISEASE
)	
may	
cause	
the	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaints	
delineated	
here	
.	

When	
such	
conditions	
are	
the	
sole	
cause	
of	
the	
sleep	
difficulty	
,	
a	
separate	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnosis	
may	
not	
apply	
.	

However	
,	
in	
many	
patients	
such	
conditions	
are	
chronic	
and	
are	
not	
the	
sole	
cause	
of	
sleep	
difficulty	
.	

Key	
determining	
factors	
in	
the	
decision	
to	
invoke	
a	
separate	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnosis	
include	
:	
“	
How	
much	
of	
the	
time	
does	
the	
sleep	
difficulty	
arise	
as	
a	
result	
of	
factors	
directly	
attributable	
to	
the	
comorbid	
condition	
(	
e.g.	
,	
pain	DISEASE
or	
GERD	DISEASE
)	
?	
”	

or	
“	
Are	
there	
times	
that	
the	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaints	
occur	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
these	
factors	
?	
”	

“	
Have	
perpetuating	
cognitive	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
behavioral	DISEASE
factors	DISEASE
(	DISEASE
e.g.	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
negative	DISEASE
expectations	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
conditioned	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE

disruptive	DISEASE
habits	DISEASE
)	
arisen	
,	
suggesting	
an	
autonomous	
aspect	
to	
the	
ongoing	
insomnia	DISEASE
?	
”	

If	
there	
is	
evidence	
that	
the	
patient	
’s	
sleep/	
wake	
complaints	
are	
not	
solely	
caused	
by	
the	
medical	
condition	
,	
and	
those	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaints	
seem	
to	
merit	
separate	
treatment	
attention	
,	
then	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
be	
made	
.	

Essential	
Features	
The	
essential	
feature	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
a	
frequent	
and	
persistent	
difficulty	
initiating	
or	
maintaining	
sleep	
that	
results	
in	
general	
sleep	
dissatisfaction	
.	

The	
sleep	
complaint	
is	
accompanied	
by	
distress	
about	
poor	
sleep	
and/or	
impairment	
in	
family	
,	
social	
,	
vocational	
,	
academic	
,	
or	
other	
important	
areas	
of	
functioning	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
and	
associated	
waking	
symptoms	
occur	
despite	
having	
adequate	
time	
and	
circumstances	
each	
night	
to	
obtain	
necessary	
sleep	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
dis-	
order	
can	
occur	
in	
isolation	
or	
comorbidly	DISEASE
with	
a	
mental	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
medical	
condition	
,	
or	
substance	
use	
.	

The	
sleep	
complaints	
that	
comprise	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
include	
difficul-	
ties	
initiating	
sleep	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
maintaining	
sleep	
.	

The	
latter	
complaint	
may	
include	
waking	
up	
during	
the	
night	
with	
difficulty	
returning	
to	
sleep	
or	
having	
a	
final	
awaken-	
ing	
occurring	
too	
early	
,	
well	
before	
the	
desired	
rising	
time	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
be	
characterized	
solely	
by	
sleep	
onset	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
or	
,	
more	
commonly	
,	
by	
both	
types	
of	
complaints	
occurring	
together	
.	

Individuals	
’	
sleep	
com-	
plaints	
may	
also	
change	
over	
time	
such	
that	
those	
with	
solely	
sleep	
onset	
complaints	
may	
subsequently	
develop	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
and	
vice	
versa	
.	

Also	
,	
those	
who	
present	
initially	
with	
mixed	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sleep	DISEASE
maintenance	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
may	
later	
evidence	
one	
or	
the	
other	
of	
these	
difficulties	
but	
not	
both	
.	

Complaints	
about	
poor	
-	
quality	
,	
unrefreshing	DISEASE
,	
or	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
often	
accompany	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
,	
but	
do	
not	
suffice	
to	
define	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
when	
occurring	
as	
the	
sole	
sleep	
complaint	
.	

The	
degree	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
required	
to	
assign	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diag-	

nosis	
is	
somewhat	
arbitrary	
in	
that	
it	
relies	
primarily	
on	
individuals	
’	DISEASE
subjective	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
Insomnia	DISEASE
Insomnia	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
.	

Moreover	
,	
the	
degree	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
required	
to	
connote	
clinical	
significance	
varies	
across	
age	
groups	
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
sleep	
onset	
latencies	
and	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
after	
sleep	
onset	
>	
20	
minutes	
generally	
connote	
clinically	
significant	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbances	DISEASE
in	
children	
and	
young	
adults	
.	

In	
middle	
and	
older	
aged	
adults	
,	
onset	
latencies	
and	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
during	
sleep	
>	
30	
minutes	
typically	
connote	
clin-	
ical	
significance	
.	

Complaints	
of	
early	
morning	
awakening	
are	
less	
well	
defined	
,	
but	
typically	
entail	
the	
termination	
of	
sleep	
at	
least	
30	
minutes	
before	
the	
desired	
rising	
time	
and	
a	
concomitant	
reduced	
total	
sleep	
time	
compared	
with	
the	
usual	
premorbid	
sleep	
pattern	
.	

The	
exact	
time	
at	
which	
early	
morning	
awakenings	
occur	
may	
vary	
con-	
siderably	
as	
a	
function	
of	
usual	
bedtimes	
.	

For	
example	
,	
a	
final	
awakening	
at	
4:00	
a.m.	
is	
likely	
to	
connote	
clinical	
significance	
when	
the	
usual	
bedtime	
is	
11:00	
p.m.	

but	
not	
when	
the	
usual	
bedtime	
occurs	
at	
9:00	
p.m.	

Symptoms	
during	
wakefulness	
accompany	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
and	
result	
in	
the	
impairment	
of	
normal	
functioning	
.	

Common	
waking	
symptoms	
include	
fatigue	DISEASE
;	
reduced	
motivation	
;	
reduced	
concentration	
,	
attention	
,	
and	
memory	
functioning	
;	
and	
irritability	DISEASE
or	
reduced	
mood	
.	

Complaints	
of	
subjective	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
are	
also	
common	
,	
although	
,	
in	
contrast	
to	
patients	
with	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
conditions	
,	
many	
with	
this	
complaint	
are	
not	
able	
to	
nap	
in	
the	
daytime	
and	
few	
show	
unintentional	
sleep	
episodes	
.	

Reports	
of	
reduced	
performance	
at	
work	
or	
school	
or	
impaired	
social	
functioning	
also	
are	
common	
.	

Some	
affected	
individuals	
attribute	
errors	
or	
accidents	DISEASE
at	
work	
to	
their	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
.	

Somatic	
symptoms	
such	
as	
headaches	DISEASE
or	
gastrointes-	
tinal	
dysfunction	
are	
occasionally	
attributed	
to	
the	
ongoing	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
as	
well	
.	

The	
fatigue	DISEASE
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
sufferers	
is	
manifest	
mainly	
as	
a	
lack	
of	
energy	
and	
desire	
to	
reduce	
or	
limit	
activity	
levels	
.	

This	
symptom	
should	
be	
differentiated	
from	
reports	
of	
subjective	
sleepiness	DISEASE
as	
well	
as	
from	
unintended	
sleep	
episodes	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
sufferers	
commonly	
report	
subjective	
sleepiness	
characterized	
by	
a	
sense	
of	
reduced	
alertness	DISEASE
and	
enhanced	
need	
or	
desire	
to	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
they	
seldom	
fall	
asleep	
spontaneously	
without	
intending	
to	
do	
so	
.	

Despite	
a	
desire	
to	
nap	
,	
many	
individuals	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
are	
unable	
to	
do	
so	
.	

Frequent	
,	
unintentional	
daytime	
sleep	
episodes	
are	
more	
characteristic	
of	
other	
types	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
sleep	DISEASE
disordered	DISEASE
breathing	DISEASE
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
idio-	DISEASE
pathic	DISEASE
hypersomnia	DISEASE
,	
and	
the	
like	
.	

In	
young	
children	
,	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
,	
staying	
asleep	
,	
or	
both	
are	
often	
the	
result	
of	
inappropriate	
sleep	
associations	
or	
inadequate	
limit	
setting	
.	

Inappropriate	
sleep	
associ-	

ations	
result	
from	
a	
child	
’s	DISEASE
dependency	DISEASE
on	
specific	
stimulation	
,	
objects	
,	
or	
settings	
for	
initiating	
sleep	
or	
returning	
to	
sleep	
following	
an	
awakening	
;	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
these	
conditions	
,	
sleep	
onset	
is	
significantly	
delayed	
.	

This	
manifestation	
usually	
presents	
as	
frequent	
nighttime	
awakenings	
and/or	
nighttime	
fears	
or	
anxiety	DISEASE
about	
sleeping	
alone	
.	

The	
process	
of	
falling	
asleep	
is	
associated	
with	
a	
specific	
form	
of	
stimulation	
(	
e.g.	
,	
rocking	
,	
watching	
television	
)	
,	
object	
(	
e.g.	
,	
bottle	
,	
excessive	
feedings	
)	
,	
or	
setting	
(	
e.g.	
,	
lighted	
room	
,	
parents	
remaining	
in	
the	
room	
,	
or	
child	
taken	
to	
parents	
’	DISEASE
bed	
)	
.	

When	
such	
conditions	
are	
absent	
,	
children	
with	
this	
disorder	
experience	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
bedtime	
and	
following	
normal	
nighttime	
arousals	DISEASE
.	

If	
the	
conditions	
associ-	
ated	
with	
falling	
asleep	
are	
reestablished	
,	
the	
child	
usually	
resumes	
sleep	
relatively	
quickly	
.	

Because	
sleep	
-	
onset	
associations	
are	
highly	
prevalent	
in	
young	
children	
,	
the	
phenomenon	
is	
defined	
as	
a	
disorder	
only	
if	
(	
1	
)	
the	
associations	
are	
highly	
problem-	
atic	
or	
demanding	
(	
e.g.	
,	
extended	
rocking	
,	
car	
rides	
)	
;	
(	
2	
)	
sleep	
onset	
is	
significantly	
delayed	
or	
sleep	
is	
otherwise	
disrupted	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
the	
associated	
conditions	
;	
and	
(	
3	
)	
caregiver	
intervention	
is	
frequently	
required	
to	
aid	
the	
onset	
or	
resumption	
of	
sleep	
.	

Limit	
-	
setting	
issues	
are	
characterized	
by	
bedtime	
stalling	
or	
bedtime	
refusal	
that	
is	
met	
with	
and	
reinforced	
by	
inadequate	
limit	
setting	
by	
a	
caregiver	
.	

Sleep	
problems	
occur	
when	
caregivers	
institute	
no	
or	
few	
limits	
or	
when	
limits	
are	
instituted	
inconsistently	
or	
in	
an	
unpredictable

sleep	
problems	
may	
also	
result	
in	
prolonged	
nocturnal	DISEASE
awakenings	DISEASE
,	
depending	
on	
caregiver	
response	
during	
the	
night	
.	

It	
also	
should	
be	
noted	
that	
some	
children	
’s	
needs	
for	
specific	
conditions	
for	
sleeping	
or	
their	
resistance	
to	
go	
to	
bed	
may	
reflect	
underlying	
anxiety	DISEASE
or	
fears	
.	

Fear	
of	
sleep-	
ing	
alone	
,	
being	
in	
the	
dark	
,	
or	
having	
nightmares	
may	
lead	
some	
children	
to	
demand	
certain	
sleep	
promoting	
conditions	
(	
presence	
of	
parent	
in	
bedroom	
)	
or	
to	
repeatedly	
delay	
their	
bedtimes	
.	

Although	
transient	
and	
episodic	
forms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
occur	
,	
the	
clinically	
significant	
daytime	
consequences	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
the	
longer	
term	
,	
more	
serious	
morbidity	
out-	
comes	
most	
typically	
develop	
when	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
occur	
at	
least	
three	
times	
per	
week	
and	
persist	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
.	

For	
this	
reason	
,	
these	
frequency	
and	
dura-	
tion	
criteria	
must	
be	
met	
for	
the	
assignment	
of	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE

diagnosis	
.	

However	
,	
it	
is	
recognized	
that	
more	
acute	
and	
episodic	
forms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
cause	
significant	
distress	DISEASE
and	
functional	
impairment	
and	
require	
clinical	
attention	
.	

Cases	
that	
meet	
all	
criteria	
except	
the	
frequency	
or	
duration	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
be	
assigned	
a

Associated	
Features	
Individuals	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
typically	
note	
feelings	
of	
reduced	
well	
-	
being	
and	
general	
malaise	
during	
the	
day	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
excessive	
focus	
on	
and	
worry	DISEASE
about	
ongoing	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
and	
their	
associated	
daytime	
consequences	
are	
common	
.	

Thoughts	
about	
ongoing	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
may	
occur	
through	
the	
day	
and	
may	
be	
amplified	
as	
bedtime	
Insomnia	DISEASE
Insomnia	DISEASE
approaches

Frank	
performance	
anxiety	DISEASE
about	
sleep	
is	
common	
.	

Although	
many	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
appear	
anxious	
and	
worry	
-	
prone	
,	
their	
anxiety	DISEASE
and	
worry	DISEASE
are	
often	
focused	
mainly	
on	
their	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
.	

When	
anxiety	DISEASE
and	
worry	DISEASE
are	
more	
pervasive	
and	
not	
solely	
focused	
on	
sleep	
problems	
,	
a	
comorbid	DISEASE
anxiety	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
.	

Many	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
show	
a	
pattern	
of	
conditioned	
arousal	
in	
response	
to	
envi-	
ronmental	
cues	
in	
their	
bedrooms	
or	
conscious	
efforts	
to	
initiate	
sleep	
.	

Such	
individuals	
may	
fall	
asleep	
easily	
in	
settings	
outside	
of	
their	
bedrooms	
when	
not	
trying	
to	
sleep	
,	
but	
show	
a	
pattern	
of	
cognitive	
and	
physiological	
arousal	
when	
lying	
down	
in	
their	
beds	
with	
the	
intention	
to	
fall	
asleep	
.	

Some	
patients	
with	
this	
pattern	
may	
report	
sleeping	
better	
when	
away	
from	
home	
than	
when	
at	
home	
.	

Unlike	
noncomplaining	
normal	
sleepers	
,	
indi-	
viduals	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
often	
express	
conscious	
intentions	
and	
excessive	
effort	
to	
sleep	
,	
only	
to	
find	
sleep	
difficult	
to	
initiate	
under	
such	
circumstances	
.	

In	
children	
,	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
may	
be	
accompanied	
by	
daytime	
behavioral	
prob-	
lems	
and	
limit	
-	
setting	
difficulties	
during	
the	
day	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
nighttime	
sleep	
distur-	
bance	
often	
results	
in	
poor	
parental	
sleep	
and	
associated	
daytime	DISEASE
impairment	DISEASE
.	

Marital	
conflicts	
regarding	
how	
to	
respond	
to	
or	
intervene	
with	
the	
ongoing	
sleep	
problem	
may	
arise	
.	

Parents	
also	
may	
develop	
negative	
feelings	
toward	
the	
child	
who	
disrupts	
their	
sleep	
and	
demands	
their	
attention	
during	
the	
night

subtypes	
are	
delin-

The	
specific	
primary	
insomnia	DISEASE
subtypes	
listed	
in	
the	
previous	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
include	
the	
following	
:	
Psychophysiological	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
primarily	
by	
heightened	
arousal	
and	
learned	
sleep	
-	
preventing	
associations	
that	
result	
in	
a	
complaint	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
presumed	
to	
have	
this	
type	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
often	
have	
sleep	
difficulty	
when	
trying	
to	
sleep	
in	
their	
usual	
sleep	
setting	
at	
home	
but	
may	
fall	
asleep	
easily	
in	
a	
novel	
sleep	
setting	
or	
when	
not	
trying	
to	
sleep	
.	

They	
also	
demonstrate	
excessive	
focus	
on	
and	
worry	DISEASE
about	
sleep	
and	
suffer	
from	
elevated	
levels	
of	
cognitive	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
somatic	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
,	
particularly	
at	
bedtime	
.	

Idiopathic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
longstanding	
complaint	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
with	
insidious	DISEASE
onset	
occurring	
during	
infancy	
or	
early	
childhood	
.	

It	
is	
presumed	
to	
arise	
in	
infancy	
or	
early	
childhood	
without	
discernible	
cause	
and	
to	
persist	
over	
time	
without	
sustained	
periods	
of	
remission	
.	

Given	
its	
early	
onset	
,	
stability	
over	
time	
,	
and	
lifelong	
course	
,	
this	
disorder	
is	
thought	
to	
arise	
from	
either	
genetically	
determined	
or	
congenital	DISEASE
aberrations	DISEASE
in	
the	
sleep	
-	
inducing	
or	
arousal	
systems	
in	
the	
brain	
,	
or	
both	
.	

No	
consistent	
genetic	
markers	
or	
neural	
pathology	
have	
been	
identified	
among	
those	
presumed	
to	
suffer	
from	
this	
condition	
.	

Paradoxical	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
which	
has	
previously	
been	
called	
sleep	
state	
misperception	
,	
is	
described	
as	
a	
complaint	
of	
severe	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
without	
corroborative	
objective	
evidence	
of	
the	
degree	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
claimed	
.	

Those	
presumed	
to	
have	
this	
form	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulty	DISEASE
have	
a	
marked	
propensity	
to	
underestimate	
the	
amount	
of	
sleep	
they	
actually	
are	
obtaining	
.	

In	
essence	
,	
they	
are	
thought	
to	
perceive	
much	
of	
the	
time	
they	
actually	
sleep	
as	
wakefulness	
.	

Although	
many	
such	
patients	
routinely	
obtain	
norma-	
tive	DISEASE
amounts	
of	
sleep	
,	
as	
documented	
by	
standard	
polysomnographic	
measures	
,	
they	
complain	
of	
the	
common	
sleep	
/	
wake	
symptoms	
of	
other	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Some	
studies	
using	
neuroimaging	
or	
sleep	
electroencephalograph	
(	
EEG	
)	
spectral	
analysis	
techniques	
have	
suggested	
that	
an	
altered	
sleep	
/	
wake	
arousal	
system	
in	
such	
individ-	
uals	
may	
explain	
the	
apparent	
mismatch	
between	
their	
conventional	
objective	
sleep	
measures	
and	
subjective	
sleep	
reports	
.	

Inadequate	
sleep	
hygiene	
is	
presumed	
to	
result	
from	
or	
be	
sustained	
by	
daily	
living	
activities	
that	
are	
inconsistent	
with	
the	
maintenance	
of	
good	
-	
quality	
sleep	
and	
normal	
daytime	
alertness	
.	

Patients	
with	
this	
form	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
have	
ongoing	
sleep/	DISEASE
wake	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
as	
a	
function	
of	
practices	
such	
as	
daytime	DISEASE
napping	DISEASE
,	
maintaining	
a	
highly	
variable	
sleep	
/	
wake	
schedule	
,	
routinely	
using	
sleep	
-	
disruptive	
products	
(	
caf-	
feine	
,	
tobacco	
,	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
)	
too	
close	
to	
bedtime	
,	
engaging	
in	
mentally	
or	
physically	
acti-	
vating	
or	
emotionally	
upsetting	
activities	
too	
close	
to	
bedtime	
,	
routinely	
using	
the	
bed	
and	
bedroom	
for	
activities	
other	
than	
sleep	
,	
or	
failing	
to	
maintain	
a	
comfortable	
environment	
for	
sleep	
.	

Behavioral	
insomnia	DISEASE
of	
childhood	
is	
presumed	
to	
result	
from	
improper	
sleep	
train-	
ing	
or	
limit	
setting	
by	
parents	
or	
caretakers	
.	

Within	
this	
broader	
diagnosis	
,	
several	
subtypes	
have	
been	
described	
.	

Sleep	
-	
onset	
association	
type	
is	
characterized	
by	
the	
child	
’s	DISEASE
dependency	DISEASE
on	
specific	
stimulation	
,	
objects	
,	
or	
settings	
for	
initiating	
sleep	
or	
returning	
to	
sleep	
following	
an	
awakening	
;	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
these	
conditions	
,	
sleep	
onset	
is	
significantly	
delayed	
.	

Limit	
-	
setting	
type	
is	
characterized	
by	
bedtime	
stalling	
or	
bedtime	
refusal	
that	
is	
the	
result	
of	
inadequate	
limit	
setting	
by	
a	
caregiver	
.

Insomnia	DISEASE
Insomnia	DISEASE
characterized	
by

subtype	
within	
this	
diagnostic	
category

The	
DSM	
-	
IV	
-	
TR	
and	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
2nd	
Edition	
also	
describe	
several	
so	
-	
called	
secondary	
insomnias	DISEASE
,	
arising	
from	
co	
-	
occurring	
primary	
or	
causative	
conditions	
.	

Among	
these	
are	
the	
following	
:	
Insomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
(	
another	
)	
mental	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
thought	
to	
be	
caused	
by	
or	
secondary	
to	
a	
co	
-	
occurring	
psychiatric	DISEASE
condition	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
is	
a	
common	
complaint	
,	
particularly	
among	
patients	
with	
mood	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
and	
anxiety	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Likewise	
,	
sleep	
distur-	
bance	
is	
commonly	
seen	
in	
those	
with	
psychotic	DISEASE
spectrum	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
and	
various	
Axis	
II	
(	
personality	
)	
disorders	
.	

Among	
those	
individuals	
presumed	
to	
have	
insomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
mental	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
has	
historically	
been	
regarded	
as	
a	
secondary	
symptom	
,	
caused	
by	
the	
mental	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
itself	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
(	
a	
)	
medical	
condition	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
caused	
by	
or	
secondary	
to	
a	
co	
-	
occurring	
medical	
condition	
.	

Like	
the	
mental	
disorders	
,	
many	
medical	
condi-	
tions	
may	
have	
an	
ongoing	
insomnia	DISEASE
complaint	
associated	
with	
them	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
those	
conditions	
that	
cause	
some	
form	
of	
ongoing	
pain	DISEASE
or	
discomfort	
,	
mobility	
lim-	
itation	
,	
or	
breathing	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
commonly	
have	
insomnia	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
accompanying	
them	
.	

Among	
those	
individuals	
presumed	
to	
have	
insomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disor-	
der	DISEASE
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
has	
historically	
been	
regarded	
as	
a	
secondary	
symptom	
,	
caused	
by	
the	
medical	
disorder	
itself	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
drug	
or	
substance	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
caused	
by	
or	
secondary	
to	
use	
of	
or	
withdrawal	
from	
a	
drug	
or	
substance	
.	

Many	
forms	
of	
prescription	
and	
nonprescrip-	
tion	
medications	
,	
street	
drugs	
,	
and	
other	
commonly	
used	
substances	
may	
produce	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbances	DISEASE
either	
during	
periods	
of	
use	
or	
upon	
withdrawal	
.	

Given	
these	
effects	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
complaints	
may	
arise	
either	
during	
periods	
when	
these	
substances	
are	
used	
or	
following	
their	
discontinuance	
.	

Among	
those	
individuals	
presumed	
to	
have	
insom-	
nia	
due	
to	
drug	
or	
substance	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
has	
historically	
been	
regarded	
as	
a	
secondary	
symptom	
,	
caused	
by	
the	
drug	
or	
substance	
itself	
.	

Despite	
the	
heuristic	
appeal	
of	
these	
various	
subtypes	
,	
it	
is	
often	
difficult	
to	
discrim-	
inate	
among	
them	
in	
clinical	
practice	
.	

Many	
of	
the	
defining	
features	
of	
the	
so	
-	
called	
primary	
insomnia	DISEASE
subtypes	
such	
as	
conditioned	
arousal	
,	
poor	
sleep	
hygiene	
prac-	
tices	
,	
and	
underestimation	
of	
sleep	
time	
are	
ubiquitous	
among	
insomnia	DISEASE
sufferers	
,	
per	
se	
,	
and	
are	
not	
specific	
to	
one	
subgroup	
.	

This	
is	
true	
whether	
the	
so	
-	
called	
primary	
insomnia	DISEASE
subtypes	
are	
considered	
in	
isolation	
or	
if	
all	
of	
the	
primary	
and	
secondary	
subtypes	
mentioned	
are	
considered	
.	

There	
is	
substantial	
symptom	
overlap	
both	
within	
the	
group	
of	
primary	DISEASE
insomnias	DISEASE
as	
well	
as	
among	
the	
primary	
and	
secondary	
insomnias	DISEASE
.	

Furthermore	
,	
many	
individuals	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
have	
mul-	
tiple	
medical	
and	
psychiatric	DISEASE
comorbidities	
,	
making	
it	
difficult	
to	
assign	
causation	
to	
any	
single	
factor	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
discrimination	
among	
these	
subtypes	
has	
proven	
difficult	
given	
their	
current	
definitions	
and	
available	
methods	
for	
their	
ascertain-	
ment	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
it	
is	
not	
clear	
that	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
always	
the	
result	
of	
co	
-	
occur-	
ring	
medical	
,	
mental	
,	
or	
substance	
use	
disorders	
.	

Often	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
precede	
the	
onset	
of	
such	
conditions	
,	
and	
even	
when	
precipitated	
by	
such	
conditions	
,	
the	
insom-	
nia	
may	
evolve	
and	
develop	
partial	
or	
total	
independence	
over	
time	
.	

In	
such	
cir-	
cumstances	
,	
the	
term	
secondary	
insomnia	DISEASE
seems	
inappropriate	
.	

Currently	
there	
is	
limited	
understanding	
of	
mechanistic	
pathways	
in	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
so	
it	
is	
not	
possible	
to	
draw	
firm	
conclusions	
about	
the	
association	
or	
direction	
of	
causality	
between	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
such	
co	
-	
occurring	
conditions	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
other	
than	
the	
differing	
treatments	
required	
for	
distinctive	
comorbidities	
,	
efficacious	
treatments	
for	
insomnia	DISEASE
generally	
are	
similar	
across	
the	
range	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
subtypes	
.	

Finally	
,	
research	
has	
provided	
very	
limited	
support	
for	
the	
reliability	
and	
validity	
of	
the	
various	
specific	
subtypes	
discussed	
.

setting	
by	
parents	
or	
caretakers	
.	

Although	
perhaps	
more	
common	
in	
young	
children	
,	
inappropriate	
sleep	
associations	
can	
occur	
in	
older	
age	
groups	
.	

For	
example	
,	
adults	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
report	
intolerance	
for	
quiet	
and	
dark	
settings	
and	
may	
not	
be	
able	
to	
fall	
asleep	
unless	
the	
television	
is	
on	
.	

Similarly	
,	
it	
is	
not	
clear	
that	
limit	
-	
setting	
issues	
are	
involved	
in	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
of	
only	
young	
children	
.	

Such	
difficulties	
also	
can	
manifest	
during	
adolescence	
as	
a	
function	
of	
volitionally	
delaying	
bedtimes	
.	

Similarly	
,	
they	
may	
occur	
in	
older	
,	
cognitively	
impaired	
adults	
when	
their	
caretak-	
ers	
allow	
liberal	
daytime	
napping	
that	
in	
turn	
results	
in	
disruptive	DISEASE
awakenings	DISEASE
and	
night	
wandering	
.	

It	
is	
also	
clear	
that	
many	
of	
the	
features	
of	
sleep	
/	
wake	
dysfunc-	
tion	
assigned	
to	
this	
childhood	
insomnia	DISEASE
subtype	
overlap	
substantially	
with	
the	
global	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Given	
these	
considerations	
,	
a	
separate	
childhood	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagno-	
sis	
is	
of	
questionable	
merit	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
these	
various	
subtypes	
,	
a	
distinctive	
subtype	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
with	
objectively	
short	
sleep	
duration	
has	
been	
recently	
described	
.	

This	
group	
is	
characterized	
by	
insom-	
nia	
complaints	
,	
along	
with	
an	
objectively	
documented	
average	
sleep	
time	
less	
than	
six	
hours	
per	
night	
and	
elevated	
morbidity	
risk	
.	

Because	
evidence	
in	
support	
of	
this	
Insomnia	DISEASE
Insomnia	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
currently	
limited	
,	
it	
is	
premature	
to	
delineate	
a	
separate	
insomnia	DISEASE
category	
for	
this	
presentation	
at	
this	
juncture	
.	

Given	
all	
of	
these	
considerations	
,	
a	
more	
global	
and	
defensible	
approach	
has	
been	
chosen	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
those	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
.	

Specifically	
,	
the	
single	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
provided	
for	
all	
patients	
who	
have	
per-	
sistent	
and	
frequent	
insomnia	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
whether	
they	
occur	
in	
the	
presence	
or	
absence	
of	
a	
potentially	
sleep	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
disruptive	DISEASE
comorbid	DISEASE
psychiatric	DISEASE
illness	DISEASE
,	
medical	
disorder	
,	
or	
pattern	
of

use	
.	

Demographics	
The	
full	
clinical	
syndrome	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
occurs	
in	
about	
10	
%	
of	
the	
population	
,	
but	
the	
prevalence	
of	
transient	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
is	
much	
higher	
(	
30	
%	
to	
35	
%	
of	
the	
population	
)	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
more	
common	
in	
women	
,	
those	
with	
medical	
/	
psychiatric	DISEASE
/	
substance	
disorders	
,	
and	
in	
people	
in	
lower	
socioeco-	
nomic	
strata	
.	

It	
may	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
but	
is	
more	
commonly	
diagnosed	
in	
older	
adults	
,	
most	
likely	
due	
to	
age	
-	
related	
deterioration	
in	
sleep	
continuity	
and	
increase	
in	
medical	
comorbidities	
and	
medication	
use	
that	
increase	
insomnia	DISEASE
risk	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
associated	
with	
requirements	
of	
parental	
/	
caregiver	
presence	
at	
bedtime	
and/or	
during	
the	
night	
,	
along	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
limit	
-	
setting	
difficulties	
,	
are	
estimated	
to	
occur	
in	
10	
%	
to	
30	
%	
of	
children	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
exact	
definitions	
used	
.	

Certain	
subgroups	
of	
children	
,	
such	
as	
those	
suffering	
from	
chronic	
illnesses	
or	
neurodevelopmental	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
have	
a	
somewhat	
higher	
prevalence	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
.	

Because	
children	
are	
not	
expected	
to	
sleep	
through	
the	
night	
with	
reg-	
ularity	
until	
they	
are	
three	
to	
six	
months	
of	
age	
,	
six	
months	
is	
a	
reasonable	
age	
to	
first	
consider	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
unless	
the	
sleeplessness	DISEASE
is	
very	
marked	
at	
an	
earlier	
age	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
sleep	
-	
onset	
associations	
and	
limit	
-	
set-	
ting	
problems	
are	
strongly	
associated	
with	
caregivers	DISEASE
’	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
,	
bedtime	
interac-	
tions	
,	
and	
culture	
.	

Thus	
,	
the	
interpretation	
of	
the	
nighttime	
awakenings	
and	
demands	
for	
parental	
contact	
should	
be	
considered	
in	
the	
context	
of	
the	
family	
and	
culture	
.	

Identification	
of	
sleep	
problems	
in	
children	
and	
adolescents	
are	
often	
based	
on	
spe-	
cific	
cultural	
definitions	
.	

Studies	
on	
adolescents	
indicate	
prevalence	
rates	
of	
3	
%	
to	
12	
%	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
utilized	
,	
with	
higher	
frequency	
in	
girls	
than	
boys	
after	
puberty	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Individuals	
who	
have	
difficulty	
sleeping	
during	
stressful	
times	
or	
who	
report	
being	
habitual	
light	
sleepers	
appear	
to	
have	
elevated	
propensity	
to	
develop	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Prior	
transient	
episodes	
of	
poor	
sleep	
elevate	
the	
risk	
for	
subsequent	
development	
of	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Job

related	
stress

such	
as

a	
marked	
change	
in	
work

and	
other	
major

changes	
are	
often	
precipitating	
circumstances	
for	
chronic

Personality

that	
produce	
anxious	
overconcern	
about	
health	
,	
general	
well	
-	
being	
,	
or	
daytime	
func-	
tioning	
may	
serve	
as	
predisposing	
characteristics	
because	
individuals	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
often	
display	
excessive	
preoccupation	
with	
daytime	
consequences	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
and	
they	
devote	
particular	
effort	
to	
what	
they	
presume	
are	
sleep

promot-	
ing	
practices	
.	

A	
psychological	
style	
characterized	
by	
the	
repression	
and	
internalization	
of	
disturbing	
affect	
is	
characteristic	
of	
those	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
and	
also	
may	
represent	
a	
predisposing	
trait	
.	

Parents	
who	
have	
unrealistic	
sleep	
expectations	
for	
their	
children	
may	
predispose	
them	
to	
insomnia	DISEASE
by	
putting	
them	
in	
bed	
too	
early	
or	
assigning	
them	
too	
much	
time	
in	
bed	
each	
night

Comorbid	DISEASE
psychiatric	DISEASE
conditions	
,	
particularly	
mood

are	
asso-

Likewise

comorbid	DISEASE
restless	DISEASE

also	
are	
associated	
with	
increased

A

abuse	DISEASE
as	
well	
as	
the	
excessive	
use	
of	
caffeine	CHEMICAL
or	
other	
stimulants	CHEMICAL
may	
raise	
risk	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE

Insomnia	DISEASE
in	
children	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
difficult	
temperament	
,	
as	
well	
as	
other	
comorbid	
medical	
and	
psychiatric	DISEASE
conditions	
.	

Unstable	
home

safety	
concerns	
and	
domestic	
abuse	
are	
likewise	
significant	
risk	
factors	
in	
both	
children	
and	
adults	
.	

Caregiver	
and	
relationship	
factors	
are	
also	
important	
to	
consider	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
parents	
of	
children	
with	
a	
current	
or	
past	
history	
of	
medical	
problems	
may	
have	
dif-	
ficulty	
setting	
limits	
,	
whether	
because	
of	
guilt	DISEASE
,	
a	
sense	
that	
the	
child	
is	
“	
vulnerable	
,	
”	
or	
concerns	
about	
doing	
psychological	
harm	
.	

Environmental	
factors	
such	
as	
the	
child	
sharing	
a	
room	
with	
a	
parent	
or	
with	
other	
siblings	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
extended	
family	
or	
others	
in	
the	
home	
,	
and	
cramped	
living	
accommodations	
may	
contribute	
to	
negative

Familial	
Patterns	

The	
familial	
pattern	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
not	
well	
documented	
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
the	
preva-	
lence	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
higher	
among	
monozygotic

relative	
to	
dizygotic

;	
it	
is	
also	
higher	
in

The	
association

Insomnia	DISEASE
Onset

Course

and	
Complications	
Onset	
may	
be	
insidious	DISEASE
or	
acute	
.	

In	
the	
former	
case	
,	
individuals	
often	
report	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
in	
early	
life	
or	
young	
adulthood	
.	

Onset	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
often	
associated	
with	
major	
life	
events	
(	
e.g.	
,	
separation	
,	
death	DISEASE
of	
a	
loved	
one	
)	
,	
minor	
daily	
stressors	
,	
or	
changes	
in	
sleep	
schedule	
.	

The	
course	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
can	
be	
situational	
,	
recurrent	
,	
or	
persistent	
.	

The	
specific	
type	
of	
sleep	
complaint	
may	
also	
change	
over	
time	
.	

Individuals	
who	
complain	
of	
diffi-	
culty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
one	
time	
may	
later	
complain	
of	
difficulty	
maintaining	
sleep	
,	
and	
vice	
versa	
.	

Although	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
often	
remits	
when	
the	
precipitating	
event	
subsides	
or	
the	
individual	
adapts	
to	
it	
,	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
may	
also	
persist	
over	
time	
even	
after	
the	
initial	
triggering	
factor	
has	
disappeared	
.	

When	
left	
untreated	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
persist	
and	
gradually	
lead	
to	
a	
vicious	
cycle	
of	
poor	
sleep	
,	
daytime	DISEASE
impairments	DISEASE
,	
apprehension	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
and	
further	
sleep	
disturbances	
.	

Among	
predisposed	
individ-	
uals	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
can	
also	
follow	
an	
intermittent	
course	
,	
with	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
associated	
with	
stressful	
life	
events	
.	

Even	
in	
persistent	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
there	
is	
extensive	
night

to	
-	
night	
variability	
,	
with	
an	
occasional	
good	
night	
’s	
sleep	
intertwined	
with	
several	
poor	
night	
’s	
sleep	
.	

Approximately	
70	
%	
of	
individuals	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
at	
a	
given	
time	
continue	
reporting	
insomnia	DISEASE
a	
year	
later	
,	
and	
50	
%	
still	
have	
insomnia	DISEASE
three	
years	
later	
.	

Complications	
of	
persistent	
insomnia	DISEASE
include	
increased	
risks	
for	
depression	DISEASE
,	
hypertension	DISEASE
,	
work	
disability	
,	
and	
prolonged	
use	
of	
prescription	
or	
over-	
the

counter	
sleep	
aids	
.	

Among	
children	
,	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
have	
its	
onset	
at	
any	
time	
during	
late	
infancy	
through	
the	
childhood	
years	
.	

The	
course	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
in	
young	
children	
varies	
and	
depends	
on	
the	
reasons	
for	
the	
sleeplessness	DISEASE
.	

When	
limit	
-	
setting	
factors	
and	
negative	
sleep	
associations	
resolve	
,	
sleep	
often	
improves	
.	

With	
age	
,	
inde-	
pendence	
and	
privacy	
become	
more	
important	
,	
and	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
may	
decrease	
.	

Complications	
may	
result	
from	
the	
consequent	
sleep	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
and	
include	
irritability	DISEASE
and	
decreased	
attention	
and	
school	
performance	
.	

Increased	
family	
tensions	
and	
caregiver	
sleep	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
may	
also	
result	
.	

Some	
who	
develop	
insomnia	DISEASE
during	
childhood	
may	
con-	
tinue	
to	
suffer	
from	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
into	
adulthood	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Developmental	
issues	
during	
childhood	
,	
such	
as	
separation	
anxiety	DISEASE
and	
age	
/	
develop-	
mental	
milestones	
,	
may	
predispose	
a	
child	
to	
developing	
sleep	
problems	
.	

For	
example	
,	
limit	
-	
setting	
issues	
are	
often	
more	
common	
after	
the	
child	
is	
old	
enough	
to	
climb	
out	
of	
the	
crib	
or	
is	
moved	
into	
a	
bed	
,	
has	
increased	
verbal	
skills	
,	
and	
desires	
greater	
indepen-	
dence	
.	

Because	
children	
are	
not	
expected	
to	
sleep	
through	
the	
night	
with	
regularity	
until	
they	
are	
three	
to	
six	
months	
of	
age	
,	
six	
months	
is	
a	
reasonable	
age	
to	
first	
consider	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
unless	
the	
sleeplessness	DISEASE
is	
very	
marked	
at	
an	
earlier	
age	
.	

However	
,	
when	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
are	
persistent	
and	
pronounced	
in	
infants	
,	
underlying	
medical	
causes	
should	
be	
considered	
(	
e.g.	
,	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
,	
GERD	DISEASE
,	
pain	DISEASE
)	
.	

The	
specific	
symptoms	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
as	
well	
as	
precipitating	
and	
per-	
petuating	
factors	
,	
may	
vary	
across	
the	
adult	
age	
range	
.	

These	
changes	
may	
in	
part	
reflect	
developmental	
changes	
across	
adulthood	
,	
such	
as	
the	
phase	
delay	
of	
endoge-	
nous	
circadian	
rhythms	
in	
adolescence	
and	
young	
adulthood	
,	
and	
the	
phase	
advance	
and	
increased	
number	
of	
awakenings	
often	
seen	
even	
among	
healthy	
older	
adults	
.	

Epidemiological	
studies	
confirm	
that	
sleep	
onset	
difficulties	
and	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
are	
most	
common	
among	
young	
adults	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
whereas	
sleep	
maintenance	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
early	
morning	
awakening	
are	
more	
common	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
and	
older	
adults	
.	

Objective	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
uncommon	
in	
younger	
adults	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
but	
more	
common	
in	
older	
adults	
.	

However	
,	
older	
adults	
may	
have	
less	
sleep	
dissatisfaction	
than	
their	
younger	
counterparts	
,	
despite	
objectively	
worse	
sleep	
continuity	
.	

Precipitating	
factors	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
also	
change	
across	
the	
adult	
age	
range	
,	
with	
medical	
and	
medication	
factors	
assuming	
a	
larger	
role	
in	
older	
adults	
.	

Likewise	
,	
perpetuating	
factors	
may	
vary	
with	
the	
life	
circumstances	
of	
adults	
of	
different	
ages	
.	

One	
common	
example	
is	
the	
option	
of	
older	
adults	
to	
spend	
large	
amounts	
of	
time	
in	
bed	
after	
retirement	
,	
which	
may	
exacerbate	
the	
effects	
of	
age	
on	
sleep	
continuity	
.	

Finally	
,	
medical	
disorders	
and	
symptoms	
(

a	
larger

in	
the

Hypnotic

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Studies	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
have	
focused	
on	
one	
or	
more	
dimensions	
of	
physiological	
hyperarousal	
during	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

These	
studies	
contrast	
groups	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
sufferers	
,	
typically	
those	
without	
sig-	
nificant	
comorbidities	
,	
with	
healthy	
controls	
using	
a	
variety	
of	
physiological	
mea-	
sures	
.	

Many	
of	
these	
studies	
are	
characterized	
by	
small	
sample	
sizes	
and	
lack	
of	
replication	
.	

Collectively	
these	
studies	
suggest	
increased	
physiological	
arousal	
among	
individuals	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
characterized	
by	
measures	
such	
as	
increased	
heart	
rate	
,	
altered	
heart	
rate	
variability	
,	
increased	
whole

body	
metabolic	
rate	
,	
elevated	
corti-	
sol	
,	
adrenocorticotropic	
hormone	
,	
and	
CRF	DISEASE
levels	
(	
particularly	
near	
sleep	
onset	
)	
,	
increased	
body	
temperature	
and	
increased	
high	
-	
frequency	
electroencephalographic	
(	
EEG	
)	
activity	
during	
nonrapid	
eye	
movement	
(	
NREM	
)	
sleep	
.	

These	
studies	
imply	
Insomnia	DISEASE
Insomnia	DISEASE
heightened	
activity	
of	
the	
sympathetic	
nervous	
system	
and	
hypothalamic	
-	
pitu-	
itary	
-	
adrenal	
axis	
across	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
that	
is	
thought	
to	
perpetuate	
sleep/	
wake	
dysfunction	
.	

Some	
evidence	
also	
suggests	
that	
physiological	
dysregulation	
may	
be	
more	
evident	
in	
certain	
subgroups	
of	
individuals	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
those	
with	
extreme	
subjective	
-	
objective	
sleep	
discrepancies	
or	
those	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
short	
objective	
sleep	
duration	
)	
.	

There	
is	
also	
some	
evidence	
that	
these	
findings	
may	
not	
generalize	
to	
insomnia	DISEASE
comorbid	DISEASE
with	
mental	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
which	
may	
have	
differ-	
ent	
pathophysiological	
findings	
.	

No	
discrete	
structural	
brain	
pathology	
can	
be	
identified	
in	
most	
individuals	
with	
insom-	
nia	
.	

Patients	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
comorbid	DISEASE
with	
neurological	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
brain	
trauma	DISEASE
,	
and	
multiple	DISEASE
sclerosis	DISEASE
may	
have	
identifiable	
brain	DISEASE
lesions	DISEASE
,	
but	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
rarely	
their	
sole	
neurological	
symptom	
.	

Recent	
studies	
have	
provided	
conflicting	
evi-	
dence	
regarding	
the	
finding	
of	
reduced	
hippocampal	
or	
anterior	
cingulate	
volume	
,	
with	
most	
studies	
reporting	
negative	
findings	
.	

Objective	
Findings	

Although	
polysomnography	
is	
not	
indicated	
in	
the	
routine	
evaluation	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
it	
may	
be	
useful	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
sleep	
-	
disordered	
breathing	
)	
among	
some	
patients	
who	
appear	
to	
meet	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

In	
the	
absence	
of	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
results	
of	
polysomnographic	
sleep	
monitoring	
of	
patients	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
show	
increased	
sleep	
latency	
and/or	
increased	
wake	
time	
after	
sleep	
onset	
coupled	
with	
reduced	
sleep	
efficiency	
in	
com-	
parison	
with	
age	
-	
appropriate	
norms	
.	

Sleep	
onset	
latency	
or	
wake	
time	
after	
sleep	
onset	
often	
exceeds	
30	
minutes	
,	
although	
one	
-	
hour	
to	
two	
-	
hour	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
in	
bed	
are	
not	
uncommon	
.	

A	
subset	
of	
patients	
shows	
reduced	
sleep	
duration	
of	
less	
than	
six	
hours	
per	
night	
.	

Some	
patients	
show	
altered	
sleep	
architecture	
with	
an	
increase	
in	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
and	
a	
decrease	
in	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

Patients	
with	
a	
pronounced	
condi-	
tioned	
sleep	
difficulty	
in	
the	
home	
environment	
may	
show	
a	
reverse	
first	
-	
night	
effect	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
(	
i.e.	
,	
better	
sleep	
on	
the	
first	
vs.	
the	
second	
recording	
night	
)	
.	

However	
,	
some	
patients	
show	
normal	
sleep	
times	
and	
an	
absence	
of	
sleep	
onset	
or	
sleep	DISEASE
maintenance	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
on	
standard	
polysomnographic	
(	
PSG	
)	
measures	
.	

Some	
insomnia	DISEASE
patients	
have	
alterations	
in	
power	
density	
measures	
of	
the	
sleep	
EEG	
when	
compared	
with	
individuals	
without	
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
.	

Specifically	
,	
these	
patients	
often	
show	
relatively	
greater	
power	
in	
the	
high	
frequency	
(	
beta	
and	
gamma	
ranges	
)	
band-	
widths	
.	

Some	
reports	
have	
shown	
that	
elevated	
high	
-	
frequency	
power	
is	
characteris-	
tic	DISEASE
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
patients	
with	
marked	
subjective	
-	
objective	
discrepancies	
in	
sleep	
mea-	
sures	
,	
compared	
to	
insomnia	DISEASE
patients	
with	
more	
obvious	
objective	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbances	DISEASE
or	
individuals	
without	
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
.	

Serial	
monitoring	
with	
PSG	
or	
actigraphy	
typically	
shows	
marked	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
vari-	
ability	
in	
all	
sleep	
measures	
as	
well	
as	
in	
recorded	
bed	
and	
rising	
times	
.	

This	
variability	
is	
typically	
greater	
than	
that	
of	
comparison	
groups	
of	
good	
sleepers	
.	

Many	
patients	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
underestimate	
the	
actual	
sleep	
time	
shown	
by	
polysom-	
nography	
,	
and	
some	
may	
provide	
sleep	
estimates	
that	
fall	
far	
short	
of	
actual	
PSG-	
recorded	
sleep	
time	
.	

This	
latter	
group	
has	
previously	
been	
categorized	
as	
having	
subjective	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
sleep	
state	
misperception	
,	
or	
paradoxical	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

In	
general	
,	
patients	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
tend	
to	
underestimate	
sleep	
duration	
and	
overestimate	
sleep	
latency	
and	
awakenings	
,	
whereas	
good	
sleepers	
tend	
to	
overestimate	
sleep	
duration	
and	
underestimate	
sleep	
latency	
and	
awakenings	
relative	
to	
PSG	
.	

This	
subjective	
-	
ob-	
jective	
mismatch	
may	
be	
related	
to	
physiological	
hyperarousal	
,	
and	
may	
be	
one	
of	
the	
core	
features	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Results	
of	
the	
Multiple	
Sleep	
Latency	
Test	
(	
MSLT	
)	
usually	
show	
normal	
daytime	
alert-	
ness	
.	

In	
several	
studies	
,	
patients	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
have	
longer	
mean	
MSLT	
values	
than	
control	
subjects	
,	
suggesting	
hyperalertness	DISEASE
or	
hyperarousal	
.	

A	
minority	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
patients	
,	
particularly	
older	
adults	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
have	
reduced	
mean	
MSLT	
values	
indicating	
increased	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Such	
a	
finding	
should	
prompt	
consideration	
of	
other	
concurrent	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
.	

Young	
children	
typically	
show	
essentially	
normal	
sleep	
during	
PSG	
monitoring	
when	
the	
caregiver	
is	
present	
and	
appropriate	
limits	
are	
set	
in	
the	
laboratory	
.	

Although	
PSG	
and	
MSLT	
testing	
usually	
are	
not	
helpful	
in	
the	
establishment	
of	
an	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
,	
there	
are	
circumstances	
that	
may	
warrant	
such	
testing	
with	
selected	
patients	
.	

PSG	
should	
be	
considered	
when	
there	
are	
reported	
symptoms	
or	
bed	
partner	
observations	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disordered	DISEASE
breathing	DISEASE
or	
periodic	
limb	
movements	
during	
sleep	
.	

Patients	
who	
present	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
accompanied	
by	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
warrant	
PSG	
and	
MSLT	
testing	
,	
particularly	
if	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
is	
suspected	
.	

Patients	
who	
show	
acceptable	
adherence	
to	
trials	
of	
well	
-	
established	
insom-	
nia	
therapies	
but	
fail	
to	
show	
adequate	
treatment	
response	
may	
benefit	
by	
PSG	
to	
rule	
out	
a	
comorbid	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Finally	
,	
a	
small	
number	
of	
functional	
imaging	
studies	
have	
been	
conducted	
during	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
in	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
control	
groups	
.	

These	
studies	
suggest	
region-	
ally	
specific	
increases	
of	
relative	
glucose	CHEMICAL
metabolism	
in	
insomnia	DISEASE
compared	
to	
controls	
.	

Specifically	
,	
these	
studies	
show	
smaller

of	
relative

in

patients	
.	

Self

reported	
and	
objective	
sleep	
disruptions	
are	
related	
to	
increased	
relative	
metabolism	
in	
these	
regions	
.	

These	
findings	
are	
similar	
to	
regional

Differential	
Diagnosis	
A	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
that	
presents	
as	
difficulty	
initiating	
sleep	
should	
be	
differen-	
tiated	
from	
delayed	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
.	

In	
the	
latter	
condition	
,	
sleep	
initiation	
is	
consistently	
later	
than	
desired	
because	
the	
individual	
’s	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
is	
delayed	
relative	
to	
the	
desired	
sleep	
schedule	
.	

Sleep	
-	
onset	
difficulties	
persist	
,	
and	
sleep	
time	
is	
reduced	
whenever	
the	
individual	
chooses	
bedtimes	
and	
rising	
times	
that	
are	
too	
early	
and	
out	
of	
phase	
with	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
.	

However	
,	
patients	
with	
delayed	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
are	
able	
to	
fall	
asleep	
with	
less	
difficulty	
,	
and	
sleep	
a	
normal	
amount	
of	
time	
,	
when	
sleeping	
in	
phase	
with	
their	
delayed	
endogenous	
rhythm	
by	
selecting	
late	
bed	
and	
rising	
times	
.	

By	
comparison	
,	
those	
with	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
often	
feel	
sleepy	
at	
the	
desired	
bedtime	
but	
are	
unable	
to	
sleep	
regardless	
of	
the	
timing	
of	
their	
bed	
and	
rise	
times	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
sleep	
problems	
tend	
to	
be	
more	
variable	
on	
a	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
basis	
in	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Given	
the	
prevalence	
of	
delayed	
sleep-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
in	
teenagers	
and	
young	
adults	
,	
it	
is	
particularly	
important	
to	
con-	
sider	
the	
possibility	
of	
this	
alternate	
or	
comorbid	
diagnosis	
when	
evaluating	
individuals	
from	
these	
age	
groups	
presenting	
with	
sleep	
onset	
insomnia	DISEASE
complaints	
.	

A	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
that	
presents	
as	
a	
difficulty	
maintaining	
sleep	
with	
pre-	
mature	
morning	
rise	
times	
also	
should	
be	
differentiated	
from	
advanced	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
.	

The	
latter	
tends	
to	
be	
more	
common	
in	
older	
adults	
than	
it	
is	
in	
younger	
adults	
and	
children	
.	

Among	
those	
with	
an	
advanced	
sleep	
phase	
pattern	
,	
sleep	
initia-	
tion	
is	
consistently	
earlier	
than	
desired	
because	
the	
individual	
’s	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
is	
advanced	
relative	
to	
the	
desired	
sleep	
schedule	
.	

However	
,	
total	
sleep	
time	
is	
adequate	
when	
the	
individual	
chooses	
early	
bed	
and	
rise	
times	
that	
coincide	
with	
the	
advanced	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
those	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
dis-	
order	
may	
display	
sleep	DISEASE
maintenance	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
and	
early	
morning	
rise	
time	
regard-	
less	
of	
the	
sleep	
schedule	
they	
select	
.	

There	
can	
be	
some	
overlap	
between	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
and	
both	
delayed	
and	
advanced	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorders	
.	

Patients	
with	
a	
delayed	
sleep	
pattern	
may	
become	
chronically	
frustrated	
or	
anxious	
about	
their	
inability	
to	
initiate	
sleep	
at	
their	
desired	
times	
,	
and	
this	
frustration	
or	
anxiety	DISEASE
may	
continue	
to	
disrupt	
sleep	
and	
delay	
sleep	
onset	
well	
beyond	
the	
sleep	
onset	
time	
promoted	
by	
the	
endogenous	
rhythm	
.	

Early	
morning	DISEASE
awakenings	DISEASE
may	
similarly	
have	
arousing	
sleep	
disruptive	
effects	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
an	
advanced	
sleep	
phase	
.	

In	
such	
circumstances	
both	
a	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep	
-	
wake	
disorder	
diagnosis	
and	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
may	
apply	
and	
should	
be	
assigned	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
also	
be	
discriminated	
from	
situational	
sleep	
dif-	
ficulties	
arising	
from	
sleep	
-	
disruptive	
environmental	
circumstances	
.	

A	
variety	
of	
environmental	
factors	
including	
excessive	
noise	
or	
light	
and	
extreme	
temperatures	
will	
disrupt	
the	
sleep	
of	
most	
individuals	
.	

Also	
,	
sleeping	
in	
an	
area	
where	
there	
is	
imminent	
threat	
or	
danger	
to	
one	
’s	
safety	
can	
also	
be	
disruptive	DISEASE
to	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
.	DISEASE

Bed	
part-	
ners	
who	
snore	
loudly	
,	
move	
excessively	
during	
sleep	
,	
or	
have	
parasomnias	DISEASE
may	
also	
disrupt	
one	
’s	
sleep	
.	

When	
an	
individual	
reports	
environmental	
circumstances	
that	
would	
be	
regarded	
as	
disruptive	DISEASE
to	
the	
sleep	
of	
most	
individuals	
,	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
not	
be	
assigned	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
applies	
only	
when	
the	
individual	
reports	
sleep	
difficulty	
in	
the	
context	
of	
sleep	
-	
conducive	
envi-	
ronment	
circumstances	
or	
when	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
show	
some	
independence	
from	
the	
environmental	
factors	
.	

When	
environmental	
circumstances	
are	
a	
primary	
cause	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
and	
associated	
consequences	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
be	
considered	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
also	
be	
differentiated	
from	
patterns	
of	
chronic	
voli-	
tional	
sleep	
restriction	
(	
insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
)	
.	

Some	
individuals	
show	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
fatigue	DISEASE
,	
and	
reduced	
sleep	
at	
night	
as	
a	
result	
of	
electing	
overly	
demanding	
daytime	
schedules	
or	
by	
volitionally	
delaying	
sleep	
in	
order	
to	
engage	
in	
desired	
recreational	
or	
social	
activities	
.	

However	
,	
when	
allowing	
themselves	
suffi-	
cient	
time	
to	
sleep	
,	
they	
are	
able	
to	
initiate	
and	
maintain	
sleep	
easily	
and	
for	
a	
normal	
duration	
.	

Those	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
tend	
to	
have	
excessive	
wake	
time	
and	
reduced	
sleep	
time	
despite	
routinely	
allotting	
sufficient	
time	
to	
sleep	
.	

Moreover	
,	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
not	
typically	
associated	
with	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepi-	
ness	
and	
unintentional	
daytime	
sleep	
episodes	
,	
which	
are	
often	
observed	
in	
those	
with	
patterns	
of	
volitional	
sleep	
restriction	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	DISEASE
may	
occur	
comorbid	DISEASE
with	
another	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
such	
as	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
or	
restless	DISEASE
legs	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
.	

A	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
would	
apply	
Insomnia	DISEASE
Insomnia	DISEASE
only	
when	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
show	
some	
independence	
in	
their	
onset	
or	
variation	
over	
time	
from	
the	
other	
symptoms	
of	
the	
co	
-	
occurring	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
;	
or	
(	
2	
)	
when	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
persist	
despite	
adequate	
treatment	
reflected	
by	
marked	
symptom	
improvement	
in	
the	
coincident	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

A	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
would	
not	
apply	
when	
effective	
treatment	
of	
the	
coincident	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
resolves	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
.	

Among	
children	
,	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
when	
the	
child	
has	
to	
sleep	
alone	
in	
a	
separate	
room	
,	
but	
absent	
when	
the	
child	
is	
allowed	
to	
sleep	
with	
parents	
or	
when	
a	
parent	
is	
present	
in	
the	
child	
’s	
bedroom	
.	

An	
absence	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
under	
the	
latter	
circumstances	
does	
not	
indicate	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
resolved	
.	

Only	
when	
the	
child	
is	
able	
to	
sleep	
consistently	
independently	
is	
there	
no	
longer	
an	
insomnia	DISEASE
problem	
.	

In	
some	
children	
,	
the	
persistence	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
in	
the	
absence	
of	
parents	
may	
reflect	
underlying	
conditions	
such	
as	
separation	
anxiety	DISEASE
or	
an	
anxiety	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

In	
young	
children	
,	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
can	
be	
the	
result	
of	
medical	
issues	
,	
including	
gas-	
troesophageal	
reflux	DISEASE
,	
as	
well	
as	
developmental	
milestones	
,	
such	
as	
motoric	
,	
language	
,	
and	
cognitive	
development	
.	

Children	
,	
adolescents	
,	
and	
adults	
may	
develop	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
comorbid	
with	
a	
medical	
or	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
symp-	
toms	
may	
arise	
as	
a	
result	
of	
either	
another	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
a	
medical	
condition	
,	
or	
a	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
that	
has	
sleep	
-	
disruptive	
effects	
.	

A	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
would	
apply	
when	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
show	
some	
independence	
in	
their	
onset	
or	
variation	
over	
time	
from	
the	
other	
symptoms	
of	
the	
co	
-	
occurring	
sleep	
,	
medical	
,	
or	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
;	
or	
(

when	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
persist	
despite	
ade-	
quate

reflected	
by	
marked	
symptom	
improvement	
in	
the	
coincident	
sleep	
,	
medical	
,	
or	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Because	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
often	
develop	
some	
independence	
over	
time	
,	
a	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
usually	
will	
be	
war-	
ranted	
when	
those	
symptoms	
are	
persistent	
in	
association	
with	
a	
chronic	
medical	
or	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

A	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
would	
not	
apply	
when	
effective	
treatment	
of	
the	
coincident

,	
medical	
,	
or

disorder	DISEASE
resolves	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Much	
remains	
to	
be	
learned	
about	
the	
underlying	
pathophysiological	
pathways	
leading	
to	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
whether	
insomnia	DISEASE
should	
be	
classified	
as	
a	
unitary	
disorder	
or	
sub-	
divided	
into	
several	
subtypes	
.	

Clearly	
,	
these	
issues	
are	
closely	
linked	
.	

Further	
studies	
that	
clarify	
the	
pathophysiological	
pathways	
leading	
to	
insomnia	DISEASE
ultimately	
will	
reveal	
whether	
those	
meeting	
current	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
suffer	
from	
a	
single	
disease	
or	
multiple	
separate	
diseases	
with	
similar	
outward	
presentations	
.	

A	
related	
unresolved	
issue	
is	
whether	
the	
current	
global	
classification	
promotes	
a	
generic	
approach	
to	
insomnia	DISEASE
therapy	
that	
ultimately	
fails	
to	
benefit	
some	
insomnia	DISEASE
subgroups	
.	

Perhaps	
this	
global	
classification	
scheme	
will	
overlook	
distinctive	
insomnia	DISEASE
subtypes	
with	
specific	
treatment	
needs	
that	
vary	
from	
the	
generic	
treatments	
typically	
provided	
.	

Previous	
editions	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
allowed	
for	
the	
assignment	
of	
an	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnosis	
to	
patients	
who	
present	
exclusively	
with	
com-	
plaints	
of	
nonrestorative	DISEASE
sleep	
;	
that	
is	
,	
patients	
who	
complain	
only	
of	
sleep	
that	
is	
poor	
in	
quality	
or	
unrefreshing	DISEASE
,	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
sleep	
-	
onset	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
,	
could	
qualify	
for	
an	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnosis	
in	
previous	
versions	
of	
this	
nosol-	
ogy	
.	

The	
current	
version	
of	
this	
nosology	
excludes	
such	
patients	
from	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnostic	
categories	
.	

This	
decision	
was	
based	
on	
several	
considerations	
.	

Most	
insom-	
nia	
patients	
present	
with	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
initiation	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
maintenance	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
.	

Although	
a	
small	
subset	
of	
patients	
present	
with	
isolated	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
nonrestorative	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
,	
this	
complaint	
more	
commonly	
arises	
in	
association	
with	
other	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
or	
in	
conjunction	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
disordered	DISEASE
breathing	DISEASE
,	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
or	
certain	
chronic	
medical	
conditions	
(	
e.g.	
,	
fibromyalgia	DISEASE
or	
chronic	DISEASE
fatigue	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
)	
.	

Although	
various	
epidemiological	
studies	
have	
identified	
subgroups	
who	
are	
presumed	
to	
have	
an	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
and	
present	
solely	
with	
a	
complaint	
that	
their	
sleep	
is	
non-	
restorative	
or	
unrefreshing	DISEASE
,	
such	
studies	
typically	
lack	
polysomnography	
that	
would	
be	
needed	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
occult	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
as	
a	
cause	
.	

Finally	
,	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
remains	
a	
poorly	
defined	
construct	
that	
may	
reflect	
not	
only	
a	
type	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
,	
but	
also	
the	
daytime	
consequences	
of	
poor	
sleep	
such	
as	
fatigue	DISEASE
and	
anergia	DISEASE
.	

This	
con-	
struct	
would	
benefit	
from	
further	
definitional	
efforts	
and	
research	
to	
explore	
its	
clinical	
significance	
in	
the	
context	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Given	
these	
considerations	
,	
the	
isolated	
com-	
plaint	
of	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
was	
not	
retained	
as	
part	
of	
the	
diagnostic	
definition	
of	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
delineated	
in	
this	
manual

Resistance	
going	
to	
bed	
on	
an	
appropriate	
schedule	
and	
difficulty	
sleeping	
without	
parent	
or	
caregiver	
intervention	
is	
seen	
most	
commonly	
in	
children	
and	
older	
adults	
who	
require	
the	
supervision	
of	
a	
caretaker	
due	
to	
a	
significant	
level	
of	
functional	
impairment	
(	
e.g.	
,	
those	
with	
dementia	DISEASE
)	
.	
.	

Patients	
with	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
complain	
of	
sleep/	DISEASE
wake	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
fewer	
than	
three	
times	
per	
week	
on	
average	
,	
yet	
have	
clinically	
significant	
concerns	
about	
their	
symptoms	
and	
warrant	
clinical	
attention	
.	
.	

Many	
conditions	
such	
as	
grief	
,	
acute	DISEASE
pain	DISEASE
,	
or	
other	
acute	
stressors	
are	
quite	
often	
associated	
with	
poor	
sleep	
.	

When	
such	
conditions	
are	
the	
sole	
cause	
of	
the	
sleep	
difficulty	
,	
a	
separate	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnosis	
may	
not	
apply	
.	

The	
primary	
factor	
in	
determining	
application	
of	
a	
short-	
term	
or	
adjustment	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnosis	
is	
the	
extent	
to	
which	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
becomes	
a	
significant	
focus	
for	
the	
individual	
and/or	
warrants	
independent	
clinical	
attention	
.	

Essential	
Features	
The	
essential	
feature	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
a	
short	
-	
term	
difficulty	
ini-	
tiating	
or	
maintaining	
sleep	
that	
results	
in	
general	
sleep	
dissatisfaction	
.	

The	
sleep	
complaint	
is	
accompanied	
by	
daytime	DISEASE
distress	DISEASE
about	
poor	
sleep	
or	
impairment	
in	
family	
,	
social	
,	
occupational	
,	
academic	
,	
or	
other	
important	
areas	
of	
functioning	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
and	
associated	
daytime	
symptoms	
occur	
despite	
having	
adequate	
time	
and	
circumstances	
each	
night	
to	
obtain	
necessary	
sleep	
.	

Short-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
can	
occur	
in	
isolation	
or	
comorbid	
with	
a	
mental	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
medical	
condition	
,	
or	
substance	
use	
.	

In	
many	
cases	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
lasting	
less	
than	
three	
months	
,	
there	
is	
an	
identifiable	
cause	
that	
serves	
as	
the	
precipitant	
.	

In	
other	
cases	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
occurs	
episodically	
,	
often	
coincident	
to	
daytime	DISEASE
stressors	DISEASE
that	
account	
for	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
that	
compose	
short-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
include	
difficulties	
initiating	
sleep	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
main-	
taining	
sleep	
.	

The	
latter	
complaint	
may	
include	
waking	
up	
during	
the	
night	
with	
difficulty	
returning	
to	
sleep	
or	
having	
a	
final	
awakening	
occurring	
too	
early	
,	
well	
before	
the	
desired	
rising	
time	
.	

Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
be	
character-	
ized	
solely	
by	
sleep	
onset	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
or	
,	
more	
commonly	
,	
by	
both	
types	
of	
complaints	
occurring	
together	
.	

Individuals	
’	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
may	
vary	
such	
that	
sleep	
onset	
difficulties	
are	
apparent	
on	
some	
nights	
,	
whereas	
sleep	DISEASE
maintenance	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
are	
present	
on	
other	
nights	
.	

Complaints	
about	
poor	
-	
quality	
,	
unrefreshing	DISEASE
,	
or	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
may	
accompany	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sleep	
mainte-	
nance	
complaints	
,	
but	
do	
not	
meet	
the	
definition	
of	
this	
condition	
when	
they	
occur	
in	
isolation	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
is	
the	
primary	
feature	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
but	
it	
is	
com-	
monly	
accompanied	
by	
waking	
symptoms	
similar	
to	
those	
seen	
in	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Specific	
symptoms	
such	
as	
fatigue	DISEASE
,	
impaired	
attention	
and	
concentration	
,	
poor	
memory	
,	
irritability	DISEASE
,	
and	
distress	
about	
poor	
sleep	
are	
common	
.	

When	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
arises	
in	
reaction	
to	
a	
stressful	
life	
event	
,	
such	
as	
the	
loss	
of	
a	
loved	
one	
,	
major	DISEASE
illness	DISEASE
,	
or	
divorce	
,	
the	
associated	
features	
may	
include	
anxiety	DISEASE
,	
worry	DISEASE
,	
ruminative	
thoughts	
,	
sadness	
,	
or	
depression	DISEASE
in	
relation	
to	
the	
specific	
stressor	
.	

If	
the	
individual	
uses	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
,	
illicit	
drugs	
,	
or	
medications	
for	
self	
-	
treatment	
,	
additional	
symptoms	
related	
to	
these	
substances	
may	
be	
seen	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
None

Demographics	
Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
can	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
.	

However	
,	
a	
short	
-	
term	
form	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
establish	
in	
infants	
because	
it	
is	
often	
difficult	
to	
link	
stressors	
to	
sleep	
disturbances	
in	
this	
age	
group	
.	

The	
exact	
prevalence	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
unknown	
.	

The	
one	
-	
year	
prevalence	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
dis-	
order	
among	
adults	
appears	
to	
be	
in	
the	
range	
of	
15	
%	
to	
20	
%	
.	

Like	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
more	
prevalent	
in	
women	
than	
in	
men	
,	
and	
in	
older	
age	
groups	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Affected	
individuals	
may	
note	
a	
lifelong	
tendency	
toward	
light	
sleep	
or	
diffi-	
culty	
sleeping	
during	
times	
of	
stress	
.	

A	
previous	
history	
of	
anxiety	DISEASE
or	
depressive	DISEASE
Insomnia	DISEASE
Insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
also	
may	
predispose	
an	
individual	
to	
develop	
a	
short-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

In	
children	
,	
having	
a	
parent	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
or	
living	
in	
a	
household	
lacking	
parental	
reinforcement	
of	
a	
consistent	
sleep	
/	
wake	
schedule	
may	
be	
predisposing	
factors	
.	

An	
acute	
,	
identifiable	
event	
or	
stressor	
usually	
precipitates	
this	
form	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Common	
precipitating	
events	
include	
changes	
or	
disputes	
in	
interpersonal	
relation-	
ships	
,	
occupational	
stress	
,	
personal	
losses	
,	
bereavement	
,	
diagnosis	
or	
onset	
of	
a	
new	
medical	
condition	
,	
visiting	
or	
moving	
to	
a	
new	
location	
,	
or	
physical	
changes	
to	
the	
usual	
sleep	
environment	
or	
schedule	
.	

Changes	
or	
stresses	
with	
a	
positive	
emotional	
tone	
also	
may	
serve	
as	
precipitating	
events	
.	

In	
children	
or	
dependent	
adults	
,	
such	
insomnia	DISEASE
can	
arise	
when	
the	
caretaker	
makes	
abrupt	
changes	
in	
the	
child	
’s	
or	
adult	
’s	
sleep	
routines	
or	
schedule	
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
environ-	
mental	
factors	
such	
as	
the	
child	
sharing	
a	
room	
with	
a	
parent	
or	
with	
other	
sib-	
lings	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
extended	
family	
or	
others	
in	
the	
home	
,	
and	
cramped	
living	
accommodations	
may	
contribute	
to	
negative	
sleep	
-	
onset	
associations	
or	
poor	
limit	
setting	
in	
children	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Familial	
patterns	
are	
less	
well	
documented	
for	
cases	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disor-	
der	DISEASE
than	
they	
are	
for	
individuals	
meeting	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
the	
familial	DISEASE
aggregation	DISEASE
found	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
is	
expected	
to	
also	
occur	
among	
individuals	
with	
more	
transient	
forms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Data	
support	
a	
greater	
genetic	
diathesis	DISEASE
to	
psychophysiologic	
arousal	
among	
certain	
individuals	
in	
response	
to	
stressors	
.	

This	
may	
,	
in	
turn	
,	
suggest	
a	
constitutional	
predisposition	
to	
short-	
term	
or	
adjustment	
insomnia	DISEASE
in	
such	
individuals	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Many	
individuals	
who	
develop	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
experience	
remission	
of	
their	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
over	
time	
.	

This	
occurs	
as	
distress	
over	
the	
precipitating	
event	
diminishes	
over	
time	
or	
in	
response	
to	
withdrawal	
of	
the	
stressor	
.	

However	
,	
a	
portion	
of	
those	
who	
initially	
experience	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
develop	
a	
more	
chronic	
form	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
subsequently	
meet	
criteria	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
dis-	
order	
.	

These	
individuals	
will	
then	
have	
the	
course	
and	
complications	
described	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
is	
the	
case	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
would	
not	
be	
considered	
until	
after	
a	
child	
reaches	
at	
least	
six	
months	
of	
age	
.	

The	
propensity	
to	
experience	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
in	
response	
to	
stress	
may	
dispose	
young	
and	
older	
individuals	
toward	
acute	
forms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
for	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
sleep	DISEASE
onset	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
are	
most	
common	
among	
young	
adults	
with	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
whereas	
sleep	
maintenance	
complaints	
and	
early	
morning	
awakening	
are	
more	
common	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
and	
older	
adults	
.	

Objective	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
uncommon	
in	
younger	
adults	
with	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
but	
is	
more	
common	
in	
older	
adults	
.	

Balancing	
job	
and	
family	
stressors	
may	
contribute	
to	
intermittent	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
problems	
in	
younger	
and	
middle	
-	
aged	
adults	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
older	
,	
retired	
adults	
may	
have	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
related	
to	
exacerbations	DISEASE
in	
comorbid	
chronic	
medical	
con-	
ditions	
or	
due	
to	
loss	
of	
loved	
ones	
that	
commonly	
occurs	
with	
advancing	
age	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Research	
on	
the	
pathology	
and	
pathophysiology	
of	
short	
-	
term	
variants	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
generally	
lacking	
because	
the	
majority	
of	
studies	
addressing	
this	
issue	
have	
focused	
on	
samples	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
shares	
many	
features	
with	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

The	
primary	
difference	
between	
the	
two	
conditions	
is	
that	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disor-	
der	DISEASE
does	
not	
meet	
the	
duration	
and	
frequency	
criteria	
required	
for	
the	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
diagnosis	
.	

Short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
also	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep	
-	
wake	
disorders	
resulting	
from	
rotating	
shift	
work	
or	
jet	
lag	
.	

In	
the	
latter	
case	
,	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
arises	
from	
a	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedule	
alteration	
that	
results	
in	
a	
mismatch	
between	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
and	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedule	
chosen	
—	
for	
example	
,	
having	
to	
sleep	
in	
the	
daytime	
rather	
than	
during	
the	
nighttime	
.	

In	
the	
case	
of	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
no	
such	
mismatch	
exists	
;	
yet	
,	
the	
individual	
demonstrates	
sleep	
onset	
or	
maintenance	
difficulties	
nonetheless

This	
diagnosis	
is	
reserved	
for	
individuals	
who	
complain	
of	
difficulty	DISEASE
initiating	
and	
maintaining	
sleep	
and	
yet	
do	
not	
meet	
the

criteria	
for	
either	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
dis-	
order	
or	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
this	
diagnosis	
may	
be	
assigned	
on	
a	
provisional	
basis	
when	
more	
information	
is	
needed	
to	
establish	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
or	
short	
-	
term	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

It	
is	
expected	
that	
this	
diag-	
nosis	
will	
be	
used	
sparingly	
,	
given	
its	
nonspecific	
nature	
.	

Isolated	
Symptoms	
and	
Normal	
Variants	
Excessive	
Time	
in	
Bed	

Some	
individuals	
may	
present	
with	
isolated	
insomnia	DISEASE
symptoms	
such	
as	
prolonged	
sleep	
latencies	
or	
long	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
during	
the	
night	
,	
yet	
not	
complain	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
nor	
show	
daytime	DISEASE
impairments	DISEASE
.	

In	
children	
,	
this	
pattern	
may	
emerge	
when	
parents	
or	
caregivers	
have	
unrealistic	
expectations	
for	
the	
child	
’s	
sleep	
needs	
and	
rou-	
tinely	
allot	
too	
much	
time	
for	
the	
child	
to	
be	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
this	
pattern	
is	
perhaps	
most	
common	
in	
noncomplaining	
groups	
who	
routinely	
allot	
significantly	
more	
time	
in	
bed	
than	
needed	
for	
sleep	
.	

For	
example	
,	
some	
individuals	
who	
are	
retired	
from	
work	
or	
not	
currently	
employed	
may	
routinely	
spend	
excessive	
time	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
and	
are	
not	
bothered	
by	
the	
expanded	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
they	
routinely	
experience	
.	

At	
present	
,	
epidemiological	
and	
laboratory	
studies	
are	
unable	
to	
ascertain	
whether	
adverse	
health	
outcomes	
are	
more	
strongly	
associated	
with	
perceived	
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
/	
dissatisfaction	
or	
with	
particular	
objective	
indices	
of	
sleep	
duration	
,	
sleep	
latency	
,	
and	
sleep	
continuity	
.	

Short	
Sleeper	
Some	
individuals	
routinely	
obtain	
less	
than	
six	
hours	
of	
sleep	
per	
night	
on	
average	
yet	
have	
no	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaints	
.	

Such	
individuals	
are	
considered	
to	
be	
normal	
short	
sleepers	
if	
they	
have	
no	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
difficulties	DISEASE
and	
show	
no	
obvious	
daytime	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
.	

Among	
these	
individuals	
,	
the	
observed	
relatively	
low	
average	
sleep	
time	
does	
not	
result	
from	
chronic	
volitional	
sleep	
restriction	
,	
as	
in	
the	
case	
of	
insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
but	
rather	
indicates	
a	
constitutional	
disposition	
for	
reduced	
sleep	
requirement	
.	

The	
clinical	
significance	
of	
chronic	
short	
sleep	
duration	
,	
and	
the	
identifi-	
cation	
of	
possible	
subtypes	
,	
remain	
open	
questions	
.	

Various	
studies	
have	
linked	
short	
sleep	
duration	
with	
metabolic	
,	
cardiovascular	
,	
and	
other	
forms	
of	
medical	
morbidity	
.	

However	
,	
these	
studies	
are	
typically	
unable	
to	
distinguish	
between	
individuals	
who	
have	
short	
sleep	
in	
the	
context	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
or	
another	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
those	
who	
are	
voluntarily	
restricting	
their	
sleep	
,	
and	
those	
who	
may	
have	
naturally	
short	
sleep	
.	

Short	
sleep	
resulting	
from	
different	
causes	
may	
have	
different	
pathophysiological	
signifi-	
cance	
.	

At	
present	
,	
those	
who	
demonstrate	
less	
than	
six	
hours	
of	
sleep	
per	
night	
should	
not	
be	
assigned	
an	
insomnia	DISEASE
diagnosis	
unless	
they	
also	
meet	
the	
criteria	
for	
one	
of	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
subtypes	
described	
herein

disorders	DISEASE
are	
characterized	
by	
abnormalities	
of

during

In	
some	
of	
these	
disorders	
,	
respiration	
is	
also	
abnormal	
during	
wakefulness

The	
disorders	
are

However	
,	
many	
patients	
will	
meet	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
more	
than	
one	
of	
these	
groups	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
many	
patients	
have	
a	
combination	
of	
obstruc-	
tive	DISEASE
and	
central	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
.	

Although	
a	
diagnosis	
is	
often	
based	
on	
which	
disorder	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
predominates	
,	
this	
may	
vary	
from	
night	
to	
night	
as	
well	
as	
over	
time	
in	
individual	
patients	
.	

There	
is	
also	
overlap	
in	
pathophysiology	
,	
as	
some	
central	
apneas	
are	
associ-	
ated	CHEMICAL
with	
a	
closed	
upper	
airway	
and	
many	
obstructive	
apneas	
begin	
during	
a	
time	
of	
falling

drive

In	
the	
sections	
that	
follow	
,	
individual	
respiratory	
events	
(	
e.g.	
,	
apneas	
,	
hypopneas	DISEASE
,	
and	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
)	
are	
not	
defined	
;	
rather	
,	
reference	
is	
made	
to

The	
AASM	
Manual	
for

includes	
different	
scoring

,	
and	
rules	
for

and	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

The	
OSA	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
are	
separated	
into	
adult	
and	
pediatric	
categories	
,	
as	
the	
presenta-	
tion	
,	
diagnostic	
criteria	
,	
course	
,	
and	
complications	
differ	
significantly	
.	

These	
disorders	
are	
characterized	
by	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
or	
closure	
during	
sleep	
while	
respiratory	
effort	
continues	
(	
at	
least	
during	
some	
portion	
of	
the	
event	
)

usually	
recorded	
)	
is	
now	
included	
in	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
adult	
OSA	DISEASE

The	
central

syndromes	DISEASE
are	
characterized	
by	
reduction	
or	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
due	
to	
absent

reduced	
respiratory	
effort	
.	

Central	
apnea	DISEASE

hypopnea	DISEASE
may	
occur	
in	
a	
cyclical	
or	
intermittent	
fashion	
.	

Patients	
with	
central

of	
various	
etiologies	
may	
also	
exhibit	
OSA	DISEASE

In	
primary

the

Patients

the

In	
this	
edition	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
there	
are	
a	
number	
of	
changes	
in	
the	
classification	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

The	
obesity	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
listed	
as	
a	
separate	
disorder	
given	
that	
it	
is	
both	
prevalent	
and	
has	
distinct	
clinical	
characteristics	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
other	
sleep	
related	
hypoventila-	
tion	
disorders	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
obesity	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
requires	
documenta-	
tion	
of	
awake	
(	
daytime	
)	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
(	
PaCO2	
>	
45	
mm	
Hg	
)	
.	

For	
the	
other	
disorders	
in	
this	
category	
,	
awake	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
may	
or	
may	
not	
be	
present	
.	

In	
the	
previous	
version	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
a	
group	
of	
disorders	
were	
listed	
under	
the	
category	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
/	
hypoxemia	
disorders	
.	

In	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
,	
disorders	
manifesting	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
are	
separated	
from	
disorders	
in	
which	
only	
a	
finding	
of	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
(	
arterial	
oxygen	
desaturation	
)	
during	
sleep	
is	
documented	
.	

Demonstrating	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
rather	
than	
simply	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
has	
important	
diagnostic	
and	
treatment	
consequences	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
are	
characterized	
by	
sustained	
periods	
of	
significantly	
reduced	
oxyhemoglobin	
saturation	
during	
sleep	
.	

This	
diagnostic	
category	
is	
used	
when	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
either	
not	
present	
or	
the	
status	
is	
unknown	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
can	
occur	
due	
to	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
,	
ven-

these	
factors	
.	

Many	
diverse	
etiologies	
can	
be	
associated	
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

There	
are	
no	
longer	
separate	
diagnostic	
categories	
for	
the	
various	
types	
of	
medical	
and	
neurological	
pathology	
that	
may	
contribute	
to	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
or	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.

The	
term	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
resistance	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
(	
UARS	DISEASE
)	
is	
subsumed	
under	
this	
diagnosis	
because	
the	
pathophysiology	
does	
not	
significantly	
differ	
from	
that	
of	
obstructive	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
.	

Use	
of	
the	
term	
Pickwickian	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
discouraged	
because	
not	
only	
has	
it	
been	
applied	
to	
those	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
but	
also	
indiscriminately	
used	
to	
describe	
persons	
who	
are	
only	
obese	
and	
those	
with	
obesity	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE

Notes

OCST	
commonly	
underestimates	
the	
number	
of	
obstructive	
respiratory	
events	
per	
hour	
as	
compared	
to	
PSG	
because	
actual	
sleep	
time	
,	
as	
determined	
primarily	
by	
EEG	
,	
is	
often	
not	
recorded	
.	

The	
term	
respiratory	
event	
index	
(	
REI	
)	
may	
be	
used	
to	
denote	
event	
frequency	
based	
on	
monitoring	
time	
rather	
than	
total	
sleep	
time	
.	
.	

Respiratory	
events	
defined	
according	
the	
most	
recent	
version	
of	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated	
Events	
.	
.	

RERAs	
and	
hypopnea	DISEASE
events	
based	
on	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
sleep	
can	
not	
be	
scored	
using	
OCST	
because	
arousals	DISEASE
by	
EEG	
criteria	
can	
not	
be	
identified	
.	

Essential	
Features	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
repetitive	
episodes	
of	
complete	
(	
apnea	DISEASE
)	
or	
partial	
(	
hypopnea	
)	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
occurring	
during	
sleep	
.	

These	
events	
often	
result	
in	
reduc-	
tions	
in	
blood	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
and	
are	
usually	
terminated	
by	
brief	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
sleep	
.	

By	
definition	
,	
apneic	
and	
hypopneic	DISEASE
events	
last	
a	
minimum	
of	
10	
seconds	
.	

Most	
events	
are	
10	
to	
30	
seconds	
in	
duration	
but	
occasionally	
persist	
for	
one	
minute	
or	
longer	
.	

Events	
can	
occur	
in	
any	
stage	
of	
sleep	
but	
more	
frequently	
occur	
in	
stages	
N1	
,	
N2	
,	
and	
R	
sleep	
than	
in	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

Events	
are	
usually	
longer	
and	
associated	
with	
more	
severe	
decreases	
in	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
when	
they	
occur	
in	
stage	
R	
sleep	
and	
when	
the	
individual	
is	
sleeping	
supine	
.	

Oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
usually	
returns	
to	
baseline	
values	
following	
resumption	
of	
normal	
breathing	
but	
may	
remain	
low	
if	
the	
apneic	
or	
hypopneic	DISEASE
events	
are	
very	
frequent	
and	
prolonged	
,	
or	
if	
there	
is	
underlying	
pulmonary	
pathology	
.	

Snoring	DISEASE
between	
apneas	DISEASE
is	
typically	
reported	
by	
bed	
partners	
,	
as	
are	
wit-	
nessed	
episodes	
of	
gasping	
or	
choking	DISEASE
and	
body	
movements	
that	
disrupt	
sleep	
.	

Most	
patients	
awaken	
in	
the	
morning	
feeling	
tired	
and	
unrefreshed	
regardless	
of	
the	
duration	
of	
their	
time	
in	
bed	
.	

Apneas	DISEASE
,	
hypopneas	DISEASE
,	
and	
snoring	DISEASE
may	
be	
exacerbated	
following	
the	
ingestion	
of	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
,	
use	
of	
sedating	
medications	
prior	
to	
sleep	
,	
or	
following	
an	
increase	
in	
body	
weight	
.	

Excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
a	
major	
presenting	
complaint	DISEASE
in	
many	
but	
not	
all	
cases	
.	

The	
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
most	
evident	
during	
relaxing	
or	
inactive	
situations	
.	

With	
extreme	
sleepi-	
ness	
,	
sleep	
may	
occur	
while	
actively	
conversing	
,	
eating	
,	
walking	
,	
or	
driving	
.	

In	
women	
,	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
a	
less	
prominent	
complaint	
.	

Additionally	
,	
reports	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
poor	
sleep	
quality	
,	
and	
fatigue	DISEASE
are	
common	
,	
particularly	
among	
women	
.	

Quality	
of	
life	
generally	
is	
adversely	
affected	
by	
unrefreshing	
sleep	
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
and	
fatigue	DISEASE
.	

Bed	
part-	
ners	
may	
also	
report	
sleep	
disruption	
and	
associated	
consequences	
.	

The	
frequency	
of	
apneas	DISEASE
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
correlates	
poorly	
with	
daytime	
symptom	
severity	
and	
impact	
on	
quality	
of	
life	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
affected	
individuals	
will	
not	
endorse	
any	
symptoms	
or	
confirm	
any	
bed	
partner	
observations	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Systemic	
hypertension	DISEASE
is	
a	
common	
finding	
in	
patients	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

There	
is	
substan-	
tial	
clinical	
and	
epidemiologic	
evidence	
implicating	
OSA	DISEASE
as	
a	
significant	
risk	
factor	
for	
development	
of	
systemic	
hypertension	DISEASE
independent	
of	
other	
conditions	
such	
as	
obesity	DISEASE
and	
smoking	
.	

Additionally	
,	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
frequently	
observed	
in	
patients	
with	
cor-	DISEASE
onary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
atrial	DISEASE
fibrillation	DISEASE
,	
and	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
and	
it	
may	
be	
an	
independent	
risk	
factor	
for	
these	
conditions	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
is	
also	
associated	
with	
type	
2	
diabetes	DISEASE
,	
and	
there	
are	
accumulating	
data	
to	
suggest	
that	
it	
is	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
type	
2	
diabetes	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
severe	
disease	
may	
be	
at	
risk	
for	
developing	
pulmo-	DISEASE
nary	
hypertension	DISEASE
and	
cor	DISEASE
pulmonale	DISEASE
,	
although	
this	
is	
usually	
seen	
only	
in	
patients	
with	
daytime	DISEASE
hypercapnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
comorbid	
conditions	
such	
as	
morbid	DISEASE
obesity	DISEASE
or	
chronic	DISEASE
obstructive	DISEASE
pulmonary	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
(	
COPD	DISEASE
)	
.	

When	
OSA	DISEASE
coexists	
with	
dilated	DISEASE
cardiomyopathy	DISEASE
or	
ischemic	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
there	
may	
be	
worsening	
of	
the	
underly-	
ing	
heart	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
and	
predisposition	
to	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

Gastroesophageal	DISEASE
reflux	DISEASE
symptoms	DISEASE
,	
nocturia	DISEASE
,	
mood	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
,	
and	
erectile	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
are	
some-	
times	
reported	
in	
patients	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

The	
disorder	
can	
also	
be	
associated	
with	
the	
following	
motor	
parasomnias	DISEASE
:	
OSA	DISEASE
-	
induced	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
non	
-	
rapid

attacks	
with	
prominent

.	

Severity	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
as	
determined	
by	
the	
frequency	
of	
apneas	DISEASE
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
and/or	
degree	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
correlates	
poorly	
with	
symptomatic	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Different	
measures	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
including	
self	
-	
reported	
severity	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
commonly	
used	
indices	
such	
as	
the	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
,	
and	
objective	
measures	
such	
as	
the	
Multiple	
Sleep	
Latency	
Test	
(	
MSLT	
)	
,	
are	
not	
strongly	
correlated	
and	
,	
thus	
,	
assessment	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
can	
be	
difficult	
and	
relatively	
unreliable	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
patients	
may	
adapt	
to	
any	
level	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
over	
time	
and	
fail	
to	
view	
it	
as	
a	
reportable	
problem	
.	

Bed

breathing	
pauses	
and	
disruptive	DISEASE
snoring	DISEASE
may	
not	
always	
be	
accompa-	
nied	
by	
patient	
complaints	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Finally	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
note	
that	
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
a	
condition	
with	
a	
number	
of	
possible	
etiologies	DISEASE
and	
a	
range	
of	
manifestations

Sleep

Subtypes	
Apneas	
and

are	
believed	
to	
have	
similar	
pathophysiology	
and	
consequences	
.	

Therefore	
,	
from	
a	
clinical	
perspective	
,	
there	
is	
little	
importance	
in	
distinguishing	
patients

demonstrate	
only	
REM	
-	
related	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	DISEASE
,	
but	
there	
is	
no	
consensus	
to	
suggest	
that	
this	
is	
a	
distinct	
clinical	
or	
pathophysiological	
subtype	
.	

Some	
patients	
have	
relatively	
few	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturations	
but	
a	
significant	
number	
of	
respiratory	
events	
characterized	
by	
narrowing	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
result-	
ing	
in	
brief	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
sleep	
.	

Depending	
on	
the	
definition	
of	
hypopnea	DISEASE
employed	
,	
these	
events	
typically	
meet	
criteria	
for	
either	
hypopneas	DISEASE
associated	
with	
arousal	
but	
no	
desaturation	
,	
or	
for	
RERAs	
.	

When	
initially	
described	
,	
this	
latter	
group	
was	
said	
to	
have	
UARS	DISEASE
.	

Current	
data	
suggest	
that	
this	
condition	
represents	
simply	
a	
variant	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
in	
which	
obstructive	DISEASE
events	
result	
in	
arousal	
but	
minimal	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
.	

Patients	
with	
this	
condition	
commonly	
snore	
and	
report	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
or	
fatigue	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
there	
are	
some	
reports	
of	
patients	
with	
frequent	
respiratory	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
in	
the	
absence	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
.	

They	
tend	
to	
be	
less	
obese	
than	
individuals	
who	
have	
respiratory	
event	
-	
associated	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
this	
group	
of	
patients	
is	
unknown	
.	

When	
advanced	
technology	
is	
used	
to	
detect	
changes	
in	
airflow	
(	
as	
described	
in	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated	
Events	
)	
,	
most	
of	
these	
patients	
will	
be	
diagnosed	
as	
having	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
as	
defined	
by	
the	
criteria	
listed	
above	
.	

COPD	DISEASE
and	
OSA	DISEASE
frequently	
coexist	
,	
but	
there	
is	
no	
common	
pathophysiologic	
rela-	
tionship	
.	

Nevertheless	
,	
individuals	
with	
both	
disorders	
have	
greater	
nocturnal	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
and	
daytime	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
for	
the	
same	
degree	
of	
bronchial	
airflow	
obstruc-	
tion	
,	
and	
greater	
risk	
of	
developing	
pulmonary	DISEASE
hypertension	DISEASE
and	
right	
heart	
failure	
.	

The	
prevalence	
rate	
for	
having	
both	
conditions	
has	
been	
estimated	
to	
be	
1	
%	
.	

Demographics	
OSA	DISEASE
can	
occur	
in	
any	
age	
group	
.	

Estimates	
of	
prevalence	
are	
very	
dependent	
on	
how	
sleep	
related	
respiratory	
events	
are	
defined	
,	
as	
well	
as	
their	
frequency	
and	
other	
criteria	
used	
to	
define	
disease	
.	

Nevertheless	
,	
general	
population	
-	
based	
studies	
from	
a	
number	
of	
countries	
indicate	
that	
OSA	DISEASE
associated	
with	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
occurs	
in	
3	
%	
to	
7	
%	
of	
adult	
men	
and	
2	
%	
to	
5	
%	
of	
adult	
women	
.	

However	
,	
because	
many	
individuals	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
do	
not	
endorse	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
the	
prevalence	
of	
the	
disease	
is	
likely	
much	
higher	
.	

A	
major	
study	
yielded	
prevalence	
rates	
as	
high	
as	
24	
%	
in	
men	
and	
9	
%	
in	
women	
using	
only	
an	
apnea	DISEASE
-	
hypopnea	DISEASE
index	
(	
AHI	
)	
criterion	
of	
≥	
5	
/	
hour	
,	
although	
addition	
of	
a	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
criterion	
reduced	
these	
estimates	
to	
4	
%	
in	
males	
and	
2	
%	
in	
females	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
increases	
with	
age	
,	
although	
it	
appears	
to	
plateau	
in	
the	
elderly	
.	

The	
ratio	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
in	
men	
compared	
to	
women	
is	
approximately	
two	
to	
one	
.	

This	
dispar-	
ity	
may	
decline	
in	
middle	
to	
older	
age	
as	
a	
result	
of	
a	
greater	
risk	
for	
OSA	DISEASE
in	
women	
after	
menopause	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
occurs	
in	
all	
racial	
and	
ethnic	
groups	
.	

In	
younger	
and	
elderly	
groups	
,	
but	
not	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
groups	
,	
OSA	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
more	
prevalent	
in	
blacks	
than	
whites	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
in	
Asian	
patients	
is	
comparable	
to	
that	
of	
whites	
,	
despite	
having	
a	
generally	
lower	
body	
mass	
index	
(	
BMI	
)	
.	

Differences	
in	
craniofacial	
features	
that	
predispose	
Asians	
to	
developing	
OSA	DISEASE
are	
the	
likely	
explanation	
.	

Data	
comparing	
OSA	DISEASE
prevalence	
rates	
among	
Hispanics	
and	
Native	
Americans	
to	
other	
racial	
/	
ethnic	
groups	
are	
sparse	
,	
although	
it	
is	
clear	
that	
OSA	DISEASE
occurs	
commonly	
in	
these	
groups	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	

The	
major	
predisposing	
factor	
for	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
excess	
body	
weight	
.	

It	
has	
been	
estimated	
that	
~60	
%	
of	
moderate	
to	
severe	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
attributable	
to	
obesity	DISEASE
.	

The	
risk	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
increases	
as	
the	
degree	
of	
additional	
weight	
increases	
,	
with	
an	
extremely	
high	
preva-	
lence	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
in	
people	
with	
morbid	DISEASE
obesity	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE
patients	
with	
normal	
or	
below	
-	
nor-	
mal	
body	
weight	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
have	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
localized	
structural	
abnormality	
such	
as	
a	
maxillomandibular	DISEASE
malformation	DISEASE
or	
adenotonsillar	DISEASE
enlargement	DISEASE
.	

Increasing	
neck	
circumference	
predicts	
higher	
AHIs	DISEASE
;	
it	
is	
not	
,	
however	
,	
independent	
of	
BMI	
.	

Instability	
in	
ventilatory	
control	
appears	
to	
increase	
risk	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Those	
patients	
with	
an	
exaggerated	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
a	
respiratory	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
have	
a	
greater	
propensity	
for	
obstructive	
events	
.	

Menopause	
is	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
this	
disorder	
in	
women	
,	
even	
after	
adjustment	
for	
age	
and	
BMI	
.	

However	
,	
use	
of	
hormone	
replacement	
therapy	
may	
be	
protective	
.	

There	
are	
conflicting	
data	
concerning	
smoking	
as	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Various	
abnormalities	
of	
the	
bony	
and	
soft	
tissue	
structures	
of	
the	
head	
and	
neck	
may	
predispose	
the	
individual	
to	
having	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

These	
may	
be	
hereditary	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
mandibular	
size	
,	
mandibular	
position	
,	
palatal	
height	
)	
or	
acquired	
(	
e.g.	
,	
enlarged	
adenoids	
and	
tonsils	
)	
.	

Endocrine	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
acromegaly	DISEASE
and	
hypothy-	
roidism	
are	
risk	
factors	
for	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Adults	
and	
children	
with	
Down	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
also	
have	
a	
high	
prevalence	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE
is	
common	
in	
patients	
with	
some	
neurologic	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
that	
affect	
peripheral	
muscles	
,	
such	
as	
myotonic	DISEASE
dystrophy	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE
is	
likely	
made	
worse	
following	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
consumption	
or	
use	
of	
sedating	
medications	
before	
sleep	
and	
by	
nocturnal	
nasal	
restriction	
or	
congestion	DISEASE
due	
to	
abnormal	
morphology	
,	
rhinitis	DISEASE
,	
or	
both	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
a	
heritable	
condition	
as	
demonstrated	
by	
familial	
clustering	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
patients	
.	

First	
-	
degree	
relatives	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
patients	
are	
twice	
as	
likely	
to	
have	
OSA	DISEASE
in	
comparison	
Sleep

to	
those

.	

Clustering	
of	
symptoms	
that	
are	
associated	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
such	
as	
snoring	DISEASE
,	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
and	
snorting	
or	
gasping	
also	
occurs	
.	

Heritability	
explains	
approximately	
one	
third	
of	
the	
variation	
in	
the	
AHI	
,	
with	
a	
substantial	
proportion	
of	
the	
heritability	
explained	
by	
obesity	DISEASE
.	

Other	
inherited	DISEASE
traits	DISEASE
that	
might	
predispose	
an	
indi-	
vidual	
to	
developing	
OSA	DISEASE
include	
craniofacial	
morphology	
and	
ventilatory	
control	
.	

Familial	
environmental	
factors	
such	
as	
physical	
activity	
and	
eating	
habits	
may	
play	
a	
role	
as	
well	
.	

Nevertheless	
,	
genetic	
studies	
to	
date	
have	
not	
identified	
a	
unique	
gene	
or	
genes	
responsible	
for	
OSA	DISEASE
heritability	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
As	
documented	
in	
longitudinal	
population	
studies	
,	
the	
severity	
of	
untreated	
OSA	DISEASE
mea-	
sured	
by	
the	
AHI	
tends	
to	
slowly	
progress	
over	
time	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
becomes	
more	
severe	
in	
patients	
whose	
BMI	
increases	
,	
but	
may	
improve	
with	
weight	
reduction	
.	

However	
,	
the	
effect	
of	
weight	DISEASE
gain	DISEASE
on	
increasing	
OSA	DISEASE
severity	
is	
greater	
than	
the	
impact	
of	
weight	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
on	
decreasing	
OSA	DISEASE
severity	
.	

Moreover	
,	
the	
consequences	
of	
weight	
change	
are	
more	
evident	
in	
men	
than	
women	
.	

Substantial	
evidence	
implicates	
OSA	DISEASE
as	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
incident	
systemic	
hyper-	
tension	
,	
coronary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
and	
premature	
mortality	
.	

Data	
suggest	
that	
these	
effects	
are	
more	
evident	
in	
men	
and	
middle	
-	
aged	
individuals	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
there	
is	
accumulating	
evidence	
to	
suggest	
that	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
type	DISEASE
2	DISEASE
diabetes	DISEASE
mellitus	DISEASE
independent	
of	
obesity	DISEASE
.	

Various	
arrhythmias	DISEASE
are	
commonly	
observed	
in	
association	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Evidence	
suggests	
that	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
particularly	
related	
to	
the	
onset	
and	
recurrence	
of	
atrial	DISEASE
fibrillation	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE
may	
increase	
the	
severity	
of	
depression	DISEASE
.	

Because	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
func-	
tional	
impairment	
occurs	
commonly	
as	
manifested	
by	
poor	
job	
performance	
,	
loss	
of	
employment	
,	
impaired	
family	
relationships	
,	
and	
reduction	
in	
overall	
quality	
of	
life	
.	

The	
risk	
of	
motor	
vehicle	
accidents	DISEASE
is	
significantly	
increased	
among	
those	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
OSA	DISEASE
can	
occur	
in	
any	
age	
group	
,	
but	
in	
adults	
,	
prevalence	
accelerates	
between	
young	
adulthood	
and	
middle	
age	
,	
with	
a	
plateau	
reached	
after	
approximately	
age	
65	
years	
.	

Although	
OSA	DISEASE
occurs	
in	
the	
elderly	
,	
it	
is	
commonly	
observed	
with	
few	
symptoms	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
some	
evidence	
suggests	
that	
risk	
of	
cardiovascular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
related	
to	
OSA	DISEASE
may	
be	
less	
important	
in	
the	
elderly	
.	

This	
has	
raised	
the	
possibility	
that	
its	
presence	
in	
this	
age	
group	
represents	
a	
distinct	
clinical	
variant	
.	

Pediatric	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
discussed	
in	
a	
separate	
section	
(	
below	
)	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
underlying	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
during	
sleep	
is	
multifactorial	
.	

Patients	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
commonly	
have	
reduced	
cross	
-	
sectional	
area	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
lumen	
due	
to	
either	
excessive	
bulk	
of	
soft	
tissues	
(	
tongue	
,	
soft	
palate	DISEASE
,	
and	
lateral	
pha-	
ryngeal	
walls	
)	
or	
craniofacial	
anatomy	
,	
or	
both	
.	

During	
inspiration	
,	
negative	
pressure	
is	
generated	
in	
the	
lumen	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
,	
promoting	
closure	
.	

However	
,	
pharyngeal	
dilating	
muscles	
act	
to	
maintain	
patency	
.	

The	
activity	
of	
these	
muscles	
decreases	
with	
sleep	
onset	
,	
but	
is	
normally	
adequate	
to	
maintain	
an	
open	
airway	
.	

In	
persons	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
the	
activity	
of	
the	
pharyngeal	
dilating	
muscles	
becomes	
insufficient	
to	
prevent	
narrow-	
ing	
and/or	
closure	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
.	

This	
state	
-	
dependent	
change	
is	
the	
major	
con-	
tributing	
factor	
leading	
to	
an	
obstructed	
upper	
airway	
.	

There	
is	
a	
further	
reduction	
in	
tone	
and	
phasic	
activity	
of	
pharyngeal	
dilating	
muscles	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
particularly	
in	
phasic	
REM	
,	
which	
likely	
contributes	
to	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
that	
are	
longer	
and	
more	
pronounced	
.	

Decreased	
end	
-	
expiratory	
lung	
volume	
and	
falling	
ventilatory	
drive	
associated	
with	
hypocapnia	DISEASE
also	
predispose	
to	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
or	
closure	
.	

In	
the	
breaths	
leading	
up	
to	
obstructive	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
,	
end	
-	
expiratory	
upper	
airway	
caliber	
pro-	

gressively	
decreases	
.	

Smaller	
end	
-	
expiratory	
lung	
volume	
may	
result	
in	
smaller	
upper	
airway	
size	
due	
to	
decreased	
downward	
traction	
(	
tracheal	
tug	
)	
.	

Some	
patients	
have	
unstable	
ventilatory	
control	
(	
high	
loop	DISEASE
gain	DISEASE
)	
with	
resulting	
periods	
of	
hypocapnia	DISEASE
that	
may	
also	
contribute	
to	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
.	

The	
mechanisms	
of	
apnea	DISEASE
/	
hypopnea	DISEASE
termination	
are	
controversial	
.	

Event	
termination	
may	
occur	
with	
or	
without	
an	
associated	
arousal	
.	

Some	
events	
may	
resolve	
with	
aug-	
mentation	
of	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
from	
chemical	
(	
low	
PaO2	
,	
high	
PaCO2	
)	
and	
mechanical	
(	
upper	
airway	
mechanoreceptors	
)	
stimuli	
,	
whereas	
others	
may	
depend	
on	
a	
change	
of	
sleep	
state	
(	
arousal	
)	
at	
either	
a	
cortical	
or	
subcortical	
level	
.	

Cortical	
arous-	
als	
are	
associated	
with	
changes	
detectable	
by	
EEG	
,	
whereas	
other	
changes	
of	
state	
may	
be	
detectable	
only	
by	
direct	
or	
indirect	
measures	
of	
sympathetic	
tone	
.	

Even	
if	
arousals	DISEASE
are	
not	
required	
for	
termination	
of	
all	
obstructive	DISEASE
events	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
fragmentation	DISEASE
from	
arousals	DISEASE
is	
nevertheless	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
significant	
cause	
of	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Apneas	DISEASE
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
typically	
last	
considerably	
longer	
in	
REM	
and	
,	
in	
some	
patients	
,	
are	
only	
present	
in	
this	
sleep	
stage	
.	

The	
explanation	
for	
this	
finding	
is	
unknown	
.	

As	
an	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
hypopnea	DISEASE
event	
progresses	
,	
the	
patient	
gradually	
becomes	
more	
hypox-	
emic	
;	
the	
degree	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
is	
dependent	
not	
only	
on	
the	
duration	
of	
the	
event	
,	
but	
also	
on	
the	
patient	
’s	
baseline	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
and	
lung	
volume	
and	
the	
presence	
of	
comorbid	
lung	
conditions	
.	

Slight	
hypercarbia	DISEASE
also	
occurs	
during	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
and	
is	
worse	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.

Accumulating	
evidence	
indicates	
that	
persons	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
have	
elevated	
levels	
of	
circu-	
lating	
inflammatory	
mediators	
related	
to	
repetitive	
episodes	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
and	
increased	
sympathetic	
nervous	
system	
activity	
.	

Both	
of	
these	
findings	
may	
be	
import-	
ant	
in	
the	
pathogenesis	
of	
hypertension	DISEASE
and	
cardiovascular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
related	
to	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Obstructive	
apneas	
are	
documented	
by	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
with	
ongoing	
respiratory	
efforts	
during	
PSG	
or	
an	
OCST	
.	

When	
breathing	
effort	
is	
recorded	
with	
respiratory	
inductance	
plethysmography	
,	
it	
typically	
shows	
paradoxical	
movement	
of	
the	
rib	
cage	
and	
abdomen	
.	

If	
esophageal	
manometry	
is	
used	
,	
increasingly	
large	
swings	
between	
inspiratory	
and	
expiratory	
efforts	
are	
observed	
.	

Obstructive	DISEASE
hypopneas	DISEASE
are	
a	
reduction	
rather	
than	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
with	
ongoing	
respiratory	
effort	
.	

Increasing	
respira-	
tory	
effort	
with	
constant	
or	
reduced	
flow	
is	
indicative	
of	
increased	
upper	
airway	
resis-	
tance	
.	

This	
state	
is	
most	
accurately	
identified	
with	
a	
quantitative	
measurement	
of	
flow	
and	
esophageal	
manometry	
,	
although	
it	
can	
be	
inferred	
when	
there	
is	
obvious	
inspira-	
tory	
airflow	
limitation	
(	
flattening	
of	
the	
inspiratory	
flow	
)	
on	
a	
nasal	
pressure	
recording	
.	

Although	
patients	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
have	
predominantly	
obstructive	DISEASE
events	
,	
they	
may	
also	
have	
variable	
amounts	
of	
central	
apneas	
.	

In	
some	
patients	
,	
these	
resolve	
with	
admin-	
istration	
of	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
,	
whereas	
in	
others	
frequent	
central	
apneas	
either	
persist	
or	
emerge	
,	
at	
least	
during	
the	
initial	
night	
of	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
treatment	
.	

Oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
typically	
declines	
for	
a	
variable	
period	
of	
time	
following	
the	
onset	
of	
an	
event	
(	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
hypopnea	DISEASE
)	
,	
with	
the	
nadir	
usually	
occurring	
after	
normal	
breath-	
ing	
resumes	
.	

The	
degree	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
may	
range	
from	
as	
little	
as	
1	
%	
to	
2	
%	
,	
up	
to	
30	
%	
to	
40	
%	
or	
greater	
.	

If	
the	
baseline	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
is	
normal	
,	
there	
may	
be	
no	
discernible	
drop	
in	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
despite	
evidence	
of	
airflow	DISEASE
limitation	DISEASE
fol-	DISEASE
lowed	
by	
arousal	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
some	
events	
associated	
with	
evidence	
of	
increased	
respi-	
ratory	
effort	
(	
and/or	
flattening	
of	
inspiratory	
flow	
)	
and	
an	
arousal	
at	
event	
termination	
may	
not	
meet	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
hypopnea	DISEASE
.	

These	
events	
are	
defined	
as	
RERAs	
.	

These	
events	
are	
presumed	
to	
have	
the	
same	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
as	
obstructive	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
(	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
)	
and	
are	
considered	
to	
be	
as	
much	
of	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
symptoms	
of	
unrefreshing	DISEASE
sleep	
,	
daytime	DISEASE
somnolence	DISEASE
,	
and	
fatigue	DISEASE
as	
frank	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
hypopnea	DISEASE
.	

The	
EEG	
may	
provide	
evidence	
of	
a	
brief	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
,	
and	
the	
submental	
electro-	
myogram	
may	
demonstrate	
a	
burst	
of	
activity	
indicating	
upper	
airway	
dilating	
muscle	
activation	
immediately	
preceding	
the	
resumption	
of	
normal	
breathing	
.	

Microphones	
may	
record	
a	
sudden	
resumption	
of	
loud	
snoring	DISEASE
.	

Obstructive	DISEASE
apneas	DISEASE
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
may	
be	
accompanied	
by	
bradyarrhythmias	DISEASE
,	
tachyarrhythmias	DISEASE
,	
or	
both	
;	
however	
,	
the	
prevalence	
of	
this	
finding	
in	
patients	
varies	
widely	
.	

At	
the	
time	
of	
arousals	DISEASE
,	
there	
is	
often	
a	
surge	
in	
both	
sympathetic	
nervous	
system	
activity	
and	
systemic	
blood	
pressure	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

In	
contrast	
to	
patients	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
those	
with	
isolated	
snoring	DISEASE
will	
not	
exhibit	
obstruc-	
tive	DISEASE
apneas	DISEASE
,	
hypopneas	DISEASE
,	
or	
RERAs	
on	
PSG	
or	
OCST	
and	
do	
not	
have	
other	
sleep	
symp-	
toms	
attributable	
to	
breathing	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
because	
arousal	
-	
based	
hypopneas	DISEASE
and	
RERAs	
can	
not	
be	
identified	
with	
OCST	
,	
OSA	DISEASE
can	
not	
be	
excluded	
if	
the	
OCST	
is	
negative	
.	

Patients	
with	
central	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
have	
predominantly	
central	
rather	
than	
obstruc-	
tive	DISEASE
apneas	DISEASE
,	
hypopneas	DISEASE
,	
or	
RERAs	
as	
the	
primary	
finding	
on	
PSG	
or	
OCST	
.	

If	
mixed	
apneas	
are	
predominant	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
should	
be	
made	
.	

Patients	
with	
obesity	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
will	
demonstrate	
daytime	
hypercap-	CHEMICAL
nia	
.	

Snoring	DISEASE
may	
not	
be	
a	
prominent	
feature	
,	
although	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
can	
occur	
.	

Patients	
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
may	
show	
episodes	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
without	
evidence	
of	
airflow	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
on	
PSG	
or	
OCST	
.	

Confirmation	
of	
nocturnal	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
will	
be	
diagnostic	
.	

However	
,	
if	
obstructive	DISEASE
apneas	DISEASE
or	
hypo-	
pneas	
are	
evident	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
should	
be	
made	
instead	
of	
,	
or	
in	
addition	
to	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
such	
as	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
idio-	DISEASE
pathic	DISEASE
hypersomnia	DISEASE
,	
and	
insufficient	
sleep	
.	

These	
conditions	
often	
can	
be	
identified	
on	
the	
basis	
of	
history	
,	
but	
PSG	
and/or	
MSLT	
may	
be	
required	
to	
confirm	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
nocturnal	DISEASE
dyspnea	DISEASE
,	
such	
as	
noc-	
turnal	
panic	DISEASE
attacks	DISEASE
,	
nocturnal	DISEASE
gastroesophageal	DISEASE
reflux	DISEASE
,	
asthma	DISEASE
,	
paroxysmal	
nocturnal	
dyspnea	DISEASE
from	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
and	
nocturnal	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
pectoris	DISEASE
.	

In	
many	
cases	
,	
absence	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
and	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
will	
be	
highly	
suggestive	
of	
etiologies	
other	
than	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
the	
absence	
of	
obstructive	
apneas	
,	
hypopneas	DISEASE
,	
or	
RERAs	
on	
PSG	
will	
definitively	
exclude	
OSA	DISEASE
as	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Although	
substantial	
evidence	
implicates	
OSA	DISEASE
as	
a	
risk	
factor	
for	
coronary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
and	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
it	
has	
not	
been	
clearly	
demonstrated	
that	
treatment	
mitigates	
this	
risk	
.	

This	
is	
especially	
a	
concern	
for	
patients	
with	
mild	
OSA	DISEASE
who	
are	
not	
hypersom-	
nolent	
.	

The	
pathophysiologic	
mechanisms	
linking	
OSA	DISEASE
to	
increased	
risk	
of	
coronary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
and	
hypertension	DISEASE
require	
further	
investigation	
.	

Although	
there	
Sleep

Sleep	
Related

Disorders	
is	
a	
clear	
association	
between	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
type	
2	
diabetes	DISEASE
mellitus	DISEASE
,	
further	
studies	
are	
needed	
to	
determine	
whether	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
an	
independent	
risk	
factor	
and	
what	
mechanisms	
are	
involved

Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
Pediatric	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
intermittent	
complete	
or	
partial	
obstruction	
(	
obstruc-	
tive	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
or	
hypopnea	DISEASE
)	
;	
prolonged	
partial	
upper

obstruction	DISEASE
;	
or	
both	
prolonged	
and	
intermittent	
obstructions	DISEASE
that	
disrupt	
normal	
ventilation	
during	
sleep	
,	
normal	
sleep	
patterns	
,	
or	
both	
.	

Children	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
may	
demonstrate	
several	
breathing	
patterns	
during	
sleep	
.	

Some	
children	
have	
cyclic	
episodes	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
obstructive	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
,	
similar	
to	
that	
of	
adults	
with	
the	
syndrome	
.	

However	
,	
some	
patients	
,	
particularly	
younger	
children	
,	
have	
a	
pattern	
of	
obstructive	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
,	
which	
consists	
of	
long	
periods	
of	
persistent	
partial	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
associated	
with	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
,	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desatu-	
ration	
,	
or	
both	
.	

Some	
children	
may	
manifest	
a	
pattern	
of	
UARS	DISEASE
similar	
to	
that	
seen	
in	
adults	
,	
including	
snoring	DISEASE
without	
identifiable	
airflow	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
and	
increasingly	
negative	
esophageal	
pressure	
swings	
and	
cyclic	
arousals	DISEASE
.	

In	
children	
,	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
occurs	
predominantly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Children	
often	
do	
not	
have	
cor-	
tical	
arousals	DISEASE
in	
response	
to	
the	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
,	
although	
they	
may	
have	
movement	
or	
autonomic	
arousals	DISEASE
.	

Perhaps	
as	
a	
result	
of	
this	
higher	
arousal	
threshold	
,	
sleep	
architecture	
is	
usually	
normal	
,	
with	
normal	
amounts	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

Even	
short	
obstructive	
apneas	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
severe	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
because	
children	
have	
a	
lower	
functional	
residual	
capacity	
and	
a	
higher	
metabolic	
rate	
than	
adults	
.	

Most	
children	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
present	
with	
a	
history	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
and	
difficulty	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
.	

Snoring	DISEASE
is	
usually	
loud	
and	
may	
be	
punctuated	
by	
pauses	
and	
gasps	
,	
with	
associated	
movements	
or	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
some	
patients	
,	
particu-	
larly	
infants	
and	
those	
with	
neuromuscular	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
,	
may	
not	
snore	
.	

Patients	
with	
obstructive	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
often	
have	
continuous	
snoring	DISEASE
without	
pauses	
or	
arous-	
als	
.	

Children	
have	
a	
very	
compliant	
rib	
cage	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
paradoxical	
breathing	
is	
a	
prominent	
sign	
in	
these	
patients	
(	
note	
that	
paradoxical	
breathing	
during	
REM	
sleep	
is	
a	
normal	
phenomenon	
in	
young	
children	
up	
to	
at	
least	
age	
three	
years	
)	
.	

A	
pectus	DISEASE
excavatum	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Thoracic	
retractions	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Children	
may	
sleep	
in	
unusual	
positions	
,	
such	
as	
seated	
or	
with	
their	
neck	
hyperextended	
.	

Diaphoresis	DISEASE
may	
be	
observed	
.	

Morning	
headaches	DISEASE
may	
also	
occur	
.	

Many	
parents	
of	
children	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
are	
so	
concerned	
about	
their	
child	
’s	
breathing	
that	
they	
sleep	
with	
their	
child	
or	
stimu-	
late	
their	
child	
to	
terminate	
the	
apneas	
.	

Excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
,	
especially	
in	
older	
children	
and	
adoles-	
cents	
,	
but	
is	
seen	
less	
commonly	
in	
children	
than	
in	
adults	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Developmental	
,	
behavioral	
,	
and	
learning	
issues	
are	
frequently	
present	
.	

These	
may	
include	
attention	
problems	
,	
hyperactivity	DISEASE
,	
moodiness	DISEASE
,	
irritability	DISEASE
,	
and	
impaired	
academic	
performance	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Hypoxemia	DISEASE
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
are	
often	
present	
during	
sleep	
and	
may	
be	
severe	
.	

A	
prom-	
inent	
sinus	DISEASE
arrhythmia	DISEASE
is	
often	
seen	
,	
although	
other	
arrhythmias	DISEASE
are	
rare	
.	

Secondary	DISEASE
enuresis	DISEASE
may	
occur	
.	

Breathing	
during	
wakefulness	
is	
normal	
,	
although	
mouth	
breath-	
ing	
secondary	
to	
adenoidal	DISEASE
hypertrophy	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
.	

Other	
nonspecific	
daytime	
symptoms	
related	
to	
adenotonsillar	DISEASE
hypertrophy	DISEASE
,	
such	
as	
frequent	
upper	
respiratory	
tract	
infections	DISEASE
or	
dysphagia	DISEASE
,	
may	
occur	
.	

Although	
studies	
have	
shown	
that	
children	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
generally	
have	
larger	
tonsils	
and	
adenoidal	
tissue	
than	
do	
other	
children	
,	
the	
size	
of	
the	
tonsils	
and	
adenoidal	
tissue	
does	
not	
predict	
disease	
in	
individual	
patients	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Clinical	
presentations	
include	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
obstructive	DISEASE

and	
recurrent

associated	
with	
increased

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
in	
children	
has	
been	
estimated	
at	
1	
%	
to	
4	
%	
,	
but	
the	
prevalence	
may	
currently	
be	
higher	
due	
to	
the	
pediatric	
obesity	DISEASE
epidemic	
.	

The	
prevalence	
in	
infants	
and	
adolescents	
is	
unknown	
.	

In	
prepubertal	
children	
,	
the	
disease	
occurs	
equally	
among	
boys	
and	
girls	
;	
in	
adolescents	
,	
data	
suggest	
the	
prevalence	
may	
be	
higher	
in	
males	
.	

There	
appears	
to	
be	
a	
higher	
prevalence	
in	
black	
children	
than	
white	
children	
;	
the	
prev-	
alence	
in	
other	
ethnic	
groups	
is	
unknown	
.	

The	
disease	
can	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
,	
from	
the	
neonatal	
period	
to	
adolescence	
,	
but	
in	
otherwise	
healthy	
children	
it	
is	
most	
common	
in	
the	
preschool	
age	
(	
in	
association	
with	
adenotonsillar	DISEASE
hypertrophy	DISEASE
)	
and	
in	
adolescents	
(	
in

)	
.	

Predisposing

and	
obesity	DISEASE
are	
the	
most

Children	
with	
craniofacial	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
,	
particularly	
micrognathia	DISEASE
or	
midfacial	
hypoplasia	DISEASE
,	
are	
at	
risk	
.	

Those	
with	
Down	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
are	
particularly	
at	
risk	
for	
having	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Children	
with	
neuromuscular	DISEASE
diseases	DISEASE
often	
have	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
muscle	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
,	
which	
predisposes	
to	
airway	
collapse	
.	

Children	
with	
cerebral	DISEASE
palsy	DISEASE
may	
be	
predisposed	
to	
OSA	DISEASE
because	
of	
spasticity	DISEASE
,	
weakness	DISEASE
,	
or	
incoordination	DISEASE
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
muscles	
.	

Infants	
with	
gastroesophageal	DISEASE
reflux	DISEASE
may	
develop	
OSA	DISEASE
due	
to	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
edema	DISEASE
or	
laryngospasm	DISEASE
.	

Other	
medical	
conditions	
such	
as	
mucopoly-	
saccharidosis	
and	
sickle	DISEASE

may	
predispose	
to	
OSA	DISEASE

Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
exact	
course	
of	
pediatric	
OSA	DISEASE
has	
not	
been	
well	
studied	
.	

Symptoms	
typically	
begin	
within	
the	
first	
few	
years	
of	
life	
,	
although	
the	
disease	
may	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
until	
many	
years	
later	
.	

The	
natural	
course	
of	
untreated	
OSA	DISEASE
is	
not	
known	
.	

A	
few	
short

term	
studies	
suggest	
that	
some	
children	
with	
mild	
disease	
may	
improve	
,	
or	
conversely

have	
worsening	
of	
the	
condition

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
In	
children	
,	
as	
in	
adults	
,	
OSA	DISEASE
results	
from	
a	
combination	
of	
abnormal	
neuromuscular	
control	
and	
anatomical	
narrowing	
of	
the	
collapsible	
(	
supracartilaginous	
)	
portion	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
.	

During	
wakefulness	
,	
the	
patient	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
compensates	
by	
augmenting	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
to	
dilate	
the	
upper	
airway	
;	
thus	
,	
obstructive	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
does	
not	
occur	
.	

During	
sleep	
,	
there	
is	
a	
decrease	
in	
ventilatory	
drive	
and	
in	
neuromuscular	
tone	
,	
facilitating	
upper	
airway	
collapse	
.	

The	
resultant	
recurrent	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
,	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
,	
and	
sleep	
disruption	
may	
lead	
to	
neurobehavioral	
,	
cardiovascular	
,	
and	
growth	
abnor-	
malities	
.	

Childhood	
OSA	DISEASE
has	
also	
been	
associated	
with	
metabolic	
and	
inflammatory	
abnormalities	
.	

In	
most	
children	
who	
are	
otherwise	
healthy	
,	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
is	
primarily	
due	
to	
adenotonsillar	DISEASE
hypertrophy	DISEASE
.	

Pediatric	
OSA	DISEASE
also	
occurs	
in	
association	
with	
obesity	DISEASE
,	
which	
is	
becoming	
increasingly	
prevalent	
.	

Other	
causes	
for	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
include	
craniofacial	DISEASE
anomalies	DISEASE
,	
particularly	
those	
involving	
midface	DISEASE
hypoplasia	DISEASE
or	
micrognathia	
/	
retrognathia	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
children	
with	
decreased	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
or	
abnormal	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
function	
,	
such	
as	
children	
with	
muscular	DISEASE
dys-	DISEASE
trophy	
or	
cerebral	DISEASE
palsy	DISEASE
,	
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	
PSG	
demonstrates	
obstructive	
and	
mixed	
apneas	
,	
hypopneas	DISEASE
,	
or	
periods	
of	
obstructive	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

In	
children	
,	
obstructive	
apneas	
lasting	
two	
respiratory	
cycles	
or	
longer	
are	
scored	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
adults	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
EEG	
arousals	DISEASE
may	
or	
may	
not	
be	
present	
fol-	
lowing	
apneas	
,	
especially	
in	
young	
children	
,	
although	
subcortical	
/	
autonomic	
arousals	DISEASE
(	
as	
manifested	
by	
body	
movements	
,	
tachycardia	DISEASE
,	
or	
measurements	
of	
pulse	
transit	
time	
or	
arterial	
tonometry	
)	
may	
occur	
.	

Possibly	
as	
a	
result	
of	
the	
higher	
arousal	
threshold	
,	
sleep	
architecture	
is	
usually	
preserved	
.	

Apneas	DISEASE
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
occur	
primarily	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
and	
breathing	
may	
be	
totally	
normal	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

Obstructive	DISEASE
events	
are	
frequently	
associated	
with	
desaturation	DISEASE
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
.	

Evaluation	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
by	
endoscopy	
,	
radiography	
,	
computed	
tomographic	
scans	
,	
or	
magnetic	
resonance	
imaging	
studies	
may	
show	
large	
tonsils	
and	
adenoidal	
tissue	
and	
a	
narrow	
upper	
airway	
,	
although	
these	
tests	
are	
not	
performed	
routinely

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Pediatric	
OSA	DISEASE
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
isolated	
snoring	DISEASE
.	

Children	
with	
snoring	DISEASE
but	
without	
observed	
apnea	DISEASE
,	
labored	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
,	
daytime	
behavioral	
issues	
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
or	
other	
symptoms	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
may	
not	
require	
further	
laboratory	
investigation	
.	

However	
,	
children	
who	
have	
snoring	DISEASE
and	
symptoms	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
need	
evaluation	
to	
deter-	
mine	
whether	
they	
have	
isolated	
snoring	DISEASE
or	
OSA	DISEASE
(	
N.B.	
this	
distinction	
can	
not	
reliably	
be	
made	
clinically	
but	
should	
be	
based	
on	
PSG	
)	
.	

Children	
with	
primary	DISEASE
snoring	DISEASE
do	
not	
have	
apneas	
,	
gas	
exchange	
abnormalities	
,	
or	
frequent	
arousals	DISEASE
on	
PSG	
.	

Central	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
can	
be	
differentiated	
from	
OSA	DISEASE
by	
the	
lack	
of	
chest	
or	
abdominal	
wall	
move-	
ment	
associated	
with	
the	
central	
apneas	
.	

Mixed	
apneas	
may	
be	
seen	
and	
are	
included	
in	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Children	
with	
fixed	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
due	
to	
struc-	
tural	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
tend	
to	
obstruct	
both	
awake	
and	
asleep	
,	
and	
have	
stridor	
rather	
than	
snoring	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE
in	
children	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
nonobstructive	DISEASE
alveolar	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Children	
with	
lung	
or	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
may	
have	
desaturation	DISEASE
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
.	

It	
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
separate	
nonobstructive	
hypoventila-	
tion	
and	
desaturation	DISEASE
from	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
especially	
because	
the	
two	
conditions	
may	
coexist	
.	

In	
general	
,	
children	
with	
nonobstructive	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
will	
not	
snore	
and	
will	
not	
have	
paradoxical	
inward	
rib	
cage	
motion	
during	
inspiration	
,	
although	
the	
latter	
may	
be	
present	
in	
children	
with	
neuromuscular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE

,	
and	
insufficient	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
related	
epilepsy	DISEASE
may	
mimic	
obstructive	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
and	
may	
be	
indistinguishable	
from	
OSA	DISEASE
without	
the	
appropriate	
EEG	
monitoring	
,	
especially	
in	
infants	
who	
may	
have	
only	
subtle

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
is	
a	
need	
for	
further	
research	
in	
many	
aspects	
of	
pediatric	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Although	
studies	
of	
prevalence	
have	
been	
performed	
in	
the	
past	
,	
the	
prevalence	
has	
probably	
increased	
in	
recent	
years	
due	
to	
the	
increasing	
prevalence	
of	
childhood	
obesity	DISEASE
.	

Further	
data	
regarding	
the	
prevalence	
in	
infants	
and	
adolescents	
is	
needed	
.	

The	
natural	
course	
of	
the	
disease	
,	
the	
optimal	
techniques	
for	
monitoring	
patients	
during	
PSG	
,	
the	
effects	
of	
mild	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
and	
the	
threshold	
necessitating	
treatment	
require	
further	
study	
.	

The	
role	
of	
genetic	
,	
ethnic	
,	
and	
anatomic	
factors	
in	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
childhood	
OSA	DISEASE
also	
requires	
further	
study

Essential	
Features	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent	
central	
apneas	
or	
central	
hypopneas	

alternat-	
ing	
with	
a	
respiratory	
phase	
exhibiting	
a	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
flow	
(	
or	
tidal	
volume	
)	
.	

The	
longer	
cycle	
length	
(	
>	
40	
seconds	
;	
typically	
45	
to	
60	
seconds	
)	
distinguishes	
CSB	
from	
other	
central	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
types	
.	

The	
vast	
majority	
of	
patients	
with	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
have	
either	
systolic	
or	
diastolic	
heart	
failure	
.	

In	
systolic	
heart	
failure	
the	
cycle	
length	
is	
longer	
(	
longer	
respiratory	
phase	
)	
than	
in	
patients	
with	
diastolic	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
and	
there	
is	
often	
a	
delay	
in	
the	
nadir	
of	
the	
associated	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desatu-	
ration	
.	

Patients	
with	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
have	
normal	
or	
low	
daytime	
arterial	
PCO2	
(	
PaCO2	
)	
.	

Some	
patients	
with	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
have	
a	
mixture	
of	
obstructive	DISEASE
and	
central	
apneas	
with	
more	
central	
apneas	
in	
the	
later	
part	
of	
the	
night	
or	
when	
the	
patient	
is	
placed	
on	
posi-	
tive	DISEASE
airway	
pressure	
(	
PAP	
)	
.	

A	
diagnosis	
of	
CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
requires	
that	
events	
be	
predom-	
inantly	
central	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
with	
an	
average	
frequency	
of	
at	
least	
5	
/	
hour	
during	
a	
diagnostic	
PSG	
or	
either	
the	
diagnostic	
or	
therapeutic	
portion	
of	
a	
split	
-	
night	
study	
.	

For	
patients	
with	
a	
mixture	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
,	
the	
central	
apneas	
may	
appear	
only	
after	
elimination	
of	
obstruction	DISEASE
on	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
.	

In	
patient	
with	
CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
,	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
tends	
to	
occur	
at	
the	
zenith	
of	
respiratory	
effort	
between	
contiguous	
central	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	DISEASE
.	

This	
can	
result	
in	
sleep	
fragmen-	
tation	
.	

However	
,	
patients	
may	
complain	
of	
disturbed	
nocturnal	
sleep	
or	
nocturnal	
dyspnea	DISEASE
rather	
than	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Associated	
Features	
Presenting	
features	
of	
CSB	
pattern	
during	
sleep	
may	
include	
excessive	
daytime	
sleep-	
iness	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
or	
nocturnal	DISEASE
dyspnea	DISEASE
.	

Because	
many	
patients	
with	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
have	
known	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
their	
complaints	
of	
frequent	
awakenings	
or	
disturbed	
sleep	
may	
be	
falsely	
assumed	
to	
be	
entirely	
secondary	
to	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

Because	
studies	
have	
shown	
that	
approximately	
60	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
have	
some	
form	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
,	
a	
high	
index	
of	
suspicion	
is	
indicated	
.	

A	
CSB	
pattern	
can	
also	
occur	
during	
wakefulness	
and	
can	
be	
observed	
at	
bedside	
or	
in	
the	
clinic	
.	

Some	
studies	
suggest	
that	
the	
pres-	
ence	
of	
CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
during	
wakefulness	
is	
associated	
with	
a	
worse	
prognosis	
.	

Although	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
is	
the	
major	
cause	
of	
CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
,	
recent	
studies	
suggest	
that	
it	
can	
be	
noted	
after	
stroke	DISEASE
.	

CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
can	
rarely	
present	
in	
an	
idiopathic	DISEASE
form	
or	
be	
associated	
with	
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

As	
in	
other	
forms	
of	
CSA	CHEMICAL
,	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
are	
associated	
with	
absent	
or	
reduced	
ventilatory	
effort	
,	
respectively	
,	
due	
to	
diminished	
central	
respiratory	
drive	
.	

Of	
inter-	
est	
,	
a	
longer	
respiratory	
phase	
between	
apneas	DISEASE
is	
associated	
with	
a	
longer	
circulation	
time	
and	
delay	
in	
the	
saturation	
nadir	
.	

The	
CSB	
breathing	
pattern	
is	
characteristically	
observed	
during	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
and	
usually	
resolves	
or	
is	
attenuated	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

In	
patients	
with	
both	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
,	
the	
relative	
amount	
of	
central	
and	
obstructive	
apnea	DISEASE
can	
vary	
over	
time	
or	
even	
within	
the	
same	
night	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	

Some	
patients	
have	
combined	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	
,	
and	
the	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
may	
not	
manifest	
until	
the	
patient	
is	
placed	
on	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
treatment	
.	

These	
patients	
are	
considered	
to	
have	
both	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	
with	
CSB	
.	

Patients	
with	
systolic	
or	
diastolic	
heart	
failure	
may	
have	
CSB	
,	
but	
the	
cycle	
length	
is	
longer	
in	
those	
with	
systolic	DISEASE
dys-	DISEASE
function	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
neurological	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
may	
have	
CSB	
,	
but	
the	
characteristic	
cycle	
length	
is	
less	
well	
described	
.	

Demographics	
CSA	
with	
CSB	
generally	
is	
seen	
in	
subjects	
older	
than	
60	
years	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
this	
breathing	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
in	
the	
setting	
of	
chronic	
congestive	
heart	
failure	
has	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
25	
%	
to	
40	
%	
,	
depending	
on	
how	
patients	
are	
divided	
into	
those	
with	
predomi-	DISEASE
nant	DISEASE
OSA	DISEASE
and	
those	
with	
CSA	CHEMICAL
.	

In	
patients	
with	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
there	
is	
a	
striking	
male	
predominance	
in	
the	
occurrence	
of	
CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
the	
use	
of	
β	
-	
blockers	
and	
angiotensin	CHEMICAL
-	
converting	
enzyme	
inhibitors	
for	
treatment	
of	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
has	
not	
decreased	
the	
prevalence	
of	
CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
.	

Some	
form	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
is	
reported	
in	
50	
%	
to	
70	
%	
of	
patients	
following	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
depending	
on	
the	
AHI	
cutoff	
used	
for	
diagno-	
sis	
.	

Although	
OSA	DISEASE
predominates	
,	
central	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
is	
also	
common	
especially	
in	
the	
first	
few	
days	
following	
stroke	DISEASE
.	

CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
has	
been	
reported	
to	
occur	
in	
26	
%	
to	
50	
%	
of	
patients	
in	
the	
acute	
period	
following	
stroke	DISEASE
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
most	
important	
predisposing	
factors	
are	
the	
presence	
of	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
and	
possibly	
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

Within	
the	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
population	
,	
risk	
factors	
for	
CSB	
pattern	
during	
sleep	
include	
male	
sex	
,	
age	
older	
than	
60	
years	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
atrial	DISEASE
fibrillation	DISEASE
,	
and	
daytime	
hypocapnia	DISEASE
(	
i.e.	
,	
awake	
PaCO2	
of	
38	
mm	
Hg	
or	
less	
)	
.	

In	
general	
,	
greater	
pulmonary	DISEASE
congestion	DISEASE
(	
higher	
left	
ventricular	
end	
-	
diastolic	
pressure	
)	
predicts	
lower	
PaCO2	
.	

Some	
studies	
suggest	
that	
CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
occurs	
more	
commonly	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
.	

Although	
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
is	
often	
listed	
as	
a	
possible	
cause	
of	
CSA-	
CSB	
,	
there	
is	
scant	
literature	
documenting	
this	
association	
.

There

However	
,	
because	
it	
is	
seen	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
and	
possibly	DISEASE
renal	DISEASE

,	
CSA	
with	
CSB	
most	
likely	
has	
its	
onset	
following	
the	
development	
of	
one	
of	
these	
illnesses	
.	

In	
the	
setting	
of	
systolic	DISEASE
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
it	
is	
associated	
with	
a	
poor	
prognosis	
,	
as	
indicated	
by	
a	
greater	
adjusted	
relative	
risk	
for	
mortality	
-	
cardiac	
transplantation	
com-	
pared	
to	
patients	
without	
CSB	
.	

These	
data	
suggest	
that	
CSB	
pattern	
during	
sleep	
par-	
ticipates	
in	
the	
pathophysiology	
and	
progression	
of	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

Its	
clinical	
signifi-	
cance	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
stroke	DISEASE
or	
other	
neurological	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
remains	
less	
certain	
.	

In	
some	
patients	
with	
CSA	CHEMICAL
after	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
the	
pattern	
can	
transition	
to	
one	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

The	
presence	
of	
obstructive	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
following	
stroke	DISEASE
has	
been	
found	
to	
be	
associated	
with	
a	
worse	
prognosis	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	

Although	
there	
are	
reports	
of	
CSB	
in	
children	
,	
the	
condition	
is	
extremely	
rare	
in	
this	
age	
group	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
one	
study	
of	
patients	
with	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
across	
all	
age	
groups	
found	
CSB	
to	
be	
absent	
in	
children	
but	
present	
in	
40	
%	
of	
the	
adult	
patients	
with	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

A	
limitation	
of	
the	
study	
was	
that	
only	
ten	
children	
with	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
were	
studied	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
CSA	
with	
CSB	
generally	
arises	
because	
of	
instability	
in	
the	
respiratory	
control	
system	
.	

A	
high	
ventilatory	
drive	
and	
delay	
in	
chemoreceptor	
response	
to	
changes	
of	
PaCO2	
and	
PaO2	
(	
due	
to	
increased	
circulation	
time	
)	
are	
likely	
the	
major	
factors	
.	

This	
breathing	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
tends	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
chronically	
low	
PaCO2	
when	
awake	
and	
asleep	
.	

Hyperventilation	DISEASE
occurs	
due	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
responsiveness	
of	
the	
periph-	
eral	
and	
central	
chemoreceptors	
.	

The	
increased	
responsiveness	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
to	
both	
increased	
sympathetic	
tone	
and	
stimulation	
of	
vagal	
irritant	
receptors	
in	
the	
lungs	
by	
pulmonary	DISEASE
congestion	DISEASE
.	

The	
PaCO2	
in	
individuals	
with	
CSB	
pattern	
and	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
is	
closer	
to	
their	
apneic	
threshold	
than	
in	
those	
without	
CSB	
pattern	
(	
primarily	
due	
to	
a	
smaller	
sleep	
related	
rise	
in	
PaCO2	
in	
those	
with	
CSB	
)	
,	
so	
that	
even	
modest	
increases	
in	
ventilation	
can	
drive	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

The	
most	
common	
trigger	
factor	
for	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
is	
an	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
,	
which	
abruptly	
augments	
ventilation	
and	
drives	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

The	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
tidal	
volume	
results	
from	
prolonged	
lung	
-	
to	
-	
che-	
moreceptor	
circulatory	
delay	
,	
such	
that	
changes	
in	
PaCO2	
in	
the	
lung	
are	
trans-	CHEMICAL
mitted	
only	
very	
slowly	
to	
the	
chemoreceptors	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
gradual	
buildup	
and	
falloff	
of	
ventilatory	
stimulation	
.	

The	
length	
of	
the	
cycle	
is	
directly	
proportional	
to	
lung	
-	
to	
-	
chemoreceptor	
circulation	
time	
and	
inversely	
proportional	
to	
cardiac	
output	
.	

Accordingly	
,	
whereas	
the	
length	
of	
the	
ventilatory	
-	
apneic	
cycle	
in	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
typically	
shorter	
than	
40	
seconds	
,	
in	
CSB	
pattern	
it	
is	
almost	
invariably	
longer	
than	
40	
seconds	
(	
usually	
45	
-	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

One	
study	
of	
patients	
with	
varying	
degrees	
of	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
found	
a	
considerably	
shorter	
cycle	
time	
in	
patients	
with	
normal	
ejection	
frac-	
tion	
(	
e.g.	
,	
diastolic	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
)	
.	

The	
pathophysiology	
of	
CSB	
pattern	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
stroke	DISEASE
and	
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
has	
not	
been	
examined	
in	
any	
detail	
.	

However	
,	
apneas	
in	
association	
with	
these	
medical	
disorders	
are	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
to	
a	
reduction	
in	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

In	
individuals	
with	
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
pulmonary	DISEASE
congestion	DISEASE
(	
volume	DISEASE
overload	DISEASE
)	
may	
play	
a	
role	
in	
stimulating	
hyperventilation	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	

The	
polysomnographic	
hallmarks	
of	
CSB	
pattern	
are	
recurrent	
central	
apneas	
and	
central	
hypopneas	DISEASE
alternating	
with	
ventilatory	
periods	
having	
a	
prolonged	
crescen-	
do	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
airflow	
(	
tidal	
volume	
)	
.	

CSB	
pattern	
typically	
occurs	
at	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
NREM	
sleep	
and	
during	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
.	

It	
tends	
to	
dissipate	
in	
stages	
N3	
and	
R.	

In	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
the	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
is	
higher	
(	
further	
above	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
)	
.	

During	
REM	
sleep	
the	
hypoxic	
and	
hypercapnic	
ventila-	
tory	
responses	
are	
lower	
,	
thereby	
reducing	
the	
tendency	
for	
an	
overshoot	
in	
ventilation	
which	
may	
drive	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

Arousals	DISEASE
are	
frequently	
seen	
in	
association	
with	
CSB	
and	
are	
typically	
noted	
at	
or	
near	
the	
zenith	
in	
respiratory	
effort	
(	
or	
airflow	
)	
,	
although	
can	
occur	
at	
or	
near	
the	
onset	
of	
the	
respiratory	
phase	
pattern	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
arousals	DISEASE
tend	
to	
occur	
at	
apnea	DISEASE
termination	
in	
other	
CSA	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
a	
longer	
respiratory	
phase	
(	
and	
cycle	
length	
)	
is	
associated	
with	
lower	
cardiac	
output	
and	
longer	
circulation	
time	
.	

Central	
hypopnea	DISEASE
,	
rather	
than	
apnea	DISEASE
,	
can	
occur	
at	
the	
nadir	
in	
respiratory	
effort	
in	
patients	
with	
CSB	
and	
have	
been	
included	
in	
calculation	
of	
the	
central	
AHI	
in	
a	
sub-	
stantial	
number	
of	
investigations	
.	

Central	
hypopneas	DISEASE
are	
characterized	
by	
the	
absence	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
,	
flattening	
in	
the	
nasal	
pressure	
or	
PAP	
device	
flow	
signal	
,	
and	
thoracoab-	
dominal	
paradox	
.	

Central	
apneas	
and	
central	
hypopneas	DISEASE
are	
usually	
accompanied	
by	
modest	
oxyhemo-	
globin	
desaturation	DISEASE
;	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
seldom	
falls	
below	
80	
%	
to	
85	
%	
.	

The	
combination	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
and	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
sleep	
leads	
to	
sleep	
fragmenta-	
tion	
with	
reduced	
amounts	
of	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

Additionally	
,	
PaCO2	
less	
than	
40	

mm	
Hg	
is	
typically	
observed	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

In	
patients	
with	
both	
obstructive	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
central	DISEASE
apneas	DISEASE
,	
the	
proportion	
of	
central	
apneas	
tends	
to	
increase	
over	
the	
night	
,	
and	
this	
is	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
associated	
with	
a	
fall	
in	
the	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
.	

The	
lower	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
due	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
pulmonary	DISEASE
congestion	DISEASE
during	
the	
night	
with	
stimulation	
of	
juxta-	
capillary	
(	
J	
)	
receptors	
in	
the	
lung	
interstitium	
and	
a	
subsequent	
increase	
in	
ventilatory	
drive	
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
some	
patients	
have	
more	
CSA	CHEMICAL
-	
CSB	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
can	
usually	
be	
distinguished	
from	
CSB	
pattern	
by	
the	
absence	
of	
a	
history	
of	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
or	
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
and	
by	
the	
absence	
of	
a	
crescendo	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
decrescendo	DISEASE
breathing	DISEASE
pattern	DISEASE
between	DISEASE
central	DISEASE
apneas	DISEASE
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
(	
apnea	DISEASE
+	
ventilatory	
phase	
)	
in	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
typically	
less	
than	
40	
seconds	
.	

High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
only	
occurs	
at	
high	
altitude	
and	
is	
not	
associated	
with	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
or	
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
CSA	CHEMICAL
due	
to	
drug	
or	
substance	
have	
a	
history	
of	
use	
of	
this	
type	
of	
medication	
,	
and	
an	
ataxic	
breathing	
pattern	
may	
be	
present	
.	

If	
patients	
with	
CSA	CHEMICAL
asso-	
ciated	
with	
opioids	
manifest	
periodic	
breathing	
,	
the	
respiratory	
phase	
does	
not	
have	
a	
crescendo	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
decrescendo	DISEASE
pattern	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
the	DISEASE
cycle	DISEASE
length	DISEASE
is	DISEASE
shorter	DISEASE
.	DISEASE

Patients	
with	
CSA	CHEMICAL
due	
to	
a	
medical	
or	
neurological	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
without	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
will	
have	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
that	
does	
not	
have	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
morphology	
,	
as	
the	
name	
implies	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hypoven-	
tilation	
and	
hypoxemic	
syndromes	
can	
be	
readily	
distinguished	
from	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
by	
documentation	
of	
an	
awake	
PaCO2	
>	

45	
mm	

Hg	
and/or	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
CSA	
-	
CSB	
usually	
have	
an	
awake	
PaCO2	
<	

40	
mm	
Hg	
.	

In	
patients	
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
some	
central	
apneas	
may	
be	
present	
,	
but	
these	
events	
do	
not	
have	
a	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
morphology	
.	

Additionally	
,	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
in	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
syndromes	
is	
generally	
more	
pronounced	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
is	
distinguished	
by	
the	
presence	
of	
respiratory	
efforts	
during	
apneas	
.	

A	
few	
central	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	DISEASE
at	
sleep	
onset	
or	
during	
REM	
sleep	
are	
normal	
,	
especially	
in	
elderly	
subjects	
.	

These	
cease	
once	
sleep	
becomes	
stable	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues

pathophysiology

In	
infants

children	
,	
symptoms	
are	
supportive	
but	
not

.	

As

version	
of	
the

Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of

.	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
not	
required	
but	
may	
be	
present	
.	

If	
the	
patient	
meets	
criteria	
for	
both	
sleep

hypoventilation	DISEASE
and	
CSA	CHEMICAL
due	
to	
medical	
or

both	
diagnoses	
can	
be

In	
some	
patients	
other	
abnormalities	
of	
breathing	
such	
as	
ataxic	
breathing	
may	
be	
prominent	
.	
.	

A	
diagnosis	
of	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disorder	
without	
CSB	
does	
not	
exclude	
a	
diagnosis

Essential	
Features	
CSA	CHEMICAL
that	
is	
attributed	
to	
a	
medical	
or	
neurological	
condition	
(	
and	
does	
not	
have	
the	
pattern	
of	
CSB	
)	
is	
classified	
here	
.	

The	
majority	
of	
these	
patients	
have	
brainstem	
lesions	
of	
developmental	
,	
vascular	
,	
neoplastic	
,	
degenerative	
,	
demyelinating	
,	
or	
traumatic	DISEASE
origin	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Patients	
generally	
present	
with	
sleep	
fragmentation	
,	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
or	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Other	
signs	
and	
symptoms	
that	
are	
often	
,	
but	
not	
invariably	
,	
present	
include	
snoring	DISEASE
,	
witnessed	
apnea	DISEASE
,	
and	
awakening	
with	
shortness	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
breath	DISEASE
.	

The	
presentation	
varies	
with	
the	
cause	
of	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
and	
may	
include	
neurological	
findings	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
None	
.	

Some	
of	
the	
common	
medical	
and	
neurological	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
causing	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
not	
associated	
with	
CSB	
are	
listed	
in	
Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
(	
below	
)	
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
and	
demographics	
of	
this	
disorder	
vary	
with	
the	
underlying	
etiology	
.	

Patients	
with	
Chiari	DISEASE
malformation	DISEASE
(	
CM	DISEASE
)	
can	
present	
in	
infancy	
or	
childhood	
,	
but	
the	
most	
common	
age	
of	
presentation	
is	
20	
to	
40	
years	
.	

Patients	
with	
stroke	DISEASE
tend	
to	
be	
older	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Because	
of	
the	
heterogeneity	
of	
etiologies	
in	
this	
type	
of	
CSA	CHEMICAL
,	
predisposing	
and	
pre-	
cipitating	
factors	
are	
variable	
.	

In	
CM	DISEASE
there	
is	
herniation	
of	
a	
portion	
of	
the	
brainstem	
through	
the	
foramen	
magnum	
.	

In	
CM	DISEASE
type	
1	
,	
a	
portion	
of	
the	
cerebellar	DISEASE
tonsils	DISEASE
herni-	DISEASE
ate	
.	

CSA	CHEMICAL
in	
these	
patients	
is	
believed	
to	
occur	
due	
to	
impaired	
function	
of	
ventilatory	
control	
centers	
in	
the	
brainstem	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
None	
known	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
These	
factors	
vary	
as	
well	
with	
the	
different	
etiologies	
.	

In	
CM	DISEASE
the	
presentation	
is	
typi-	
cally	
age	
20	
to	
40	
years	
of	
age	
but	
can	
occur	
in	
infants	
and	
children	
.	

With	
the	
increased	
use	
of	
magnetic	
resonance	
imaging	
(	
MRI	
)	
,	
cases	
are	
often	
diagnosed	
before	
symptoms	
are	
severe	
.	

The	
CSA	CHEMICAL
following	
a	
cerebrovascular	
accident	
(	
CVA	CHEMICAL
)	
is	
abrupt	
in	
onset	
.	

In	
patients	
exhibiting	
both	
central	
and	
obstructive	
apnea	DISEASE
,	
the	
central	
apneas	
tend	
to	
resolve	
with	
time	
.	

Some	
post	
-	
CVA	DISEASE
patients	
with	
central	
apneas	
have	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
with

CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
caused	
by	
failure	
of	
the	
ventilatory

is	
due	
to

Diagnosis	
Patients

Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
Essential	
Features	
High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
characterized	
by	
alternating	
periods	
of	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
and	
hyperpnea	DISEASE
associated	
with	
recent	
ascent	
to	
high	
altitude	
.	

The	
pattern	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
an	
expected	
response	
to	
ascent	
to	
elevation	
.	

Only	
those	
individuals	
who	
manifest	
related	
symptoms	
,	
as	
described	
below	
,	
are	
diagnosed	
with	
this	
disorder	
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
of	
this	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
commonly	
less	
than	
40	
seconds	
and	
often	
as	
short	
as	
12	
to	
20	
seconds	
.	

The	
percentage	
of	
individuals	
exhibiting	
periodic	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
increases	
at	
higher	
altitudes	
.	

Approximately	
25	
%	
exhibit	
periodic	
breath-	
ing	
at	
2,500	
meters	
(	
8,202	
feet	
)	
,	
and	
virtually	
100	
%	
demonstrate	
periodic	
breathing	
at	
4,000	
m	
(	
13,123	
feet	
)	
.	

Periodic	
breathing	
has	
been	
described	
at	
altitudes	
as	
low	
as	
1,500	
meters	
(	
4,900	
feet	
)	
.	

Chronic	
exposure	
to	
altitude	
above	
2,500	
meters	
has	
also	
been	
associated	
with	
periodic	
breathing	
in	
some	
studies	
.	

Associated	
Features	
At	
altitude	
,	
individuals	
may	
complain	
of	
frequent	
awakenings	
,	
poor	
-	
quality	
sleep	
,	
and	
a	
sense	
of	
dyspnea	DISEASE
.	

These	
symptoms	
will	
often	
improve	
with	
time	
at	
moderate	
altitude	
but	
may	
persist	
at	
extreme	
altitude	
.	

Alterations	
in	
sleep	
associated	
with	
ascent	
to	
alti-	
tude	
include	
a	
reduction	
in	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
and	
increased	
arousal	
frequency	
.	

Total	
sleep	
time	
and	
the	
amount	
of	
REM	
sleep	
are	
either	
unchanged	
or	
decreased	
.	

Of	
note	
,	
the	
degree	
of	
both	
subjective	
and	
objective	
impairment	
of	
sleep	
quality	
was	
not	
correlated	
with	
the	
severity	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
in	
a	
number	
of	
studies	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
None	
known	
.	

Demographics	
The	
demographics	
of	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
are	
not	
known	
.	

High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
tends	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
high	
hypoxic	
and	
probably	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
response	
.	

Because	
men	
generally	
have	
higher	
chemorespon-	
siveness	
than	
women	
,	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
may	
be	
more	
common	
in	
men	
than	
in	
women	
.	

As	
stated	
above	
,	
periodic	
breathing	
will	
occur	
in	
virtually	
anyone	
ascending	
to	
higher	
than	
4,000	
meters	
and	
in	
some	
individuals	
at	
lower	
altitudes	
.	

The	
latter	
group	
probably	
comprises	
individuals	
with	
increased	
hypoxic	
chemoresponsive-	

ness	
.	

In	
one	
study	
,	
individuals	
both	
with	
and	
without	
periodic	
breathing	
at	
altitude	
had	
alterations	
in	
sleep	
architecture	
.	

Those	
with	
periodic	
breathing	
had	
a	
greater	
arousal	
index	
,	
although	
their	
sleep	
architecture	
was	
otherwise	
not	
significantly	
different	
from	
individuals	
who	
did	
not	
develop	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
only	
known	
predisposing	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
increased	
ventilatory	
chemoresponsiveness	
,	
primarily	
hypoxic	
ventila-	
tory	
responsiveness	
.	

A	
high	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
will	
lead	
to	
increased	
hyper-	
ventilation	
on	
ascent	
to	
altitude	
.	

This	
hyperventilation	DISEASE
leads	
to	
hypocapnic	DISEASE
alkalosis	DISEASE
that	
,	
during	
sleep	
,	
inhibits	
ventilation	
.	

Thus	
,	
repetitive	
cycles	
of	
apnea	DISEASE
and	
hyperpnea	DISEASE
develop	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

The	
obvious	
precipitating	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
this	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
ascent	
to	
altitude	
.	

The	
more	
rapid	
the	
ascent	
,	
the	
more	
likely	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
to	
develop	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

Some	
data	
suggest	
that	
ventilatory	
chemoresponsiveness	
is	
directly	
inherited	
.	

Because	
elevated	
hypoxic	
responsiveness	
is	
a	
predisposing	
variable	
in	
the	
development	
of	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
,	
it	
would	
seem	
likely	
that	
there	
would	
be	
a	
familial	
pattern	
in	
the	
development	
of	
this	
respiratory	DISEASE
abnormality	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
there	
are	
no	
data	
addressing	
this	
issue	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
This	
respiratory	
pattern	
will	
generally	
be	
evident	
during	
sleep	
immediately	
after	
ascent	
to	
altitude	
.	

This	
depends	
to	
some	
extent	
on	
the	
rapidity	
of	
the	
ascent	
,	
the	
elevation	
,	
and	
individual	
predisposition	
.	

However	
,	
it	
will	
be	
present	
most	
often	
on	
the	
first	
night	
at	
altitude	
.	

At	
moderate	
altitude	
,	
the	
breathing	
pattern	
may	
become	
more	
regular	
over	
time	
,	
although	
at	
extreme	
altitude	
it	
is	
likely	
to	
persist	
.	

One	
recent	
study	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
continued	
to	
increase	
over	
three	
days	
to	
two	
weeks	
of	
acclimatization	
.	

Studies	
of	
adaptation	
to	
altitude	
suggest	
that	
sleep	
quality	
may	
improve	
despite	
further	
increases	
in	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
hypoxia	DISEASE
itself	
may	
have	
an	
important	
role	
in	
disturbing	
sleep	
architecture	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
and	
symptoms	
may	
improve	
during	
acclimatization	
to	
altitude	
even	
if	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
actually	
increases	
.	

The	
complications	
of	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
,	
which	
are	
generally	
limited	
to	
disrupted	
sleep	
on	
the	
initial	
nights	
at	
altitude	
,	
include	
frequent	
awakenings	
,	
often	
with	
shortness	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
breath	DISEASE
or	
a	
sensation	
of	
suffocation	DISEASE
that	
may	
lead	
to	
fatigue	DISEASE
or	
sleep-	
iness	
on	
the	
following	
day	
.	

There	
is	
no	
clear	
association	
between	
periodic	
breathing	
and	
other	
altitude	
syndromes	
(	
high	
-	
altitude	
pulmonary	DISEASE
edema	DISEASE
,	
acute	
mountain	
sick-	

ness	
,	
and	
high	
-	
altitude	
cerebral	DISEASE
edema	DISEASE
)	
.	

In	
fact	
,	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
a	
marker	
of	
high	
hypoxic	
responsiveness	
,	
which	
generally	
yields	
improved	
oxygenation	
at	
altitude	
and	
a	
reduced	
frequency	
of	
the	
maladaptive	
syndromes	
.

Sleep	
Related

Disorders	
Developmental	
Issues	
Relatively	
little	
is	
known	
about	
differences	
between	
children	
and	
adults	
concerning	
periodic	
breathing	
at	
altitude	
.	

One	
study	
did	
compare	
breathing	
in	
children	
and	
their	
fathers	
.	

The	
children	
revealed	
reduced	
nocturnal	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
and	
associated	
hyperventilation	DISEASE
at	
high	
altitude	
similar	
to	
the	
adults	
,	
but	
their	
breathing	
pattern	
was	
more	
stable	
.	

The	
investigators	
hypothesized	
that	
children	
may	
have	
a	
lower	
apnea	DISEASE

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
product	
of	
the	
hyperventilation	DISEASE
induced	
by	
the	
hypobaric	DISEASE
hypoxia	DISEASE
encountered	
at	
altitude	
.	

At	
2,500	
meters	
the	
atmo-	
spheric	
pressure	
is	
approximately	
570	
mm	
Hg	
and	
the	
ideal	
alveolar	
PO2	CHEMICAL
around	
55	
mm	
Hg	
(	
depending	
on	
the	
level	
of	
PaCO2	
)	
.	

Actual	
arterial	
PO2	CHEMICAL
values	
will	
be	
lower	
,	
especially	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
shows	
a	
steep	
increase	
in	
ventilation	
when	
the	
arterial	
PO2	CHEMICAL
level	
drops	
below	
55	
mm	
Hg	
.	

The	
increases	
in	
venti-	
lation	
associated	
with	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
result	
in	
hypocapnic	DISEASE
alkalosis	DISEASE
.	

Because	
PaCO2	
is	
the	
principal	
stimulus	
to	
respiration	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
a	
low	
PaCO2	
can	
yield	
a	
loss	
or	
reduction	
in	
respiratory	
drive	
,	
resulting	
in	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
hypopnea	DISEASE
.	

The	
greater	
the	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
hypoxia	DISEASE
,	
the	
greater	
the	
fall	
in	
PaCO2	
.	

Thus	
,	
individuals	
with	
brisk	
hypoxic	
responses	
more	
commonly	
tend	
to	
demonstrate	
this	
respiratory	
pattern	
.	

Over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
apnea	DISEASE
,	
the	
PaO2	
falls	
and	
PaCO2	
rises	
,	
eventually	
stimulating	
a	
resumption	
of	
ventilation	
.	

However	
,	
after	
several	
large	
breaths	
,	
the	
PaCO2	
again	
falls	
below	
the	
apnea	DISEASE
threshold	
,	
initiating	
another	
pause	
in	
breathing	
.	

This	
cycle	
is	
then	
repeated	
over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
night	
.	

Of	
note	
,	
the	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
often	
improved	
during	
REM	
sleep	
with	
reduced	
cycling	
.	

This	
is	
likely	
due	
to	
the	
decreased	
hypoxic	
and	
hypercapnic	
responsiveness	
characteristic	
of	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
in	
one	
study	
the	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
continued	
to	
increase	
up	
to	
seven	
days	
after	
ascent	
to	
altitude	
.	

This	
resulted	
in	
a	
lower	
PaCO2	
and	
higher	
PaO2	
.	

The	
reduction	
in	
peri-	
odic	
breathing	
in	
some	
individuals	
with	
adaptation	
to	
altitude	
despite	
a	
greater	
venti-	
latory	
response	
to	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
may	
be	
due	
to	
a	
lowering	
of	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

Other	
studies	
have	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
continues	
to	
increase	
over	
three	
days	
to	
two	
weeks	
of	
acclimatization	
despite	
improvements	
in	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
.	

The	
increase	
in	
both	
periodic	
breathing	
and	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
due	
to	
increased	
controller	
gain	
of	
the	
respiratory	
system	
.	

A	
number	
of	
studies	
have	
found	
that	
the	
impairment	
of	
sleep	
architecture	
does	
not	
correlate	
with	
the	
degree	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

One	
study	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
was	
greater	
on	
the	
third	
night	
at	
altitude	
compared	
to	
the	
first	
night	
.	

However	
,	
both	
the	
nocturnal	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
and	
amount	
of	
stage	
N3	
also	
increased	
on	
the	
third	
night	
compared	
to	
the	
first	
night	
.	

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
hypoxia	DISEASE
rather	
than	
periodic	
breathing	
might	
be	
the	
major	
factor	
disturbing	
sleep	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
The	
PSG	
of	
individuals	
with	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
demonstrates	
recur-	
rent	
central	
apneas	
with	
a	
cycle	
time	
of	
less	
than	
40	
seconds	
,	
and	
typically	
around	
20	
seconds	
.	

There	
is	
some	
degree	
of	
associated	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
.	

The	
apneas	
are	
short	
,	
generally	
8	
to	
10	
seconds	
in	
duration	
.	

In	
one	
study	
,	
the	
apnea	DISEASE
duration	
was	
around	
8	
seconds	
(	
7	
to	
9	
seconds	
)	
in	
children	
and	
approximately	
12	
seconds	
(	
10	
-	
14	
seconds	
)	
in	
adults	
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
is	
commonly	
less	
than	
40	
seconds	
.	

This	
breathing	
pattern	
occurs	
only	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
with	
more	
rhythmic	
respiration	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Because	
this	
breathing	
pattern	
is	
a	
physiologic	
adaptation	
to	
altitude	
,	
there	
is	
no	
specific	
number	
of	
apneas	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
that	
is	
considered	
normal	
or	
abnormal	
.	

The	
apneas	
and	
associated	
hyperpnea	DISEASE
can	
lead	
to	
recurrent	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
sleep	
,	
which	
often	
increase	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
while	
reducing	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

REM	
sleep	
(	
stage	
R	
)	
duration	
is	
generally	
preserved	
,	
as	
is	
total	
sleep	
time	
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
some	
studies	
have	
found	
a	
reduction	
in	
total	
sleep	
time	
and	
stage	
R	
as	
well	
as	
stage	
N3	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
the	
arousal	
index	
was	
only	
around	
25	
%	
of	
the	
AHI	
in	
some	
investigations	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
SRBDs	DISEASE
.	

The	
major	
distinguishing	
factor	
is	
,	
of	
course	
,	
recent	
ascent	
to	
high	
altitude	
.	

An	
individual	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
will	
likely	
continue	
to	
have	
this	
nocturnal	
respiratory	
problem	
at	
altitude	
.	

Altitude	
might	
even	
exacerbate	
the	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
mountain	DISEASE
sickness	DISEASE
demonstrate	
relative	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
at	
altitude	
(	
i.e.	
,	
breathe	
less	
than	
is	
encoun-	
tered	
in	
normal	
individuals	
at	
similar	
altitude	
)	
such	
that	
they	
are	
more	
hypoxic	
than	
normal	
individuals	
who	
have	
a	
greater	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
the	
same	
ambient	
hypoxia	DISEASE
.	

During	
sleep	
,	
these	
individuals	
often	
demonstrate	
further	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
.	

Some	
of	
the	
individuals	
will	
demonstrate	
apneas	
or	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

A	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
mountain	
sickness	
does	
not	
imply	
that	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
present	
.	

However	
,	
periodic	
breathing	
may	
be	
more	
common	
in	
these	
patients	
than	
previously	
appreciated	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
Recent	
studies	
suggest	
that	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
rather	
than	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
may	
be	
the	
major	
factor	
impairing	
sleep	
quality	
.	

Further	
studies	
relating	
changes	
in	
sleep	
and	
periodic	
breathing	
at	
altitude	
are	
needed

Users

The

Suboxone	CHEMICAL

)	
is	
often	
used	
for	
treatment	
of

can	
also	
cause	
drug

The	
description

sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Due	
to	
the	
sedating	
effects	
of	
opioid	
medications	
,	
the	
sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
not	
substantially	
improve	
even	
if	
the	
central

is	
treated	
successfully	
.	

However	
,	
one	
study	
of	
patients	
on	
chronic	
methadone	CHEMICAL
mainte-	
nance	
found	
the	
average	
Epworth

Scale	
score	
to	
be	
within	
normal	
range	
.	

In	
these	
patients	
,	
who	
manifested	
only	
mild

moderate	
OSA	DISEASE
(	
average	
AHI	
about	
18/	
hour	
)	
,	
the	
degree	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
correlated	
with	
a	
depression	DISEASE
index	
.	

A	
case

of	
patients

In	
this

(	
and	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
at

)	
is	
likely	
due	
to	
the

If

Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
This	
disorder	
is	
typically	
seen	
after	
opioids	
have	
been	
used	
for	
at	
least	
two	
months	
.	

An	
increased	
risk	
of	
death	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
with	
the	
use	
of	
potent	
narcotics	
.	

There	
has	
been	
a	
large	
increase	
in	
deaths	DISEASE
associated	
with	
methadone	CHEMICAL
due	
to	
the	
increasing	
use	
of	
this	
medication	
for	
chronic	
pain	DISEASE
.	

Many	
of	
these	
deaths	DISEASE
occur	
during	
sleep

Developmental	
Issues	
Information

the	
presentation	
of	
this

CSA	CHEMICAL
due	
to

has	
been

.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
presumed	
pathophysiology	
for	
the	
development	
of	
these	
varied	
breathing	DISEASE
abnor-	DISEASE
malities	
during	
sleep	
is	
the	
respiratory	DISEASE
depression	DISEASE
that	
occurs	
through	
action	
of	
the	
drugs	
on	
the	
μ	
-	
receptors	
on	
the	
ventral	
surface	
of	
the	
medulla	
.	

Studies	
have	
demon-	CHEMICAL
strated	
depression	DISEASE
of	
the	
awake	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
drive	
;	
however	
,	
it	
often	
improves	
after	
five	
to	
eight	
months	
of	
continued	
drug	
use	
.	

In	
one	
study	
the	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
drive	
never	
fully	
normalized	
.	

Another	
study	
of	
patients	
on	
chronic	
meth-	DISEASE
adone	DISEASE
maintenance	
found	
that	
the	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
drive	
is	
increased	
compared	
to	
that	
of	
control	
subjects	
.	

In	
this	
study	
the	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
response	
was	
reduced	
in	
comparison	
with	
that	
of	
controls	
who	
were	
not	
taking	
opioids	
.	

The	
difference	
was	
not	
due	
to	
a	
lower	
tidal	
volume	
but	
rather	
reduced	
respiratory	
rate	
.	

Differences	
in	
technique	
or	
patient	
population	
may	
explain	
the	
divergent	
findings	
.	

The	
cause	
of	
the	
ataxic	
breathing	
in	
patients	
on	
opiates	
is	
not	
known	
.	

However	
,	
one	
study	
of	
patients	
on	
chronic	
opioids	
found	
that	
the	
incidence	
of	
ataxic	
breathing	
increased	
with	
the	
total	
narcotic	
dose	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
The	
drug	
-	
induced	
central	
apneas	
may	
occur	
as	
a	
form	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
with	
runs	
of	
central	
apneas	
separated	
by	
a	
short	
ventilatory	
phase	
(	
2	
to	
4	
breaths	
)	
or	
intermittent	
and	
sporadic	
central	
apneas	
.	

The	
underlying	
breathing	
pattern	
may	
show	
a	
slow	
respi-	
ratory	
rate	
or	
an	
ataxic	
breathing	
pattern	
.	

The	
term	
ataxic	
breathing	
is	
sometimes	
used	
as	
a	
synonym	
of	
Biot	
breathing	
,	
although	
definitions	
of	
the	
latter	
term	
vary	
widely	
.

Ataxic	DISEASE
breathing	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
an	
irregular	
breathing	
rhythm	
as	
well	
as	
irregular	
depth	
of	
breathing	
(	
tidal	
volume	
)	
.	

Obstructive	
breathing	
events	
are	
also	
common	
in	
patients	
taking	
potent	
opioids	
and	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
both	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
often	
appro-	
priate	
.	

Prolonged	
obstructive	
apneas	
with	
severe	
arterial	
desaturation	
may	
be	
noted	
.	

The	
drug	
-	
induced	
central	
apneas	
occur	
mainly	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
and	
,	
in	
patients	
without	
coexistent	
obstructive	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
,	
the	
AHI	
may	
be	
much	
lower	
during	
REM	
than	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

Patients	
also	
tend	
to	
have	
a	
low	
arousal	
index	
and	
increased	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

Unlike	
other	
forms	
of	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
,	
drug	
-	
induced	
central	
apneas	
may	
occur	
during	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

This	
condition	
is	
best	
distinguished	
from	
other	
types	
of	
central	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
by	
the	
patient	
’s	
ongoing	
use	
of	
long	
-	
acting	
opioids	
.	

Other	
SRBDs	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
and	
may	
complicate	
PSG	
findings	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Further	
study	
is	
needed	
to	
determine	
risk	
factors	
and	
pathogenesis	
for	
development	
of	
these	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
patterns	
in	
users	
of	
long	
-	
acting	
opioids	
.	

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
these	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
patterns	
may	
play	
a	
role	
in	
the	
unex-	
plained	
increased	
mortality	
in	
this	
population

This	
also

Associated

.	

Essential	
Features	
Primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
of	
unknown	
etiology	
(	
idiopathic	
)	
and	
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent	
central	
apneas	
,	
defined	
as	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
during	
sleep	
associated	
with	
an	
absence	
of	
respiratory	
effort	
.	

Airflow	
and	
respiratory	
effort

simultaneously	
in	
a	
repetitive	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
fashion	
over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
night	
.	

This	
recurrent	
cessation	
and	
resumption	
of	
venti-	
lation	
can	
lead	
to	
sleep	
fragmentation	
,	
yielding	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
frequent	
nocturnal	DISEASE
awakenings	DISEASE
,	
or	
both	
.	

Thus	
,	
patients	
may	
present	
with	
symptoms	
of	
hyper-	DISEASE
somnolence	DISEASE
or	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
tend	
to	
have	
low	
normal	
arterial	
PaCO2	
during	
wakefulness	
(	
less	
than	
40	
mm	
Hg	
)	
.	

Patients	
with	
a	
known	
medical	
or	
neurological	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
that	
is	
believed	
to	
cause	
central	
apneas	
are	
classified

Patients	
generally

Other

that	
are

,	
but	
not

,

include

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	

The	
disorder	
is	
rare	
,	
precluding	
identification	
of	
any	
definite	
subtypes	
.	

Demographics	
Not	
known	
.	

Most	
studies	
suggest	
this	
disorder	
is	
rare	
,	
most	
common	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
to	
elderly	
individuals	
,	
and	
more	
frequent	
in	
men	
than	
women	
,	
although	
not	
all	
studies	
support	
this	
sex	
bias	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
CSA	CHEMICAL
in	
these	
patients	
occurs	
because	
the	
arterial	
PCO2	
(	
PaCO2	
)	
drops	
below	
the	
hypo-	
capnic	
apnea	DISEASE
threshold	
(	
HAT	
)	
.	

During	
wakefulness	
,	
drops	
in	
PaCO2	
do	
not	
result	
in	
apnea	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
during	
sleep	
,	
when	
the	
PaCO2	
drops	
below	
the	
HAT	
,	
respiratory	
effort	
ceases	
.	

For	
most	
patients	
,	
the	
HAT	DISEASE
is	
within	
a	
few	
mm	
Hg	
of	
the	
awake	
PaCO2	
.	

Any	
factors	
that	
narrow	
the	
gap	
between	
the	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
and	
the	
HAT	DISEASE
predispose	
to	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
.	

A	
high	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
CO2	CHEMICAL
seems	
to	
be	
a	
major	
predisposing	
factor	
in	
the	
development	
of	
primary	
CSA	
.	

This	
can	
lead	
to	
the	
instability	
in	
venti-	
latory	
control	
that	
characterizes	
the	
disorder	
.	

Frequent	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
can	
also	
predispose	
to	
the	
development	
of	
central	
apneas	
,	
as	
ventilatory	
control	
is	
somewhat	
unstable	
at	
sleep	
-	
wake	
transitions	
.	

Increased	
ventilation	
associated	
with	
arousal	
can	
result	
in	
a	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
HAT	
after	
the	
return	
to	
sleep	
.	

Because	
ventilatory	
drive	
is	
lower	
during	
REM	
than	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
hypocapnic	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
is	
much	
less	
common	
during	
that	
sleep	
stage	
.	

Two	
other	
variables	
have	
been	
discussed	
as	
possible	
predispos-	
ing	
factors	
,	
although	
their	
true	
role	
in	
the	
development	
of	
this	
syndrome	
is	
uncertain	
.	

First	
,	
frequent	
arousal	
or	
awakening	
due	
to	
low	
arousal	
threshold	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
insomnia	DISEASE
have	
been	
reported	
to	
lead	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
central	
apneas	
.	

Because	
ventila-	
tory	
control	
can	
be	
somewhat	
unstable	
in	
the	
normal	
wake	
-	
sleep	
transition	
with	
occa-	
sional	
central	
apneas	
being	
observed	
in	
otherwise	
normal	
individuals	
,	
any	
disorder	
that	
interrupts	
sleep	
may	
worsen	
CSA	
.	

Some	
studies	
have	
suggested	
a	
worsening	
of	
primary

position

but	
this	
has	
been	
more	
clearly	
documented	
in	
patients	
with	
CSB	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

Some	
data	
suggest	
that	
ventilatory	
chemoresponsiveness	
is	
directly	
inherited	
.	

Because	
elevated	
CO2	CHEMICAL
responsiveness	
is	
a	
predisposing	
variable	
in	
the	
development	
of	
idio-	
pathic	
CSA	
,	
it	
would	
seem	
likely	
that	
there	
would	
be	
a	
familial	
pattern	
in	
the	
develop-	
ment	
of	
this	
respiratory	DISEASE
abnormality	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
there	
are	
no	
data	
addressing	
this	
issue

The

can	
lead	
to	
sleep	
fragmentation	
,	
yielding	
either	
hypersomno-	
lence	
or	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

There	
is	
little	
evidence	
that	
these	
apneas	
or	
their	
associated	
hypoxia	DISEASE
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
lead	
to

Developmental	
Issues	
Criteria	
for	
apnea	DISEASE
of	
infancy	
and	
apnea	DISEASE
of	
prematurity	DISEASE
are	
detailed	
elsewhere	
and	
it	
should	
be	
noted	
that	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
is	
defined	
somewhat	
differently	
in	
infants	
and	
chil-	
dren	
than	
in	
adults	
.	

Central	
apneas	
that	
are	
brief	
(	
<	
20	
seconds	
in	
duration	
)	
and	
not	
associated	
with	
desaturation	DISEASE
or	
arousal	
are	
commonly	
observed	
in	
both	
premature	
and	
term	
infants	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
population	
studies	
report	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
occurrence	
of	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
with	
increasing	
age	
,	
especially	
in	
men	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
caused	
by	
instability	
of	
the	
respiratory	
control	
system	
in	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
and	
less	
commonly	
during	
stable	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

Central	
apnea	DISEASE
in	
patients	
with	
primary	
CSA	
most	
often	
occurs	
during	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
and	
is	
rare	
during	
stages	

N3	
and	
R	
sleep	
.	

Central	
apneas	DISEASE
tend	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
high	
or	
increased	
ventilatory	
responsiveness	
to	
CO2	CHEMICAL
.	

Arterial	
PCO2	
levels	
below	
the	
hypocapnic	
apnea	DISEASE
threshold	
lead	
to	
a	
cessation	
in	
ventilatory	
effort	
and	
,	
therefore	
,	
a	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
.	

Individuals	
with	
high	
CO2	CHEMICAL
ventilatory	
responsiveness	
tend	
to	
have	
lower	
PaCO2	
levels	
(	
both	
daytime	
and	
sleep	
)	
and	
a	
lower	
gradient	
between	
the	
sleep-	
ing	
PaCO2	
and	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

Hence	
,	
a	
smaller	
increase	
in	
ventilation	
is	
required	
to	
reach	
this	
apnea	DISEASE
threshold	
and	
inhibit	
ventilation	
.	

Individuals	
with	
high	
chemore-	
sponsiveness	
also	
hyperventilate	DISEASE
more	
in	
response	
to	
small	
changes	
in	
arterial	
PaCO2	
.	

This	
again	
often	
drives	
the	
PaCO2	
below	
the	
apnea	DISEASE
threshold	
,	
yielding	
a	
cessation

However	
,	
not	
all	
factors	
that	
cause	
greater	
ventilatory	
drive	
have	
the	
same	
effect	
.	

Studies	
suggest	
that	
although	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
increases	
chemoresponsiveness	
to	
PaCO2	
,	
the	
gap	
between	
the	
PaCO2	
and	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
is	
smaller	
(	
predispos-	
ing	
to	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
)	
.	

Metabolic	
acidosis	DISEASE
and	
nonhypoxic	DISEASE
chemoreceptor	
stimulants	CHEMICAL
tend	
to	
decrease	
HAT	
more	
than	
they	
decrease	
the	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
larger	
gap	
between	
the	
HAT	
and	
the	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
and	
lower	
likelihood	
of	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
.	

Metabolic	
alkalosis	DISEASE
tends	
to	
increase	
HAT	DISEASE
as	
well	
as	
decrease	
ventilatory	
responsive-	
ness	
,	
yielding	
a	
smaller	
gap	
between	
the	
HAT	DISEASE
and	
sleeping	
PaCO2	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
The	
PSG	
of	
the	
patient	
with	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
demonstrates	
more	
than	
five	
central	
apneas	
and/or	
central	
hypopneas	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
.	

The	
central	
apneas	
and	
central	
hypopneas	DISEASE
meet	
criteria	
for	
these	
respiratory	
events	
in	
adults	
or	
children	
as	
defined	
by	
the	
most	
recent	
version	
of	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated	
Events	
.	

Published	
studies	
of	
patients	
with	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
have	
required	
that	
>	
50	
%	
to	
85	
%	
of	
respiratory	
events	
be	
central	
apneas	
.	

Periodic	
breathing	
characterized	
by	
episodes	
of	
recurrent	
central	
apneas	
separated	
by	
periods	
of	
ventilation	
may	
occur	
.	

The	
inter-	
event	
respiratory	
phase	
is	
typically	
brief	
with	
a	
maximum	
of	
five	
breaths	
.	

The	
venti-	
latory	
phase	
between	
central	
apneas	
does	
not	
have	
the	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
CSB	
breathing	
.	

Central	
apneas	DISEASE
commonly	
lead	
to	
mild	
arterial	
oxygen	
desaturation	
,	
although	
more	
severe	
desaturation	DISEASE
can	
occur	
.	

Central	
apneas	DISEASE
may	
also	
lead	
to	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
,	
causing	
fragmentation	
and	
yielding	
increased	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
at	
the	
expense	
of	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
central	
apneas	
in	
these	
patients	
are	
less	
common	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

In	
summary	
,	
respiration	
,	
arterial	
oxygenation	
,	
and	
sleep	
architecture	
are	
affected	
by	
this	
disorder	
.	

Additionally	
,	
an	
arterial	
PaCO2	

less	
than	
40	
mm	

Hg	
is	
typically	
observed	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

These	
patients	
do	
not	
exhibit	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Normal	
individuals	
may	
have	
a	
few	
central	
apneas	
in	
the	
wake	
-	
sleep	
transition	
.	

However	
,	
once	
stable	
sleep	
is	
achieved	
,	
these	
apneas	
should	
cease	
.	

Normal	
individuals	
should	
not	
have	
more	
than	
five	
central	
apneas	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
.	

Primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
sleep	
related	
breathing	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Some	
patients	
with	
predominantly	DISEASE
OSA	DISEASE
will	
have	
central	
apneas	
during	
diagnostic	
or	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
titration	
studies	
.	

These	
apneas	
tend	
to	
resolve	
immediately	
or	
over	
time	
on	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
treatment	
.	

The	
pattern	
of	
central	
apneas	
in	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
differs	
from	
that	
of	
CSA	
with	
CSB	
.	

Primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
lacks	
the	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
respiration	
between	
contiguous	
central	
apneas	
noted	
in	
patients	
with	
CSA	
with	
CSB	
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
is	
longer	
in	
CSB	
(	
greater	
than	
40	
seconds	
and	
typically	
45	
to	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

The	
longer	
cycle	
length	
in	
CSB	
versus	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
due	
to	
a	
longer	
respiratory	
phase	
between	
central	
apneas	
.	

In	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
,	
the	
apnea	DISEASE
is	
often	
terminated	
abruptly	
by	
a	
large	
breath	
,	
and	
there	
are	
usually	
no	
more	
that	
4	
to	
5	
breaths	
between	
apneas	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
most	
patients	
with	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
respiration	
will	
have	
a	
history	
of	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
or	
a	
neurological	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
due	
to	
substance	
use	
,	
particularly	
potent	
long	
-	
acting	
narcotics	
,	
may	
exhibit	
periodic	
breathing	
with	
central	
apneas	
,	
but	
the	
pattern	
of	
ventilation	
between	
apneas	
does	
not	
have	
a	
crescendo	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
decrescendo	DISEASE
pattern	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
the	DISEASE
cycle	DISEASE
length	DISEASE
is	DISEASE
shorter	DISEASE
than	DISEASE
40	DISEASE
seconds	DISEASE
.	DISEASE

In	
addition	
,	
the	
underlying	
pattern	
of	
breathing	
is	
often	
ataxic	DISEASE
(	
irregular	
varia-	
tions	
in	
cycle	
length	
and	
tidal	
volume	
)	
and	
a	
low	
respiratory	
rate	
may	
be	
noted	
.	

Unlike	
primary	
CSA	
,	
central	
apneas	
can	
occur	
during	
stage	
N3	
in	
patients	
taking	
opioids	
.	

Patients	
with	
CSA	CHEMICAL
due	
to	
medical	
or	
neurological	
conditions	
not	
of	
the	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
pattern	
often	
have	
a	
history	
of	
a	
known	
neurological	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
recent	
cerebrovascular	
accident	
)	
but	
in	
others	
a	
high	
index	
of	
suspicion	
for	
an	
underlying	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
indi-	
cated	
.	

For	
example	
,	
patients	
with	
Chiari	DISEASE
malformation	DISEASE
may	
present	
in	
adulthood	
with	
unexplained	
central	
apneas	
and	
relatively	
few	
other	
symptoms	
.	

Thus	
,	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
a	
diagnosis	
based	
on	
careful	
exclusion	
of	
other	
causes	
of	
CSA	
.	

In	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemic	
syndromes	
,	
patients	
have	
normal	
or	
increased	
daytime	
arterial	
PCO2	
(	
PaCO2	
)	
with	
the	
onset	
or	
worsening	
of	
hypoven-	
tilation	
during	
sleep	
.	

Daytime	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
defined	
as	
a	
PaCO2	
>	
45	
mm	

Hg	
.	

Patient	
with	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
usually	
have	
an	
awake	
PaCO2	
<	

40	
mm	
Hg	
.	

The	
causes	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
include	
abnormalities	
in	
ventilatory	
control	
,	
neuro-	
muscular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
parenchymal	DISEASE
lung	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
or	
restrictive	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

PSG	
in	
these	
patients	
may	
reveal	
a	
few	
central	
apneas	
,	
but	
the	
predominant	
pattern	
is	
one	
of	
reduced	
tidal	
volume	
(	
shallow	
pattern	
of	
breathing	
)	
,	
often	
without	
a	
compensatory	
increase	
in	
respiratory	
rate	
.	

There	
is	
usually	
significant	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
secondary	
to	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
and/or	
ventilation	
perfusion	
mismatch	
.	

Patients	
with	
parenchymal	DISEASE
lung	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
neuromuscular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
or	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
typically	
have	
abnormal	
pulmonary	
function	
tests	
and	
the	
most	
severe	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
typically	
occurs	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Although	
primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
relatively	
rare	
disorder	
,	
additional	
prevalence	
data	
are	
needed	
.	

The	
pathophysiology	
of	
this	
disorder	
remains	
unclear	
.	

Specifically	
,	
the	
relative	
roles	
of	
instability	
in	
sleep	
state	
(	
low	
arousal	
threshold	
,	
delayed	
transition	
from	
wake	
to	
stable	
sleep	
)	
and	
respiratory	
control	
instability	
(	
elevated	
hypercapnic	
ventila-	
tory

)	
require	
further	
elucidation	
.

Definitive	
determination	
of	
the

Essential	
Features	
Primary	
CSA	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
infancy	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
prolonged	
,	
predominantly	
central	
apneas	
in	
children	
of	
at	
least	
37	
weeks	
conceptional	
age	
.	

These	
events	
are	
typically	
associated	
with	
physiological	
compromise	
(	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
,	
bradycardia	DISEASE
)	
,	
or	
the	
need	
for	
intervention	
such	
as	
stimulation	
or	
resuscitation	
.	

Obstructive	DISEASE
and/or	
mixed	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	DISEASE
may	
also	
be	
seen	
,	
although	
central	
events	
are	
the	
predominant	
finding	
.	

It	
is	
a	
disorder	
of	
respira-	
tory	
control	
that	
can	
be	
either	
a	
developmental	
problem	
associated	
with	
immaturity	
of	
the	
brainstem	
respiratory	
centers	
or	
secondary	
to	
other	
medical	
conditions	
that	
produce	
apnea	DISEASE
by	
mechanisms	
such	
as	
direct	
depression	DISEASE
of	
central	
respiratory	
control	
.	

Apnea	
in	
the	
neonate	
or	
infant	
may	
be	
exacerbated	
or	
precipitated	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
medical	
condi-	
tions	
,	
such	
as	
anemia	DISEASE
,	
infection	DISEASE
,	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
,	
metabolic	DISEASE
disturbances	DISEASE
,	
gastroesophageal	
reflux	
,	
substances	
,	
or	
anesthesia	
,	
which	
must	
be	
recognized	
and	
treated	
to	
stabilize	
the	
apnea	DISEASE
.	

If	
another	
medical	
condition	
appears	
to	
be	
the	
cause	
rather	
than	
an	
exacerbating	
factor	
for	
the	
CSA	CHEMICAL
,	
then	
the	
condition	
should	
be	
classified	
as	
CSA	CHEMICAL
due	
to	
a	
medical	
or	
neurological	
condition	
,	
or	
CSA	CHEMICAL
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
.	

Despite	
the	
heterogeneity	
of	
infant	
risk	
groups	
and	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
,	
most	
studies	
report	
a	
progressive	
decrease	
in	
frequency	
of	
apneas	
and	
risk	
of	
symptomatic	
apnea	DISEASE

Course	
,	
and

Onset	
is	
usually

of	
life	
.	

Some	
infants	
may	
be	
diagnosed	
by	
nursing

routine	
monitoring	
soon	
after	
birth

may	
have	
failure	DISEASE

The	
prognosis	
is	
generally	
good	
,	
with	
res-	
olution	
of	
apnea	DISEASE
over	
the	
first	
few	
years

The	
presence	
of	
persistent

apnea	DISEASE
may	
be	
an	
indication	
of	
an	
underlying	
medical	
condition

Developmental	
Issues	

This	
is	
a	
condition	
of	
infancy	
that	
normally	
improves	
over	
time	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Physiological	
factors	
contributing	
to	
apnea	DISEASE
are	
related	
to	
immaturity	
of	
respiratory	
control	
.	

These	
include	
developmental	
alterations	
in	
central	
drive	
,	
chemoreceptor	
or	
mechanoreceptor	
responses	
,	
and	
upper	
airway	
reflexes	
.	

Precipitating	
factors	
for	
wors-	
ening	
apnea	DISEASE
include	
gastroesophageal	DISEASE
reflux	DISEASE
,	
intracranial	
pathology	
,	
substances	
,	
anes-	
thesia	DISEASE
,	
metabolic	
disturbances	
,	
impaired

,	
and	
infection	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Apnea	
is	
predominantly	
central	
,	
but	
obstructive	
and	
mixed	
apneas	
may	
occur	
.	

Apneas	DISEASE
are	
seen	
most	
frequently	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Other	
diagnostic	
tests	
,	
such	
as	
a	
full	
EEG	
or	
evaluation	
for	
reflux	
,	
may	
be	
appropriate	
in	
individual	
cases

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
of	
infancy	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
the	
normal	
respiratory	
pauses	
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
.	

Normative	
respiratory	
data	
from	
several	
large	
studies	
show	
that	
healthy	
asymptomatic	
infants	
commonly	
have	
central	
respiratory	
pauses	
,	
either	
as	
isolated	
events	
(	
particularly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
)	
or	
after	
sigh	
breaths	
or	
movements	
.	

Primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
of	
infancy	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
the	
popular	
clinical	
term	
,	
ALTE	DISEASE

is	
not	
a	
specific	
diagnosis	
but	
an	
ill

-	
reported	
apnea	DISEASE
symptoms	
that	
range	
in	
severity	
from	
benign	
to	
life	
threatening	
.	

Recurrent	
,	
severe	
infant	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
is	
usually	
due	
to	
other	
comorbid	
conditions	
,	
such	
as	
gastroesophageal	DISEASE
reflux	DISEASE
,	
metabolic	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
or	
unrecognized	
neurological	
conditions	
such	
as	
seizures	DISEASE
,	
brainstem	DISEASE
malformation	DISEASE
,	
or	
neurodegenerative	
condi-	
tion	
;	
thus	
an	
evaluation	
for	
these	
conditions	
should	
be	
performed	
.	

Another	
diagnos-	
tic	
consideration	
is	
a	
form	
of	
child	
abuse	
(	
Munchausen	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE

)	
mani-	
fest	
as

obstruction	DISEASE
or	
attempted	
suffocation

Primary	
CSA	CHEMICAL
of	
infancy	
should	
be	
disassociated	
from	
the	
postmortem	
diagnosis	
of	
SIDS	DISEASE

Directions	
Infancy

Demographics	

The	
prevalence	
of	
apnea	DISEASE

prematurity	DISEASE
varies	
inversely	
with	
conceptional	
age	
.	

In	
studies	
,	
approximately	
25	
%	
percent	
of	
infants	
who	
weigh	
less	
than	
2,500	
g	
at	
birth	
and	
84	
%	
of	
infants	
under	
1,000	
g	
may	
experience	
symptomatic	
apnea	DISEASE
during	
the	
neo-	
natal	
period	
.	

Ninety	
-	
two	
percent	
of	
preterm	
infants	
will	
be	
symptom	
free	
by	
37	
weeks	
postconceptional	
age	
,	
and	
98	
%	
by	
40	
weeks	
after	
conception	
,	
with	
resolution	
in	
most	
infants	
by	
43	
weeks

.	

Apnea	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
prematurity	DISEASE
occurs	
equally	
in	
males	
and	
females	
,	
and	
in	
infants	
of	
all	
races	
and	
ethnic	
groups	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Developmental	
delay	
in	
respiratory	
control	
associated	
with	
premature	
birth	
is	
the	
major	
predisposing	
condition	
.	

Diverse	
factors	
are	
known	
to	
precipitate	
development	
of	
apneic	DISEASE
episodes	
in	
predisposed	
preterm	
infants	
.	

These	
include	
thermal	
instability	
,	
gastroesophageal	
reflux	
,	
intracranial	
pathology	
,	
substances	
,	
anesthesia	
,	
metabolic	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
impaired	
oxygenation	
,	
and	
infection	DISEASE
.	

Infection	DISEASE
with	
respiratory	
syncytial	
virus	
can	
increase	
the	
frequency	
and	
the	
duration	
of	
apneas	DISEASE
in	
predisposed	
infants	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
associated	
with	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
can	
present	
as	
apnea	DISEASE
of	
prematurity	DISEASE
.	

Persistence	
of	
apnea	DISEASE
after	
43	
weeks	
conceptional	
age	
should	
raise	
suspicion	
of	
addi-	
tional	
etiologic	
factors	
.

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
In	
preterm	
infants	
,	
apnea	DISEASE
is	
rare	
on	
day	
one	
of	
life	
,	
and	
its	
presence	
usually	
signals	
another	
illness	
.	

More	
typical	
onset	
occurs	
between	
the	
second	
and	
seventh	
days	
.	

Apnea	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
prematurity	DISEASE
usually	
ceases	
by	
37	
weeks	
conceptional	
age	
but	
may	
persist	
for	
several	
weeks	
beyond	
term	
,	
especially	
in	
infants	
born	
before	
28	
weeks	
postconception	
;	
apnea	DISEASE
beyond	
43	
weeks	
postconception	
is	
rare	
.	

Adverse	
outcomes	
for	
former	
preterm	
infants	
are	
more	
closely	
related	
to	
the	
prenatal	
or	
neonatal	
course	
,	
associated	
comorbidities	
,	
and	
environmental	
factors	
than	
to	
the	
apnea	DISEASE
of	
prematurity	DISEASE
per	
se	
.	

For	
most	
children	
,	
long	
-	
term	
outcomes	
for	
uncomplicated	
apnea	DISEASE
of	
prematurity	DISEASE
are	
excellent	
.	

However	
,	
the	
prognosis	
for	
infants	
with	
persistent	
recurrent	
apnea	DISEASE
spells	DISEASE
requiring	
frequent	
resuscitation	
is	
more	
guarded	
and	
depends	
on	
the	
cause	
of	
the	
apnea	DISEASE
and	
associated	
comorbidities	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	

This	
is	
a	
condition	
related	
to	
prematurity	DISEASE
that	
normally	
improves	
over	
time	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Physiological	
factors	
contributing	
to	
apnea	DISEASE
are	
related	
to	
immaturity	
of	
respiratory	
control	
.	

These	
include	
developmental	
alterations	
in	
central	
drive	
,	
chemoreceptor	
or	
mechanoreceptor	
responses	
,	
and	
upper	
airway	
reflexes	
.	

Precipitating	
factors	
for	
wors-	
ening	
apnea	DISEASE
in	
preterm	
infants	
include	
thermal	
instability	
,	
gastroesophageal	
reflux	
,	
intracranial	
pathology	
,	
substances	
,	
anesthesia	
,	
metabolic	
disturbances	
,	
impaired	
oxy-	
genation	
,	
and	
infection	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Most	
premature	
neonates	
are	
diagnosed	
with	
apnea	DISEASE
of	
prematurity	DISEASE
based	
on	
cardio-	
respiratory	
monitoring	
in	
the	
neonatal	
intensive	
care	
unit	
,	
rather	
than	
by	
PSG	
.	

When	
PSG	
is	
performed	
,	
central	
apneas	
are	
often	
shown	
to	
have	
a	
mixed	
component	
,	
with	
mixed	
apneas	
accounting	
for	
50	
%	
to	
75	
%	
of	
apneas	DISEASE
in	
small	
premature	
infants	
;	
studies	
suggest	
that	
obstructive	
-	
type	
events	
account	
for	
10	
%	
to	
20	
%	
of	
events	
;	
and	
pure	
central	
events	
,	
10	
%	
to	
25	
%	
.	

Periodic	
breathing	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Apnea	
of	
prematurity	DISEASE
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
normal	
,	
physiologic	
respiratory	
pauses	
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
in	
infants	
.	

Studies	
have	
shown	
that	
healthy	
asymptom-	
atic	
infants	
commonly	
have	
brief	
(	
<	
20	
second	
)	
central	
respiratory	
pauses	
,	
either	
as	
isolated	
events	
(	
particularly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
)	
or	
after	
sigh	
breaths	
or	
movements	
(	
in	
which	
case	
the	
apneas	
may	
be	
longer	
)	
.	

These	
infants	
are	
typically	
asymptomatic	
,	
with	
no	
changes	
in	
color	
or	
muscle	
tone	
.	

The	
differential	
diagnosis	
is	
long	
and	
includes	
apnea	DISEASE
secondary	
to	
severe	
gastroesoph-	
ageal	
reflux	DISEASE
,	
central	
nervous	
system	
malformations	
or	
hemorrhage	DISEASE
,	
seizures	DISEASE
,	
sepsis	DISEASE
,	
and	
rarely	
primary	
cardiac	
arrhythmias	DISEASE
.	

Comorbid	
conditions	
should	
be	
suspected	
whenever	
apneas	DISEASE
are	
severe	
or	
continue	
beyond	
43	
weeks	
gestation	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

The	
mechanisms	
underlying	
physiologic	
maturation	
of	
ventilatory	
control	
are	
not	
well	
understood	
.	

Further	
research	
is	
required	
to	
determine	
which	
infants	
are	
at	
greatest	
risk	
for	
severe	
apnea	DISEASE

does	
not	
exclude	
a	
diagnosis	
of

.	

That	
is	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
can	
be	
made	
based	
on	
the	
diagnostic	
sleep	
study

Essential	
Features	
A	
diagnosis	
of	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	CHEMICAL
is	
characterized	
by	
predominantly	
obstructive	DISEASE
events	DISEASE
(	DISEASE
obstructive	DISEASE
or	
mixed	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
hypopnea	DISEASE
)	
during	
a	
diagnostic	
sleep	
study	
with	
persistence	
or	
emergence	
of	
CSA	CHEMICAL
during	
administration	
of	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
without	
a	
backup	
rate	
,	
despite	
significant	
resolution	
of	
obstructive	
respiratory	
events	
.	

If	
the	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
is	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
CSA	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
patients	
are	
given	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
that	
CSA	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
rather	
than	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	CHEMICAL
(	
e.g.	
,	
a	
patient	
with	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
exhibits	
mainly	
obstructive	
events	
during	
diagnostic	
PSG	
but	
then	
exhibits	
predominantly	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
with	
CSB	
on	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
)	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Patients	
with	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	CHEMICAL
have	
several	
characteristics	
when	
placed	
on	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
without	
a	
backup	
rate	
.	

A	
high	
number	
of	
arousals	DISEASE
persist	
on	
PAP	
treatment	
,	
and	
the	
AHI	
is	
often	
higher	
during	
NREM	
than	
REM	
sleep	
.	

This	
is	
due	
to	
the	
fact	
that	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
central	
apneas	
almost	
invariably	
occur	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

Pressures	DISEASE
that	
are	
effective	
in	
controlling	
obstructive	
events	
during	
REM	
sleep	
prove	
ineffective	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
due	
to	
emergence	
of	
central	
apneas	
.	

If	
patients	
can	
attain	
stage	
N3	
,	
central	
apneas	
often	
decrease	
until	
interrupted	
by	
an	
arousal	
or	
transition	
to	
a	
lighter	
stage	
of	
sleep	
that	
precipitates	
another	
run	
of	
central	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	CHEMICAL
can	
have	
persistent	
sleep	
fragmentation	
on	
CPAP	
treatment	
and	
may	
report	
little	
benefit	
from	
therapy	
.

Demographics	
The	
percentage	
of	
patients	
with	
persistent	
or	
emergent	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
on	
the	
initial	
poly-	
somnographic	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
titration	
varies	
from	
2	
%	
to	
20	
%	
depending	
on	
the	
characteristics	
of	
the	
group	
studied	
(	
community	
or	
referral	
sleep	
center	
)	
and	
the	
methodology	
.	

If	
patients	
who	
are	
taking	
opioids	
or	
have	
underling	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
with	
CSB	
are	
included	
,	
the	
percentage	
is	
at	
the	
higher	
end	
of	
the	
range	
.	

The	
percentage	
of	
patients	
with	
central	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
that	
persists	
on	
chronic	
CPAP	
treatment	
(	
approxi-	
mately	
2	
%	
)	
is	
considerably	
lower	
than	
the	
percentage	
identified	
on	
the	
first	
or	
second	
night	
of	
CPAP	
treatment	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	

A	
number	
of	
factors	
have	
been	
hypothesized	
to	
cause	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	CHEMICAL
,	
but	
definitive	
data	
are	
not	
available	
.	

The	
patients	
presumably	
have	
characteristics	
that	
would	
predispose	
them	
to	
instability	
in	
ventilatory	
control	
or	
sleep	
maintenance	
.

These	
include	
a	
low	
arousal	
threshold	
and	
high

gain	
.	

Studies	
have	
found	
that	
often	
a	
small	
increase	
in	
end	
-	
tidal	
PCO2	CHEMICAL
can	
stabilize	
breathing	
in	
patients	
with

.	

Therefore	
,	
any	
events	
that	
predis-	
pose	
a	
patient	
to	
hypocapnia	DISEASE
can	
trigger	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
central

.	

In	
some	
,	
but	
not	
all	
studies	
,	
the	
overall	
AHI	
on	
the	
diagnostic	
PSG	
(	
or

portion	
of	
a

)	
was	
higher	
in	
the	
treatment

group	
compared	
to	
the	
patients	
without	
this	
diagnosis	
.	

In	
other	
studies	
,	
patients	
with	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	CHEMICAL
had	
more	
central	
apneas	
during	
the

to	
be	
male

However	
,	
identified

for	
treatment

vary	
considerably	
from

Developmental	
Issues	
Treatment

has	
not	
been	
described	
in

this

be	
due

who	
are

the

may

excludes	
patients	
who

better	
explained

PSG	
with	
administration	
of

often	
reveals	
adequate	
treatment	
during	
REM

and	
stage	
N3

but	
repetitive	
episodes	
of	
central

during

In	
some

a	
“

”	
at	
which	
central

appear	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Many	
patients	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
have	
a	
few	
central	
events	
while	
on	
PAP	
.	

However	
,	
in	
the	
majority	
of	
cases	
,	
the	
central	
AHI	
is	
not	
≥	
5	
/	
hour	
and	
central	
events	
are	
not	
≥	
50	
%	
of	
the	
total	
number	
of	
apneas	DISEASE
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
.	

Other	
patients	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
while	
on	
PAP	
,	
exhibit	
predominantly	
central	
events	
that	
are	
believed	
to	
be	
secondary	
to	
a	
CSA	
disor-	
der	
classified	
elsewhere	
.	

In	
this	
case	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
both	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
the	
CSA	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
appropriate	
,	
rather	
than	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
CSA	
.	

For	
example	
,	
a	
patient	
taking	
methadone	CHEMICAL
has	
predominantly	
obstructive	
events	
during	
the	
diagnostic	
portion	
of	
a	
split	
-	
night	
PSG	
.	

Once	
obstructive	
events	
are	
eliminated	
on	
PAP	
,	
CSA	
with	
ataxic	
breathing	
is	
noted	
.	

A	
diagnosis	
of	
both	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	CHEMICAL
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
should	
be	
made	
if	
criteria	
for	
that	
disorder	
are	
met

The

as	
well	
as	
the	
percentage	
of	
patients	
who

remains	
to	
be

Further	
prospective

in	
the

if	
the	
patient	
discontinues	
PAP	
treatment	
for	
a	
period	
of	
time	
and	
then	
restarts

.	

A	
number	
of	
factors	
have	
been	
hypothesized	
to	
increase	
the	
likelihood	
of	
treatment	
-	
emergent	
central

including	
overtitration	
(

)	
,	
undertitration	
(	
respiratory

)	
,	
the	
use

CPAP	
,	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
mask	
leak	
,	
and	
use	
of	
a

Further

to	
verify	
that	
these	
factors	
do	
indeed	
predispose	
a	
patient	
to	
develop

.	

The	
evolution	
of

also	
remains	
to	
be	
determined

that

,	
to	
what

over

what	
is

In

the	
increasing

further	
investigation	
of	
the

PSG	
shows	
worsening	
of	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
if	
PaCO2	
or	
noninvasive	
estimate	
of	
the	
PaCO2	
is	
measured	
.	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
is	
often	
present	
and	
,	
in	
such	
cases	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
both	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
OHS	
should	
be	
made	
.	
.	

Arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
is	
usually	
present	
but	
is	
not	
required	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

Essential	
Features	
OHS	
is	
characterized	
by	
obesity	DISEASE
and	
daytime	
hypercapnia	CHEMICAL
(	
arterial	
PaCO2	
>	
45	
mm	
Hg	
)	
that	
can	
not	
be	
fully	
attributed	
to	
an	
underlying	
cardiopulmonary	
or	
neurologic	
disease	
.	

Hypercapnia	DISEASE
worsens	
during	
sleep	
and	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
severe	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
.	

Hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
often	
worse	
during	
REM	
than	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

The	
majority	
of	
OHS	
patients	
have	
comorbid	
OSA	DISEASE
(	
80	
%	
to	
90	
%	
)	
.	

In	
these	
patients	
,	
daytime	
hypercapnia	CHEMICAL
may	
improve	
or	
even	
normalize	
with	
adequate	
PAP	
treatment	
and	
sustained	
adherence	
to	
treatment	
.	

Those	
OHS	
patients	
without	
OSA	DISEASE
exhibit	
sustained	
or	
intermittent	
episodes	
of	
shallow	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
associated	
with	
worsening	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
OHS	
may	
have	
few	
,	
if	
any	
,	
sleep	
com-	
plaints	
,	
or	
may	
present	
with	
considerable	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
including	
reduced	
sleep	
efficiency	
and	
frequent	
awakenings	
.	

Hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
may	
remain	
unno-	CHEMICAL
ticed	
for	
quite	
some	
time	
until	
sudden	
deterioration

cardiopulmonary	DISEASE
arrest	DISEASE
or	
severe	
decompensation	DISEASE
(	
acute	
or	
chronic	
hypercapnic	
respiratory	
failure	
)	
develops	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Patients	
with	
OHS	
commonly	
complain	
of	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
.	

The	
severity	
of	
hyper-	
somnolence	DISEASE
may	
not	
correlate	
closely	
with	
degree	
of	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
.	

Other	
symptoms

The	
prevalence	
of	
OHS	
in	
populations	
of	
patients	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
varies	
across	
studies

is	
often

the	
range	
of	
10	
%	
to	
15	
%	
of

Although	
the

is	
higher	
in	
men

the	
difference	
is	
not

as	
in

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Obesity	DISEASE
is	
believed	
to	
be	
the	
primary	
pathophysiologic	
factor	
responsible	
for	
hypoven-	
tilation	
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

Greater	
degrees	
of	
obesity	DISEASE
are	
often	
associated	
with	
worse	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
,	
but	
individual	
variations	
in	
the	
severity	
of	
hypercap-	
nia	
at	
similar	
weights	
may	
be	
seen	
.	

The	
use

central	
nervous	
system	
depressants	
,

as	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
,	
anxiolytics	
,	
and

further	
worsen	
respiratory

Patients	
who	
are	
hypercapnic	
and

will	
invari-	
ably	
become	
even	
more	
so	
during

the

Persons	
who	
are

with

either	
present	
initially	
for	
evalu-	
ation	
of

or	
are	
identified	
following	
one	
or	
more	
episodes	
of

failure	DISEASE
.	

The	
course	
can	
be	
variable	
but	
is	
generally	
slowly	
pro-	
gressive	
.	

Many	
affected	
individuals	
with	
severe	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
develop	
pulmonary	DISEASE

Polycythemia	DISEASE
is	
common	
in	
those	
with	
chronic	
hypoxia	DISEASE
.	

Although	
the	
risk	
of	
increased	
morbidity	
and	
mortality	
appears	
to	
increase	
with	
worsening	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE

,	
the	
specific	
relationship	
between	
sleep

hypoventi-	
lation	
/	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
and	
morbidity	
and	
mortality	
is	
not	
well	
defined	
.	

Obesity	DISEASE
,	
itself	
,	
can	
lead	
to	
other	
respiratory	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
,	
including	
shortness	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
breath	DISEASE
,	
dyspnea	DISEASE
on	
exer-	
tion	
and	
orthopnea	DISEASE
,	
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
demonstrable	
elevation	
of	
daytime	
PaCO2	
.	

However	
,	
in	
one	
study	
of	
inpatients	
with	
obesity	DISEASE
,	
those	
with	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
had	
an	
18	
-	
month	
mortality	
of	
23	
%	
compared	
with	
9	
%	
in	
the	
group	
with	
equivalent	
obesity	DISEASE
but	
no	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Many	
patients	
with	
OHS	
respond	
to	
CPAP	
or	
bilevel	CHEMICAL
PAP	
with	
improvement	
in	
daytime	
PaCO2	
.	

However	
,	
normalization	
of	
daytime	
PaCO2	
occurs	
in	
only	
a	
minority	
of	
patients	
.	

In	
one	
study	
,	
34	
%	
of	
OHS	
patients	
using	
PAP	
more	
than	
4.5	
hours	
per	
night	
had	
normalization	
of	
the	
PaCO2	
.	

In	
contrast	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
may	
worsen	
with	
oxygen	CHEMICAL

the

Developmental	
Issues	
Not	
known	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
etiology	
of	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
not	
completely	
understood	
.	

Although	
comorbid	DISEASE
OSA	DISEASE
is	
common	
,	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
are	
not	
entirely	
a	
function	
of	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
.	

The	
importance	
of	
various	
factors	
leading	
to	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
likely	
varies	
among	
patients	
.	

It	
has	
been	
postulated	
that	
sustained	
nocturnal	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
results	
from	
the	
development	
of	
short	
(	
due	
to	
apnea	DISEASE
-	
hypopnea	DISEASE
)	
or	
longer	
(	
secondary	
to	
hypoven-	
tilation	
)	
periods	
of	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
accompanied	
by	
inadequate	
compensation	
(	
i.e.	
,	
CO2	CHEMICAL
unloading	
)	
during	
periods	
of	
ventilation	
between	
obstructive	
events	
.	

Abnormal	
venti-	
latory	
control	
(	
blunted	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
response	
)	
allows	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
to	
persist	
into	
wakefulness	
after	
the	
cause	
of	
acute	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
is	
no	
longer	
present	
.	

A	
chronic	
hypercapnic	
state	
would	
produce	
an	
elevation	
of	
bicarbonate	CHEMICAL
.	

Although	
this	
blunts	
the	
degree	
of	
acidosis	DISEASE
due	
to	
an	
elevated	
PaCO2	
,	
it	
reduces	
the	
compensatory	
CO2	
ventilatory	
response	
.	

Impaired	DISEASE
renal	DISEASE
bicarbonate	DISEASE
excretion	DISEASE
rate	
,	
as	
seen	
in	
hypoxia	DISEASE
,	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
or	
diuretic	
-	
related	
chloride	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
,	
may	
contribute	
to	
the	
persistence	
of	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
.	

Obesity	DISEASE
itself	
is	
also	
associated	
with	
several	
factors	
that	
predispose	
to	
CO2	CHEMICAL
retention	
.	

Obesity	DISEASE
itself	
increases	
CO2	CHEMICAL
production	
.	

There	
is	
an	
increased	
work	
of	
breathing	
due	
to	
mass	
loading	
from	
the	
additional	
weight	
on	
the	
respiratory	
pump	
as	
well	
as	
resistive	
loading	
due	
to	
intermittent	
upper	
airway	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
.	

Numerous	
factors	
impair	
CO2	CHEMICAL
elimination	
including	
altered	
lung	
volumes	
and	
mechan-	
ics	
,	
ventilation	
-	
perfusion	
abnormalities	
secondary	
to	
atelectasis	DISEASE
or	
pulmonary	
conges-	
tion	
,	
reduced	
chemosensitivity	DISEASE
and	
load	
responsiveness	
,	
and	
suppression	
of	
respiratory	
drive	
due	
to	
obesity	DISEASE
-	
related	
humoral	
factors	
,	
such	
as	
resistance	
to	
the	
elevated	
leptin	
levels	
that	
occur	
in	
patients	
with	
the	
OHS	
(	
leptin	
is	
a	
respiratory	
stimulant	
)	
.	

The	
impor-	
tance	
of	
these	
factors	
likely	
varies	
from	
patient	
to	
patient	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Arterial	
blood	
gas	
testing	
during	
wakefulness	
shows	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
often	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
in	
untreated	
patients	
.	

Even	
with	
effective	
treatment	
most	
OHS	
patients	
continue	
to	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
exhibit	
some	
degree	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

The	
characteristic	
polysomnographic	
finding	
is	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
and	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
during	
sleep	
with	
or	
without	
obstructive	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	DISEASE
.	

Worsening	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
can	
be	
documented	
by	
an	
arterial	
blood	
gas	
measurement	
of	
PaCO2	
during	
sleep	
(	
rarely	
performed	
)	
or	
transcutaneous	
or	
end	
-	
tidal	
PCO2	
measurements	
.	

Periods	
of	
decreased	
tidal	
volume	
lasting	
up	
to	
several	
minutes	
with	
sustained	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
are	
usually	
present	
.	

Intermittent	
arousals	DISEASE
may	
be	
observed	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
is	
present	
in	
the	
majority	
of	
OHS	
patients	
,	
during	
at	
least	
a	
portion	
of	
the	
night	
.	

The	
transient	
ven-	
tilation	
between	
obstructive	
events	
(	
even	
if	
associated	
with	
arousal	
from	
the	
preceding	
obstructive	
event	
)	
is	
not	
sufficient	
to	
prevent	
worsening	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
.	

Severe	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
the	
obstructive	
events	
.	

Chronic	
hypoxia	DISEASE
can	
be	
associated	
with	
polycythemia	DISEASE
.	

Electrocardiography	
,	
chest	
radi-	
ography	
,	
and	
echocardiography	
may	
demonstrate	
evidence	
of	
pulmonary	DISEASE
hypertension	DISEASE
.	

The	
serum	
bicarbonate	CHEMICAL
level	
is	
usually	
elevated	
due	
to	
renal	
compensation	
for	
chronic	
respiratory	DISEASE
acidosis	DISEASE
(	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
)	
.	

In	
one	
study	
,	
a	
serum	
bicarbonate	CHEMICAL
level	
threshold	
>	
27	
mEq	
/	
L	
had	
a	
sensitivity	
of	
92	
%	
and	
a	
specificity	
of	
50	
%	
of	
identifying	
OHS	
in	
obese	
patients	
suspected	
of	
having	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

This	
suggests	
that	
the	
serum	
bicarbonate	CHEMICAL
level	
may	
be	
useful	
to	
screen	
patients	
for	
possible	
OHS	
.	

However	
,	
an	
arterial	
blood	
gas	
is	
required	
for	
diagnosis	
of	
OHS	
,	
as	
the	
serum	
bicarbonate	CHEMICAL
level	
may	
be	
elevated	
due	
to	
metabolic	
alkalosis	DISEASE
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
differential	
diagnosis	
includes	
any	
disorder	
that	
can	
give	
rise	
to	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
during	
wakefulness	
and	
sleep	
.	

This	
includes	
pulmonary	
airway	
and	
parenchymal	
dis-	
orders	
,	
pulmonary	
vascular	
pathology	
,	
neuromuscular	
and	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
severe	
untreated	
hypothyroidism	DISEASE
,	
use	
of	
respiratory	DISEASE
suppressants	DISEASE
,	
and	
congenital	
or	
idio-	
pathic	
central	
alveolar	
hypoventilation	
syndromes	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	CHEMICAL
syndromes	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
by	
the	
periodic	
alterations	
in	
airflow	
and	
accompanying	
periodic	
fluctuations	
in	
SaO2	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
due	
to	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
generally	
more	
sustained	
,	
usually	
several	
minutes	
or	
longer	
in	
duration	
.	

When	
more	
than	
one	
disorder	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
responsible	
for	
the	
ventilatory	DISEASE
insufficiency	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
,	
all	
pertinent	
diagnoses	
should	
be	
coded	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
Future	
research	
into	
the	
pathogenesis	
of	
this	
disorder	
,	
including	
renal	
bicarbonate	CHEMICAL
homeostasis	
,	
is	
needed	
.	

Because	
it	
is	
clinically	
impractical	
to	
routinely	
obtain	
arterial	
blood	
samples	
during	
sleep	
in	
most	
persons	
suspected	
of	
this	
disorder	
,	
other	
techniques	
of	
measuring	
CO2	CHEMICAL
levels	
must	
be	
investigated	
.	

The	
degree	
and	
duration	
of	
hypercapnia/	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
necessary	
to	
produce	
adverse	
consequences	
,	
such	
as	
pulmonary	
hyperten-	
sion	
,	
in	
individual	
patients	
is	
not	
well	
defined	
.	

Little	
information	
is	
available	
regarding	
the	
effect	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
therapy	
or	
noninvasive	
ventilation	
on	
the	
course	
of	
the	
underlying	
disease	
.	

Studies	
are	
needed	
to	
determine	
the	
optimal	
time	
to	
initiate	
these	
interventions	
and	
the	
specific	
subpopulations	
of	
patients	
who	
will	
benefit	
most	
from	
these	
therapies

Congenital	
central	
alveolar	
hypoventilation	
syndrome	
(	
CCHS	
)	
is	
a	
syndrome	
of	
auto-	
nomic	
dysfunction	
,	
primarily	
the	
failure	
of	
automatic	
central	
control	
of	
breathing	
,	
due	
to	
a	
mutation	
of	
the	
PHOX2B	DISEASE
gene	
.	

CCHS	
is	
characterized	
by	
the	
onset	
of	
hypoven-	
tilation	
,	
usually	
at	
birth	
.	

The	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
worse	
during	
sleep	
than	
wakefulness	
and	
is	
unexplained	
by	
primary	
pulmonary	
,	
neurological	
,	
or	
metabolic	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
.	

CCHS	
typically	
presents	
in	
an	
otherwise	
normal	
-	
appearing	
infant	
who	
is	
noted	
to	
have	
cyano-	
sis	
,	
feeding	
difficulties	
,	
hypotonia	DISEASE
or	
,	
less	
commonly	
,	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
.	

Some	
children	
are	
diagnosed	
following	
cardiovascular	
collapse	
.	

The	
infant	
requires	
intubation	
and	
then	
can	
not	
be	
weaned	
from	
mechanically	
assisted	
ventilation	
,	
despite	
appearing	
vigorous	
and	
having	
a	
normal	
chest	
radiograph	
.	

Some	
infants	
may	
appear	
to	
breathe	
adequately	
on	
clinical	
examination	
but	
experience	
episodes	
of	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
(	
not	
necessarily	
apnea	DISEASE
)	
characterized	
by	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
CCHS	
may	
occa-	
sionally	
present	
later	
in	
life	
with	
cyanosis	DISEASE
,	
an	
apparent	
life	
-	
threatening	
event	
,	
cor	
pul-	
monale	
,	
or	
hypoxic	DISEASE
neurological	DISEASE
damage	DISEASE
.	

CCHS	
has	
been	
diagnosed	
in	
adults	
who	
present	
with	
respiratory	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
following	
anesthesia	
or	
in	
association	
with	
a	
minor	
respiratory	DISEASE
illness	DISEASE
;	
these	
patients	
usually	
have	
a	
mild	
mutation	
,	
and	
may	
have	
evidence	
of	
longstanding	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
including	
cognitive	DISEASE
deficits	DISEASE
.	

Most	
patients	
with	
CCHS	
have	
sufficiently	
severe	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
that	
they	
require	
mechanically	
assisted	
ventilation	
,	
although	
this	
state	
-	
dependent	
difference	
may	
not	
be	
apparent	
during	
early	
infancy	
.	

Some	
patients	
(	
~15	
%	
)	
hypoventilate	
during	
wakefulness	
as	
well	
as	
during	
sleep	
and	
require	
continuous	
ventilatory	
support	
.	

However	
,	
most	
patients	
with	
CCHS	
do	
not	
require	
ventilatory	
support	
during	
wakefulness	
but	
may	
have	
subtle	
abnormali-	
ties	
in	
gas	
exchange	
when	
physically	
inactive	
or	
during	
vigorous	
exercise	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Associated	
autonomic	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
include	
Hirschsprung	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
in	
approximately	
16	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
CCHS	
,	
autonomic	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
decreased	
heart	
rate	
variabil-	
ity	
or	
hypotension	DISEASE
)	
,	
neural	
tumors	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
ganglioneuromas	DISEASE
or	
ganglioneuroblastomas	
)	
,	
swallowing	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
during	
the	
early	
years	
,	
and	
ocular	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
stra-	
bismus	CHEMICAL
)	
.	

Most	
patients	
are	
cognitively	
normal	
,	
although	
developmental	
delay	
may	
be	
present	
,	
especially	
in	
patients	
in	
whom	
the	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
has	
not	
been	
well	
controlled	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Research	
suggests	
that	
severity	
of	
illness	DISEASE
is	
related	
to	
the	
type	
of	
mutation	
present	
.	

Most	
patients	
have	
a	
polyalanine	
expansion	
mutation	
;	
those	
with	
more	
polyalanine	
repeats	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
have	
severe	
disease	
including	
waking	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
a	
point	
mutation	
or	
frame	
shift	
mutations	
are	
at	
greater	
risk	
for	
neural	
tumors	DISEASE
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
of	
CCHS	
is	
not	
known	
,	
but	
the	
disease	
is	
rare	
.	

The	
condition	
occurs	
equally	
among	
both	
sexes	
and	
all	
ethnic	
/	
racial	
groups	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
This	
is	
a	
congenital	DISEASE
genetic	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
CCHS	
usually	
occurs	
as	
a	
de	
novo	
mutation	
,	
but	
siblings	
with	
the	
condition	
have	
been	
reported	
.	

As	
the	
gene	
is	
dominant	
,	
patients	
are	
at	
risk	
of	
having	
children	
with	
CCHS	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	

The	
condition	
is	
genetic	
and	
is	
therefore	
present	
from	
birth	
,	
but	
some	
patients	
may	
present	
later	
in	
life	
.	

The	
physiological	
abnormalities	
of	
CCHS	
persist	
for	
life	
and	
are	
not	
ameliorated	
over	
time	
.	

However	
,	
the	
clinical	
consequences	
of	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
can	
be	
prevented	
by	
providing	
adequate	
ventilatory	
support	
.	

If	
untreated	
,	
death	DISEASE
usually	
results	
from	
cor	DISEASE
pulmonale	DISEASE
or	
complications	
of	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
severe	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
poorly	
controlled	
CCHS	
may	
develop	
mental	DISEASE
retardation	DISEASE
,	
growth	
failure	
,	
seizures	DISEASE
,	
or	
cor	DISEASE
pulmonale	DISEASE
.	

When	
treated	
,	
infants	
with	
CCHS	
may	
improve	
over	
the	
first	
six	
to	
12	
months	
.	

Some	
patients	
who	
initially	
require	
ventilatory	
support	
24	
hours	
a	
day	
may	
progress	
to	
adequate	
ventilation	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

However	
,	
patients	
continue	
to	
require	
ventilatory	
support	
during	
sleep	
.	

Conversely	
,	
some	
patients	
may	
develop	
the	
need	
for	
continuous	
ventilatory	
support	
.	

It	
is	
unclear	
whether	
these	
patients	
had	
condi-	
tions	
that	
worsened	
,	
were	
not	
adequately	
evaluated	
and	
treated	
initially	
,	
or	
were	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
changing	
ventilatory	
demands	
.	

Even	
with	
treatment	
,	
patients	
with	
CCHS	
require	
close	
monitoring	
,	
particularly	
during	
infancy	
.	

Minor	
medical	
illnesses	
,	
such	
as	
upper	DISEASE
respiratory	DISEASE
tract	DISEASE
illnesses	DISEASE
or	
diarrhea	DISEASE
,	
may	
precipitate	
bouts	
of	
respiratory	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

Edema	DISEASE
and	
lethargy	DISEASE
are	
often	
early	
signs	
of	
impending	
respiratory	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

The	
clinical	
signs	
of	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
and	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
in	
these	
patients	
may	
be	
subtle	
,	
as	
the	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Breathing	
Disorders	
children	
do	
not	
show	
signs

distress	
or	
increased	
work	
of

,	
such	
as	
retrac-	
tions	
and	
nasal

.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
gas	
exchange	
abnormalities	
may	
progress	
for	
some	
time	
without	
notice	
until	
the	
child	
appears	
to	
deteriorate	
suddenly	
with	
cardiopulmo-

applicable	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
exact	
pathophysiology	
of	
CCHS	
is	
unknown	
.	

Radiologic	
and	
postmortem	
studies	
have	
not	
shown	
gross	
central	
nervous	
system	
abnormalities	
.	

The	
PHOX2B	DISEASE
gene	
plays	
a	
role	
in	
the	
development	
of	
the	
autonomic	
system	
.	

Functional	
MRI	
and	
physiologic	
studies	
have	
shown	
widespread	
cerebral	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
in	
response	
to	
stimuli	
such	
as	
exogenous	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Hypoxemia	DISEASE
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
are	
present	
on	
PSG	
during	
sleep	
.	

Central	
apneas	
may	
be	
present	
,	
but	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
associated	
with	
decreased	
tidal	
volume	
and	
respiratory	
rate	
is	
more	
common	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
most	
types	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disordered	DISEASE
breathing	DISEASE
in	
children	
,	
abnormalities	
may	
be	
more	
severe	
during	
NREM	
than	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Patients	
may	
not	
arouse	
from	
sleep	
despite	
severe	
gas	
exchange	
abnormalities	
.	

Paradoxical	
breath-	
ing	
and	
snoring	DISEASE
do	
not	
typically	
occur	
.	

Patients	
with	
CCHS	
have	
flat	
rebreathing	
hypoxic	
and	
hypercapnic	
responses	
,	
although	
they	
may	
respond	
to	
transient	
ventilatory	
challenges	
of	
the	
peripheral	
chemorecep-	
tors	
.	

Arterial	
blood	
gases	
may	
be	
normal	
during	
wakefulness	
but	
will	
be	
abnormal	
if	
obtained	
from	
an	
arterial	
line	
during	
sleep	
.	

In	
patients	
with	
chronically	
untreated	
or	
poorly	
controlled	
CCHS	
,	
a	
compensated	
respiratory	DISEASE
acidosis	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
.	

In	
these	
patients	
,	
polycythemia	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
and	
the	
serum	
bicarbonate	CHEMICAL
level	
may	
be	
elevated	
.	

Computed	
tomography	
and	
MRI	
scans	
of	
the	
head	
are	
normal	
.	

Electrocardiography	
,	
echocardiography	
,	
or	
cardiac	
catheterization	
may	
reveal	
evidence	
of	
pulmonary	
hyper-	
tension	
.	

Pulmonary	
function	
tests	
may	
be	
normal	
or	
show	
evidence	
of	
mild	
obstructive	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
restrictive	DISEASE
lung	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
resulting	
from	
associated	
conditions	
such	
as	
tracheitis	DISEASE
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
CCHS	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
forms	
of	
central	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
,	
such	
as	
central	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
due	
to	
Chiari	DISEASE
malformation	DISEASE
,	
other	
causes	
of	
central	
nervous	
system	
disturbance	
such	
as	
trauma	DISEASE
or	
tumors	DISEASE
,	
metabolic	
conditions	
such	
as	
Leigh	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
or	
obesity	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
.	

CCHS	
must	
also	
be	
distinguished	
from	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
secondary	
to	
muscle	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
due	
to	
conditions	
such	
as	
diaphrag-	
matic	
paralysis	DISEASE
or	
muscular	DISEASE
dystrophy	DISEASE
.	

Infants	
presenting	
with	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
an	
apparent	
life	
-	
threatening	
event	
due	
to	
causes	
such	
as	
gastroesophageal	DISEASE
reflux	DISEASE
may	
be	
thought	
to	
have	
CCHS	
.	

However	
,	
these	
infants	
typically	
have	
intermittent	
episodes	
of	
apnea	DISEASE
rather	
than	
sustained	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
,	
and	
the	
episodes	
typically	
resolve	
once	
the	
primary	
cause	
has	
been	
treated	
.	

CCHS	
patients	
presenting	
with	
cor	DISEASE
pulmonale	DISEASE
may	
be	
misdiagnosed	
as	
having	
congenital	DISEASE

Essential	
Features	
Late

onset	
central	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
with	
hypothalamic	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
is	
a	
disorder	
of	
central	
control	
of	
ventilation	
.	

Patients	
are	
usually	
healthy	
until	
early	
childhood	
(	
often	
2	
-	
3	
years	
of	
age	
)	
when	
they	
develop	
hyperphagia	DISEASE
and	
severe	
obesity	DISEASE
,	
followed	
by	
central	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
,	
which	
often	
presents	
as	
respiratory	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
.	

The	
respiratory	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
may	
be	
precipitated	
by	
a	
mild	
respiratory	DISEASE
illness	DISEASE
or	
anesthesia	
.	

Patients	
require	
ventilatory	
support	
during	
sleep	
;	
most	
patients	
breathe	
adequately	
during	
wakefulness	
but	
some

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The

can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
late	
presentation	
of	
congenital	
central	
hypoven-	
tilation	
syndrome	
by	
testing	
for	
the	
PHOX2B	DISEASE
gene	
.	

Genetic	
testing	
may	
also	
be	
useful	
in	
distinguishing	
the	
disorder	
from	
Prader	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
Willi	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
which	
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
known	
genetic	
abnormality	
.	

Most	
children	
with	
Prader	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
Willi	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
have	
hypotonia	DISEASE
at	
birth	
and	
more	
severe	
developmental	
delay	
.	

The	
disorder	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
obesity	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
by	
the	
presence	
of	
endocrine	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
and	
other	
associated	
hypothalamic	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
,	
and	
by	
the	
persistence	
of	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
despite	
weight	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
patients	
typically	
have	
a	
totally	
flat	
hypercapnic	
ventilatory	
response	
rather	
than	
the	
blunted	
response	
seen	
in	
children	
with	
obesity	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
.	

The	
disorder	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
isolated	
hypopituitarism	DISEASE
or	
other	
hypothalamic	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
without	
hypoventilation	DISEASE

Notes	
.	

The	
predominant	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
one	
of	
reduced	
tidal	
volume	
or	
ataxic	
breathing	
with	
associated	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
.	

Although	
OSA	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
,	
it	
is	
not	
believed	
to	
be	
the	
major	
cause	
of	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

When	
criteria	
are	
met	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
both	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
idiopathic	
central	
alveolar	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
may	
be	
made	
.	
.	

Arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
is	
often	
present	
but	
is	
not	
required	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Idiopathic	
central	
alveolar	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
defined	
as	
the	
presence	
of	
decreased	
alve-	
olar	
ventilation	
resulting	
in	
sleep	
related	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
in	
individuals	
with	
presumed	
normal	
mechanical	
properties	
of	
the	
lung	
and	
respiratory	
pump	
.	

Thus	
,	
chronic	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
exists	
without	
any	
readily	
identifiable	
impairments	
of	
res-	
piration	
,	
such	
as	
pulmonary	
airway	
or	
parenchymal	
conditions	
,	
neurologic	
,	
neuromus-	
cular	
or	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
,	
severe	
obesity	DISEASE
,	
other	
sleep	
related	
breathing	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
or	
use	
of	
respiratory	
depressant	
medications	
or	
substances	
.	

Diurnal	
as	
well	
as	
nocturnal	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
primarily	
to	
blunted	
chemoresponsiveness	
to	
CO2	CHEMICAL
and	
O2	CHEMICAL
.	CHEMICAL

However	
,	
reported	
cases	
are	
few	
and

detail	
to	
conclu-	
sively	
establish	
a	
well

etiology

Alternatively	
,	
these	
cases	
may	
represent	
a	
mixed	
group	
of	
patients

The

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
etiology	
of	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
in	
these

is	
not	
understood	
.	

Chronic	
hyper-	
capnia	
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
in	
idiopathic	DISEASE
central	DISEASE
alveolar	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
to	
defective	
CO2	CHEMICAL
and	
O2	CHEMICAL
homeostasis	CHEMICAL
,	
with	
impaired	
CO2	CHEMICAL
unloading	
,	
reduced	
chemoresponsiveness	
to	
CO2	CHEMICAL
and	
O2	CHEMICAL
,	CHEMICAL
and	
suppression	
of	
respiratory	
drive	
.	

Imaging	
of	
the	
central	
nervous	
system	
does	
not	
document	
a	
structural	
defect	
.	

Hypoventilation	DISEASE
worsens	
during	
sleep	
compared	
to	
waking	
levels	
due	
to	
a	
further	
reduction	
in	
che-	
mosensitivity	
and	
decreased	
activity	
of	
the	
ventilatory	
muscles	
.	

Additionally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
,	
if	
sufficiently	
severe	
,	
may	
place	
the	
patient	
near	
or	
on	
the	
steep	
portion	
of	
the	
oxyhemoglobin	
dissociation	
curve	
where	
even	
relatively	
small	
decrements	
in	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
tension	
result	
in	
large	
decrements	
in	
oxyhemoglobin	
saturation	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
in	
these	
patients	
may	
have	
a	
relatively	
great	
impact	
on	
oxyhemoglobin

excluded	
medical

with	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
before	
a

Although	
OSA	DISEASE
or	
CSA	CHEMICAL
may	
be	
present	
,	
they	
are	
not	
believed	
to	
be	
the	
major	
cause	
of	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

The	
predominant	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
one	
of	
reduced	
tidal

or	
ataxic	
breathing	
and	
associated	
arterial

due	
to	
medication	
or

as	
well	
as	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or

.	

Arterial

.	

Hypoventilation	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
during	
wakefulness	
but	
is	
not

the	
diagnosis	
.	

Essential	
Features	

This	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
primarily	
by	
chronic	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
prolonged	
use	
of	
medications	
or	
substances	
known	
to	
depress	
ventilatory	
drive	
and/or	
impair	
respiratory	
muscle	
mechanics	
.	

These	
agents	
include	
long	
-	
acting	
nar-	
cotics	
,	
anesthetics	
,	
sedative	
compounds	
,	
and	
muscle	
relaxants	
.	

The	
risk	
of	
respiratory	DISEASE
insufficiency	DISEASE
is	
increased	
with	
the	
concomitant	
use	
of	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
or	
with	
polypharmacy	
.	

Respiratory	DISEASE
depressants	DISEASE
can	
precipitate	
respiratory	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
in	
patients	
with	
limited	
pul-	
monary	
reserves	
or	
exacerbate	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
in	
those	
with	
baseline	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
.	

Hypoxemia	DISEASE
is	
commonly	
present	
and	
can	
show	
either	
a	
sustained	
reduction	
or	
episodic	
fluctuations	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
present	
.	

Hypercapnia	DISEASE
may	
also	
be	
present	
during	
wakefulness	
in	
some	
patients	
.	

Patients	
can	
either	
be	
asymptomatic	
or	
present	
with	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
dyspnea	DISEASE
,	
chest	DISEASE
tightness	DISEASE
,	
or	
fatigue	DISEASE
.	

Neurocognitive	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
may	
arise	
following	
use	
of	
narcotics	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Medications	
and	
substances	
that	
reduce	
respiratory	
drive	
may	
also	
alter	
the	
mechanics	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
.	

By	
decreasing	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
,	
these	
agents	
may	
pre-	
cipitate	
or	
exacerbate	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	
.	

It	
is	
not	
currently	
known	
whether	
chronic	
use	
of	
respiratory	DISEASE
depressants	DISEASE
will	
eventually	
give	
rise	
to	
pulmonary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
hypertension	DISEASE
or	
cor	DISEASE
pulmonale	DISEASE
,	
but	
this	
seems	
unlikely	
.

Individuals	
with	
chronic

during	
wakefulness	
will	
expe-	
rience	
even	
greater	
decrements	
of	
alveolar	
ventilation	
during	
sleep	
.	

Studies	
of	
patients	
on	
methadone	CHEMICAL
maintenance	
have	
generally	
found	
no	
or	
mild	
daytime	DISEASE
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

There	
is	
scant	
literature	
about	
daytime	
or	
nocturnal	
PaCO2	
in	
patients	
on	
potent	
opioids

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
use	
of	
medications	
or	
substances	
that	
impair	
respiration	
mechanics	
or	
drive	
is	
the	
primary	
pathophysiologic	
factor	
responsible	
for	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

There	
are	
significant	
inter	
-	
individual	
differences	
in	
sensitivity	
and	
tolerance	
to	
respira-	
tory	
depressants	
.	

Obesity	DISEASE
or	
the	
presence	
of	
medical	
and	
neurologic	
diseases	
that	
may	
produce	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
may	
further	
worsen	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
/	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
who	
are	
hypercapnic	
and	
hypoxemic	
during	
wakefulness	
will	
generally	
become	
even	
more	
so	
during	
sleep	
,	
in	
particular	
REM	
sleep	
,	
but	
the	
relationship	
between	
wake	
SaO2/	
PaCO2	
and	
sleep

desaturation	DISEASE
is	
not	
sufficiently	
strong	
to	
have

or	
as	
a

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
a	
direct	
result	
of	
impaired	
respiratory	
drive	
and	
CO2	CHEMICAL
and	
O2	CHEMICAL
chemo-	CHEMICAL
sensitivity	
.	

Hypoventilation	DISEASE
worsens	
during	
sleep	
,	
especially	
in	
REM	
sleep	
,	
compared	
to	
waking	
levels	
,	
due	
to	
a	
further	
reduction	
in	
chemosensitivity	
and	
decreased	
activity	
of	
the	
ventilatory	
muscles	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
use	
of	
respiratory	DISEASE
suppressants	DISEASE
may	
give	
rise	
to	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	
that	
may	
contribute	
to	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	

The	
characteristic	
PSG	
finding	
is	
demonstration	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
by	
monitoring	
of	
PaCO2	
or	
acceptable	
surrogate	
during	
sleep	
.	

Sustained	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desat-	
uration	
during	
sleep	
that	
is	
unexplained	
by	
discrete	
apnea	DISEASE
and	
hypopnea	DISEASE
events	
is	
common	
.	

However	
,	
this	
finding	
alone	
is	
not	
sufficient	
to	
make	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Medication	
use	
can	
also	
produce	
obstructive	DISEASE
or	
central	
apneas	
.	

Intermittent	
arousals	DISEASE
associated	
with	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
may	
be	
observed	
.	

An	
ataxic	
breathing	
pattern	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
differential	
diagnosis	
encompasses	
essentially	
all	
disorders	
that	
can	
lead	
to	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
.	

This	
includes	
OHS	
,	
pulmonary	
airway	
and	
parenchy-	
mal	
disorders	
,	
pulmonary	
vascular	
pathology	
,	
neuromuscular	
and	
chest	
wall	
disor-	
ders	
,	
severe	
untreated	
hypothyroidism	DISEASE
,	
and	
congenital	
or	
idiopathic	
central	
alveo-	
lar	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
syndromes	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	CHEMICAL
syndromes	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
by	
the	
periodic	
alterations	
in	
airflow	
and	
accompanying	
periodic	
fluctuations	
in	
SaO2	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
due	
to	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
generally	
more	
sustained	
,	
usually	
several	
minutes	
or	
longer	
in	
dura-	
tion	
.	

When	
more	
than	
one	
disorder	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
responsible	
for	
the	
ventilatory	DISEASE
insufficiency	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
,	
all	
pertinent	
diagnoses	
should	
be	
coded	
.	

Unresolved

The	
long	
-	
term	
con-	
sequences	
of	
chronic	
use	
of	
respiratory	DISEASE
depressants	DISEASE
are	
poorly	
understood	
.	

The	
value	
of	
routinely	
measuring	
PaCO2	
during	
sleep	
in	
patients	
taking	
respiratory	
depressants	
is	
not	
clear	
.	

Additionally	
,	
because	
it	
is	
clinically	
impractical	
to	
routinely	
obtain	
arterial	
blood	
samples	
during	
sleep	
in	
most	
persons	
suspected	
of	
this	
disorder	
,	
other	
techniques	
of	
measuring	
CO2	CHEMICAL
levels	
must	
be	
investigated	
.	

Little	
information	
is

regarding	
the

Some	
of

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	

The	
clinical	
presentation	
varies	
with	
the	
underlying	
disorder	
responsible	
for	
the	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Chronic	DISEASE
obstructive	DISEASE
pulmonary	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
generally	
fixed	
and	
not	
fully	
reversible	
lower	
airways	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
,	
and	
includes	
chronic	
bronchitis	DISEASE
,	
emphysema	DISEASE
,	
cystic	
fibrosis	DISEASE
,	
and	
bronchiectasis	DISEASE
.	

Chronic	
bron-	
chitis	
is	
a	
clinical	
entity	
defined	
by	
the	
presence	
of	
chronic	
productive	
cough	DISEASE
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
of	
the	
year	
,	
for	
at	
least	
two	
consecutive	
years	
,	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
other	
identifiable	
etiologies	
.	

Emphysema	
is	
characterized	
by	
destruction	
of	
lung	
tissue	
and	
the	
dilation	
of	
peripheral	
airspaces	
without	
evident	
fibrosis	DISEASE
.	

Emphysema	
and	
chronic	
bronchitis	DISEASE
often	
coexist	
.	

Alpha-1	
antitrypsin	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
is	
a	
genetic	
cause	
of	
chronic	DISEASE
obstructive	DISEASE
pulmonary	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
.	

Both	
bronchiectasis	DISEASE
and	
cystic	
fibrosis	DISEASE
are	
characterized	
by	
lower	
airway	DISEASE
inflammation	DISEASE
and	
destruction	
of	
airways	
and	
lung	
parenchyma	
.	

Patients	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
lower	DISEASE
airways	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
are	
increasingly	
predis-	
posed	
to	
developing	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
as	
the	
severity	
of	
the	
underlying	
lower	
airways	DISEASE
obstruction	DISEASE
increases	
.	

Parenchymal	DISEASE

disease	DISEASE
associated	
with	
restrictive	
ventilatory	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
interstitial	DISEASE
lung	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
)	
can	
also	
be	
associated	
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Neurologic	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
neuromuscular	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
can	
produce	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
due	
to	
an	
abnormal	
ventilatory	
pump	
(	
secondary	
to	
reduced	
muscle	
strength	
or	
anatomic	
distortion	
of	
the	
chest	
wall	
structures	
)	
that	
is	
unable	
to	
meet	
the	
ventilatory	
require-	
ments	
for	
maintaining	
PaCO2	
at	
or	
below	
45	
mm	
Hg	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
some	
of	
these	
patients	
have	
reduced	
central	
neural	
chemoresponsiveness	
.

Demographics	
The	
demographics	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disorder	
are	
a	
function	
of	
the	
prevalence	
,	
clinical	
characteristics	
,	
and	
degree	
of	
severity	
of	
the	
under-	
lying	
conditions	
.	

Thus	
,	
prevalence	
may	
be	
higher	
in	
patients	
with	
greater	
perturbations	
of	
pulmonary	
function	
or	
neuromuscular	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
.	

Individuals	
with	
chronic	
hyper-	
capnia	
during	
wakefulness	
will	
experience	
even	
greater	
decrements	
of	
alveolar	
venti-	
lation	
during	
sleep	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Greater	
impairments	
of	
respiratory	
function	
are	
associated	
with	
greater	
risk	
for	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
there	
is	
no	
recognized	
threshold	
of	
pulmonary	
parenchymal	
or	
vascular	
disease	
severity	
that	
adequately	
predicts	
the	
risk	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
in	
individual	
patients	
.	

Reduced	
chemosensitivity	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
in	
some	
neuromuscular	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

The	
use	
of	
central	
nervous	
system	
depressants	
,	
such	
as	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
,	
anxiolytics	
,	
and	
hypnotics	
,	
may	
further	
worsen	
respira-	
tory	
impairment	
.	

Patients	
who	
are	
hypercapnic	
and	
hypoxemic	
during	
wakefulness	
will	
generally	
become	
even	
more	
so	
during	
sleep	
,	
in	
particular	
REM	
sleep	
,	
but	
the	
rela-	
tionship	
between	
wake	
SaO2	
/	
PaCO2	
and	
sleep	
related	
desaturation	DISEASE
is	
not	
sufficiently	
strong	
to	
have	
substantial	
predictive	
value	
in	
individual	
patients	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Genetic	
patterns	
for	
many	
of	
the	
disorders	
are	
not	
known	
.	

Alpha-1	
antitrypsin	CHEMICAL
defi-	
ciency	
is	
a	
genetic	
disorder	
characterized	
by	
defective	
production	
of	
the	
enzyme	
inhib-	
itor	
;	
severe	
forms	
of	
deficiency	
can	
lead	
to	
emphysema	DISEASE
.	

Genetic	
causes	
of	
bronchi-	
ectasis	
include	
primary	
ciliary	
dyskinesia	DISEASE
and	
cystic	
fibrosis	DISEASE
.	

Muscular	DISEASE
dystrophies	DISEASE
are	
genetically	
inherited	
.	

The	
familial	
patterns	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
due	
to	
these	
disorders	
reflect	
those	
of	
the	
underlying	
inherited	
conditions	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
and	
course	
of	
the	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
parallels	
the	
presence	
and	
severity	
of	
the	
underlying	
medical	
or	
neurological	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
that	
impair	
respiration	
although	
substan-	
tial	
variability	
in	
course	
is	
observed	
even	
within	
the	
same	
underlying	
condition	
.	

Many	
affected	
individuals	
with	
severe	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
develop	
respiratory	DISEASE
impairment	DISEASE
,	
pulmonary	DISEASE
hypertension	DISEASE
,	
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
cardiac	DISEASE
arrhythmias	DISEASE
,	
and	
neurocog-	
nitive	
dysfunction	
.	

Polycythemia	DISEASE
is	
common	
in	
those	
with	
chronic	
hypoxia	DISEASE
.	

Although	
the	
risk	
of	
increased	
morbidity	
and	
mortality	
appears	
to	
increase	
with	
worsening	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
,	
the	
specific	
relationship	
between	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
and	
morbidity	
and	
mortality	
is	
not	
well	
defined	
.	

Many	
patients	
respond	
to	
assisted	
ven-	
tilation	
,	
whereas	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
may	
worsen	
with	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
therapy	
alone	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Pulmonary	
parenchymal	
diseases	
are	
characterized	
by	
altered	
lung	
volumes	
(	
e.g.	
,	
reduced	
functional	
residual	
capacity	
)	
and	
abnormal	
ventilation	
/	
perfusion	
relationships	
,	
which	
can	
result	
in	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Decreased	
lung	
volume	
is	
associated	
with	
reduced	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
reserves	
that	
increase	
the	
risk	
of	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
sleep	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
altered	
pattern	
of	
ventilatory	
-	
muscle	
acti-	
vation	
,	
particularly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
when	
,	
due	
to	
reduced	
activation	
of	
the	
intercos-	
tal	
and	
accessory	
muscles	
,	
there	
is	
a	
disproportionate	
ventilatory	
burden	
placed	
on	
the	
diaphragm	
.	

This	
may	
lead	
to	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
in	
patients	
with	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
or	
in	
those	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
obstructive	DISEASE
pulmonary	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
.	

In	
the	
latter	
,	
lung	
hyperinfla-	
tion	
creates	
a	
mechanical	
disadvantage	
to	
the	
diaphragm	
.	

Many	
neurologic	
and	
neu-	
romuscular	
disorders	
are	
associated	
with	
impaired	
respiratory	
mechanics	
and	
reduced	
CO2	CHEMICAL
chemosensitivity	
.	

Finally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
,	
if	
sufficiently	
severe	
,	
may	
place	
the	
patient	
near	
or	
on	
the	
steep	
portion	
of	
the	
oxyhemoglobin	
dissociation	
curve	
,	
where	
even	
relatively	
small	
decrements	
in	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
tension	
result	
in	
large	
decrements	
in	
oxyhemoglobin	
saturation	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
in	
these	
patients	
may	
have	
a	
relatively	
great	
impact	
on	
oxyhemoglobin	
saturation	
.	

Objective	
Findings	

The	
characteristic	
polysomnographic

oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
during	
sleep	
that	
is	
unexplained	
by	
discrete	
apnea	DISEASE
and	
hypopnea	DISEASE

is	
common	
but	
is	
not	
sufficient	
to	
establish	
a

of	
sleep

hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

Intermittent	
arousals	DISEASE
associated	
with	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
may	
be	
observed	
.	

Many	
medical	
and	
neurologic	
disorders	
are	
associated	
with	
significant	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbances	DISEASE
and	
changes	
in	
sleep	
architecture	
,	
including	
prolonged

reduced

,	
and	
decreased

may	
be	
present	
.	

Obstructive	DISEASE

,	
will	
further	
disturb	
sleep	
and	
accentuate	
sleep

.	

Daytime	
arterial	
blood

may	
be	
normal	
or	
show	
hypoxia	DISEASE
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE

Chronic	
hypoxia	DISEASE
(	
especially	
when	
present	
during	
the	
day	
as	
well	
as	
at	
night	
)	
can	
be	
associated	
with	
polycythemia	DISEASE
.	

Electrocardiography	
,	
chest	
radiography

may	
demonstrate

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
differential	
diagnosis	
includes	
all	
disorders	
which	
can	
give	
rise	
to	
hypoventila-	
tion	
during	
sleep	
.	

This	
includes	
OHS	
,	
use	
of	
medications	
or	
substances	
that	
can	
sup-	
press	
respiratory	
drive	
,	
and	
congenital	
or	
idiopathic	
central	
alveolar	
hypoventilation	
syndromes	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	CHEMICAL
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
by	
the	
periodic	
alterations	
in	
airflow	
and	
accompanying	
periodic	
fluctuations	
in	
SaO2	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
due	
to	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
generally	
more	
sustained	
,	
usually	
several	
minutes	
or	
longer	
in	
duration	
.	

When	
more	
than	
one	
disorder	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
responsible	
for	
the	
ventilatory	DISEASE
insufficiency	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
,	
all	
pertinent	
diagnoses	
should	
be	
coded	
.	

Unresolved

Directions	
Thresholds	
of	
impairments	
of	
ventilation	
and	
respiratory	
drive	
producing	
hypercapnia/	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
need	
to	
be	
identified	
.	

The	
degree	
and	
duration	
of	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
/	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
necessary	
to	
produce	
adverse	
consequences	
,	
such	
as	
pulmonary	DISEASE
hypertension	DISEASE
,	
in	
indi-	
vidual	
patients	
is	
not	
well	
defined	
.	

The	
value	
of	
routinely	
measuring	
PaCO2	
during	
sleep	
in	
these	
patients	
is	
not	
clear	
.	

Additionally	
,	
because	
it	
is	
clinically	
impractical	
to	
routinely	
obtain	
arterial	
blood	
samples	
during	
sleep	
in	
most	
persons	
suspected	
of	
this	
disorder	
,	
other	
techniques	
of	
measuring	
CO2	CHEMICAL
levels	
must	
be	
investigated	
.	

Little	
infor-	
mation	
is	
available	
regarding	
the	
effect	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
therapy	
or	
noninvasive	
ventilation	
on	
the	
course	
of	
the	
underlying	
disease	
.	

Studies	
are	
needed	
to	
determine	
the	
optimal	
time	
to	
initiate	
these	
interventions	
and	
the	
specific	
subpopulations	
of	
patients	
who	
will	
benefit	
most	
from	
these	
therapies

Essential	
Features	
Significant	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
is	
present	
and	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
secondary	
to	
a	
medical	
or	
neurological	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

The	
presence	
of	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
is	
not	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
sleep	
related	
breathing	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
OSA	DISEASE
)	
.	

Although	
some	
amount	
of	
obstructive	DISEASE
or	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
,	
these	
disorders	
are	
not	
thought	
to	
be	
pri-	
marily	
responsible	
for	
the	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
.	

Some	
patients	
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
also	
exhibit	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
has	
not	
been	
documented	
(	
if	
so	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
made	
)	
.	

The	
presentation	
of	
patients	
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
varies	
with	
the	
underly-	
ing	
medical	
or	
neurological	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Chronic	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
can	
arise	
from

parenchymal	DISEASE
pulmonary	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
pulmonary	DISEASE

,	
or

and	DISEASE
neuromuscular	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE

Acute	
exacerbations	
of	
respiratory	DISEASE

can	
accentuate	
the	
severity	
of	
hypoxemia	DISEASE

and	
other	
causes	
of	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
generally	
sustained	
(	
several	
minutes	
or	
longer	
)	
,	
whereas	
sawtooth	
fluctuations	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
(	
typically	
less	
than	
one	
minute	
)	
characterize	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
due	
to	
OSA	DISEASE
or	
CSA	CHEMICAL
.	

Patients	
can	
either	
be	
asymptomatic	
or	
present	
with

nocturnal	DISEASE
dyspnea	DISEASE
,	
impaired

,	
or

Polycythemia	DISEASE
is	
often	
noted	
with	
severe	
chronic	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

Associated	
Features	
Consequences	
of	
chronic	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
include	
pulmonary	
artery	
hyper-	
tension	
,	
cor	DISEASE
pulmonale	DISEASE
,	
and	
neurocognitive	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
.	

Some	
of	
the	
disorders	
causing	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
are	
prevalent	
diseases	
and	
not	
uncommonly	
overlap	
.	

Patients	
with	
multi-	
ple	
breathing	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
are	
likely	
to	
experience	
greater	
severity	
and	
duration	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
than	
are	
patients	
with	
a	
single	
disorder	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
Specific	
variations	
in	
the	
sleep	
related	
findings	
have	
not	
been	
described	
for	
the	
various	
etiologies	
.	

Demographics	
The	
demographics	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
are	
a	
function	
of	
the	
prevalence	
,	
clinical	
characteristics	
and	
degree	
of	
severity	
of	
the	
underlying	
conditions	
.	

Thus	
,	
prevalence	
may	
be	
higher	
in	
patients	
with	
greater	
perturbations	
of	
pulmonary	
function	
or	
neu-	
romuscular	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
.	

Individuals	
with	
chronic	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
during	
wakefulness	
will	
experience	
even	
greater	
decrements	
of	
oxygenation	
during	
sleep	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Greater	
impairments	
of	
respiratory	
function	
are	
associated	
with	
greater	
risk	
for	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
there	
is	
no	
recognized	
threshold	
of	
pulmonary	
paren-	
chymal	
or	
vascular	
disease	
severity	
or	
extent	
of	
neuromuscular	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
that	
ade-	

quately	
predicts	
the	
risk	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
in	
individual	
patients	
.	

Patients	
who	
are	
hypoxemic	
during	
wakefulness	
will	
generally	
become	
even	
more	
so	
during	
sleep	
,	
especially	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Among	
the	
best	
predictors	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
are	
reduced	
baseline	
wake	
SaO2	
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
wake	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
should	
be	
suspected	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
the	
relationship	
between	
wake	
SaO2	
/	
PaCO2	
and	
sleep	
related	
desaturation	DISEASE
is	
not	
sufficiently	
strong	
to	
have	
substantial	
predictive	
value	
in	
individual	
patients

Alpha-1	
antitrypsin	CHEMICAL
defi-	
ciency	
is	
a	
genetic	
disorder	
characterized	
by	
defective	
production	
of	
the

severe

The

reflect	
those

although	
sub-	
stantial	
variability	
in

is	
observed	
even	
within	
the

Many

Polycythemia	DISEASE
is

in	
those

rates	
of

crises	
accompany	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
in

Although	
the	
risk	
of	
increased	
morbidity	
and	
mortality	
appears	
to	
increase	
with	
wors-	
ening	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
,	
the	
specific	
relationship	
between	
sleep	
related	
hypox-	
emia	CHEMICAL
and	
morbidity	
and	
mortality	
is	
not	
well	
defined	
.	

Many	
patients	
respond	
to	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
therapy	
;	
in	
some	
,	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
may	
worsen	
with	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
therapy	
alone	
for	
hypoxia	DISEASE
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Hypoxemia	DISEASE
may	
arise	
from	
a	
shunt	
physiology	
,	
ventilation	
-	
perfusion	
[	
V	
/	
Q	
]	
mismatch-	CHEMICAL
ing	
,	
low	
mixed	
venous	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
,	
and/or	
high	
altitude	
.	

Hypoventilation	DISEASE
also	
gives	
rise	
to	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
;	
however	
,	
when	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
has	
been	
documented	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
should	
be	
assigned	
,	
rather	
than	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

Pulmonary	DISEASE
parenchymal	DISEASE
diseases	DISEASE
are	
characterized	
by	
altered	
lung	
volumes	
(	
e.g.	
,	
reduced	
functional	
residual	
capacity	
)	
and	
abnormal	
ventilation	
/	
perfusion	
relationships	
,	
which	
can	
result	
in	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
and	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Decreased	
lung	
volume	
is	
associated	
with	
reduced	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
reserves	
that	
increase	
the	
risk	
of	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
sleep	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
altered	
pattern	
of	
ventilatory	
muscle	
acti-	
vation	
,	
particularly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
when	
,	
due	
to	
reduced	
activation	
of	
the	
intercos-	
tal	
and	
accessory	
muscles	
,	
there	
is	
a	
disproportionate	
ventilatory	
burden	
placed	
on	
the	
diaphragm	
.	

This	
may	
lead	
to	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
in	
patients	
with	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
or	
chronic	DISEASE
obstructive	DISEASE
pulmonary	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
.	

In	
the	
latter	
,	
lung	
hyperinflation	
creates	
a	
mechanical	
disadvantage	
to	
the	
diaphragm	
.	

In	
sickle	DISEASE
cell	DISEASE
anemia	DISEASE
,	
decreased	
oxyhemo-	
globin	
affinity	
may	
partly	
contribute	
to	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

Many	
neurologic	
and	
neuromuscu-	DISEASE
lar	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
are	
associated	
with	
impaired	
respiratory	
mechanics	
and	
reduced	
CO2	CHEMICAL
che-	
mosensitivity	
.	

Finally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
,	
if	
sufficiently	
severe	
,	
may	
place	
the	
patient	
near	
or	
on	
the	
steep	
portion	
of	
the	
oxyhemoglobin	
dissociation	
curve	
where	
even	
rela-	
tively	
small	
decrements	
in	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
tension	
result	
in	
large	
decrements	
in	
oxyhe-	
moglobin	
saturation	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
in	
these	
patients	
might	
have	
a	
relatively	
great	
impact	
on	
oxyhemoglobin	
saturation	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Various	
patterns	
of	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
(	
sustained	
,	
intermittent	
,	
or	
episodic	
)	
may	
be	
observed	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
diagnosis	
is	
generally	
made	
on	
the	
basis	
of	
overnight	
oxim-	
etry	
(	
alone	
or	
as	
a	
component	
of	
PSG	
or	
OCST	
)	
;	
less	
commonly	
,	
arterial	
blood	
gas	
mea-	
surements	
are	
indicated	
,	
especially	
if	
concomitant	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
is	
suspected	
.	

PSG	
may	
demonstrate	
normal	
sleep	
architecture	
or	
frequent	
arousals	DISEASE
,	
increased	
wakeful-	
ness	
after	
sleep	
onset	
and	
reduced	
sleep	
efficiency	
;	
however	
,	
the	
contribution	
of	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
to	
the	
altered	
sleep	
architecture	
,	
if	
present	
,	
is	
uncertain	
.	

Daytime	
arterial	
blood	
gases	
may	
be	
normal	
or	
show	
hypoxia	DISEASE
and	
hypercapnia	DISEASE
.	

Nocturnal	
oxim-	
etry	
usually	
shows	
sustained	
periods	
of	
reduced	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
but	
clusters	
of	
more	
severe	
drops	
in	
the	
arterial	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
can	
occur	
every	
one	
to	
two	
hours	
due	
to	
worsening	
of	
breathing	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

A	
sawtooth	
pattern	
of	
briefer	
desaturations	DISEASE
(	
typically	
less	
than	
one	
minute	
)	
suggests	
the	
presence	
of	
discrete	
events	
(	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	DISEASE
)	
.	

Some	
sawtooth	
changes	
may	
be	
superimposed	
on	
low	
baseline	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
saturation	
but	
are	
not	
the	
predominant	
pattern	
.	

Chronic	
hypoxia	DISEASE
can	
be	
associated	
with	
polycythemia	DISEASE
.	

Electrocardiography	
,	
chest	
radiography	
,	
and	
echocardiography	
may	
demonstrate	
evidence	
of	
pulmonary	DISEASE
hypertension	DISEASE
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
differential	
diagnosis	
encompasses	
all	
disorders	
which	
can	
give	
to	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
.	

This	
includes	
pulmonary	
airway	
and	
parenchymal	
disorders	
,	
pulmonary	
vascular	
pathology	
,	
neuromuscular	
and	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
OHS	
,	
use	
of	
medications	
or	
substances	
that	
can	
suppress	
respiratory	
drive	
,	
and	
congenital	
or	
idiopathic	
central	
alveolar	
hypoventilation	
syndromes	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
and	
CSA	CHEMICAL
syndromes	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
by	
the	
periodic	
alterations	
in	
airflow	
and	
accompanying	
periodic	
fluctuations	
in	
SaO2	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
desaturation	
associated	
with	
sleep	
related	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
is	
generally	
more	
sustained	
,	
usually	
several	
minutes	
or	
longer	
in	
duration	
.	

In	
cases	
when	
more	
than	
one	
disorder	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
responsible	
for	
the	
ventilatory	DISEASE
insufficiency	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
,	
all	
pertinent	
diagnoses	
should	
be	
coded	
.

Even	
less	
is	
under-

regarding	
the

and	
the

for	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
supplementation	
in	
patients	
with	
normal

Studies	
are	
needed

the

time	
to	
initiate	
oxygen	CHEMICAL

and	
the	
specific	
subpopulations

Snoring	DISEASE
is	
a	
respiratory	
sound	
generated	
in	
the	
upper	
airway	
during	
sleep	
that	
typically	
occurs	
during	
inspiration	
but	
may	
also	
occur	
in	
expiration	
;	
the	
snoring	DISEASE
described	
here	
occurs	
without	
episodes	
of	
apnea	DISEASE
,	
hypopnea	DISEASE
,	
RERAs	
or	
hypoventilation	DISEASE
.	

The	
intensity	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
may	
vary	
and	
often	
will	
disturb	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
and	
even	
awaken	
the	
patient	
.	

Snoring	DISEASE
in	
this	
context	
does	
not	
cause	
symptoms	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
or	
insomnia	DISEASE
in	
the	
patient	
.	

This	
type	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
has	
variously	
been	
referred	
to	
as	
habitual	
,	
primary	
or	
simple	
snoring	DISEASE
.	

Snoring	DISEASE
is	
a	
cardinal	
symptom	
of	
obstructive	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
.	

A	
designation	
of	
habitual	
snoring	DISEASE
can	
not	
be	
made	
in	
those	
who	
exhibit	
symptoms	
(	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
/	
fatigue	DISEASE
or	
other	
related	
symptoms	
)	
or	
report	
possible	
breathing	
pauses	
,	
without	
objective	
mea-	
surement	
of	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
those	
individuals	
with	
snoring	DISEASE
and	
comorbid	DISEASE
cardiovascular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
(	
especially	
pulmonary	
or	
systemic	
hypertension	DISEASE
,	
cor-	
onary	
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
or	
atrial	DISEASE
fibrillation	DISEASE
)	
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
the	
presence	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
complaints	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Therefore	
,	
PSG	
or	
OCST	
is	
required	
in	
order	
to	
effectively	
rule	
out	
OSA	DISEASE
in	
such	
populations	
.	

It	
should	
also	
be	
noted	
that	
patients	
who	
initially	
have	
isolated	
snoring	DISEASE
may	
be	
at	
risk	
for	
developing	
OSA	DISEASE
with	
aging	
or	
weight	DISEASE
gain	DISEASE
.	

Occasional	
snoring	DISEASE
is	
almost	
universal	
.	

Estimates	
on	
snoring	DISEASE
vary	
widely	
depending	
on	
its	
definition	
.	

The	
incidence	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
in	
children	
is	
reported	
to	
be	
10	
%	
to	
12	
%	
.	

The	
Wisconsin	
cohort	
study	
reports	
habitual	DISEASE
snoring	DISEASE
in	
about	
24	
%	
of	
adult	
women	
and	
40	
%	
of	
adult	
men	
.	

Prevalence	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
increases	
with	
age	
in	
both	
sexes	
,	
except	
that	
the	
prevalence	
of	
reported	
snoring	DISEASE
starts	
to	
decrease	
again	
in	
men	
after	
70	
years	
of	
age	
.	

Some	
have	
hypothesized	
that	
his	
may	
be	
due	
to	
decreased	DISEASE
hearing	DISEASE
acuity	DISEASE
in	
older	
individuals	
.	

Snoring	DISEASE
is	
most	
common	
in	
adult	
men	
and	
is	
also	
linked	
to	
obesity	DISEASE
.	

Nasal	
obstruc-	
tion	
increases	
the	
risk	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
.	

Ingestion	
of	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
,	
muscle	
relaxants	
,	
narcotics	
,	
or	
other	
substances	
that	
decrease	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
predisposes	
an	
individual	
to	
snoring	DISEASE
.	

Smoking	
,	
particularly	
in	
males	
,	
has	
also	
been	
shown	
to	
be	
a	
risk	
factor	
.	

Snoring	DISEASE
has	
also	
been	
shown	
to	
increase	
during	
pregnancy	
.	

In	
children	
,	
an	
association	
has	
been	
reported	
between	
snoring	DISEASE
and	
adenotonsillar	
hypertrophy	DISEASE
.	

During

Sleep

Breathing	
Disorders

there	
is	
vibration	
of	
the	
uvula	
and	
soft	
palate	DISEASE
,	
although	
it	
may	
also	
involve	
the	
faucial	
pillars	
,	
pharyngeal	
walls	
,	
and	
lower	
structures	
.	

Snorers	
have	
been	
shown	
to	
have	
mor-	
phologic	
derangements	
of	
the	
palate	DISEASE
consistent	
with	
neurogenic	DISEASE
lesions	DISEASE
.	

These	
are	
thought	
to	
be	
due	
to	
trauma	DISEASE
from	
vibration	
.	

If	
PSG	
is	
performed	
,	
snoring	DISEASE
tends	
to	
be	
loudest	
during	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
or	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Epidemiologic	
studies	
are	
difficult	
to	
interpret	
if	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
was	
not	
excluded	
by	
PSG	
.	

Based	
on	
the	
current	
literature	
,	
habitual	
snoring	DISEASE
in	
children	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
worse	
school	
performance	
,	
but	
conclusive	
evidence	
for	
this	
is	
lacking	
.	

Some	
studies	
have	
suggested	
that	
adult	
snorers	DISEASE
may	
have	
a	
higher	
prevalence	
of	
cardiovas-	
cular	
disease	
,	
including	
hypertension	DISEASE
,	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
and	
ischemic	
heart	
disease	
.	

However	
,	
a	
large	
observational	
study	
in	
which	
all	
subjects	
underwent	
PSG	
found	
no	
increased	
risk	
of	
cardiovascular	
morbidity	
or	
mortality	
with	
habitual	DISEASE
snoring	DISEASE
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
one	
study	
found	
that	
snoring	DISEASE
was	
associated	
with	
atherosclerosis	DISEASE
of	
the	
carotid	
artery	
,	
but	
this	
has	
not	
been	
confirmed	
by	
other	
studies	
.	

As	
snoring	DISEASE
tends	
to	
increase	
during	
pregnancy	
,	
the	
impact	
of	
snoring	DISEASE
on	
maternal	
health	
is	
of	
great	
interest	
.	

A

that

Catathrenia	DISEASE
Catathrenia	DISEASE
,	
also	
known	
as	
sleep	
related	
groaning	
,	
is	
included	
in	
the	
SRBD	
section	
because	
it	
appears	
to	
be	
associated	
with	
prolonged	
expiration	
,	
usually	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
some	
studies	
have	
documented	
catathrenia	DISEASE
during	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

Typically	
,	
a	
deep	
inspiration	
is	
followed	
by	
prolonged	
expiration	
and	
a	
monotonous	
vocalization	
resembling	
groaning	
.	

The	
pattern	
is	
sometimes	
called	
bradypnea	DISEASE
(	
low	
respiratory	
rate	
)	
.	

The	
affected	
individual	
is	
usually	
unaware	
of	
the	
problem	
,	
but	
clini-	
cal	
evaluation	
is	
sought	
due	
to	
complaints	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
or	
family	
members	
.	

The	
recurrent	
bradypneic	DISEASE
episodes	
may	
resemble	
central	
apnea	DISEASE
except	
that	
central	
apneas	
are	
not	
typically	
associated	
with	
vocalization	
.	

Catathrenia	DISEASE
is	
thought	
to	
be	
rare	
and	
more	
common	
in	
men	
.	

Several	
episodes	
may	
occur	
nightly	
and	
often	
in	
clusters	
.	

The	
long	
-	
term	
consequences	
of	
catathrenia	DISEASE
are	
unknown	
,	
but	
the	
disorder	
is	
primarily	
a	
social	
problem	
for	
the	
affected	
individual	
.	

The	
episodes	
of	
catathrenia	DISEASE
are	
not	
associ-	
ated	
with	
sleep	
talking	
or	
body	
movement	
.	

No	
association	
with	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
has	
been	
demonstrated	
.	

The	
onset	
of	
catathrenia	DISEASE
has	
recently	
been	
reported	
in	
patients	
taking	
sodium	CHEMICAL
oxybate	CHEMICAL
for	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
.	

The	
clinical	
significance	
of	
this	
finding	
is	
unclear

function	
,

This	
section	
includes	
a	
group	
of	
disorders	
in	
which	
the	
primary	
complaint	
is	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
not	
caused	
by	
disturbed	
nocturnal	
sleep	
or	
misaligned	
circadian	
rhythms	
.	

Other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
,	
but	
they	
must	
be	
adequately	
treated	
before	
a	
diagnosis	
in	
this	
category	
can	
be	
established	
.	

In	
this	
nosology	
,	
the	
term	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
is	
used	
to	
describe	
the	
symptom	
of	
exces-	
sive	
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
whereas	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
refers	
to	
specific	
disorders	
,	
such	
as	
idiopathic	DISEASE
hypersomnia	DISEASE
.	

Daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
defined	
as	
the	
inability	
to	
stay	
awake	
and	
alert	
during	
the	
major	
waking	
episodes	
of	
the	
day	
,	
resulting	
in	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
for	
sleep	
or	
unin-	
tended	
lapses	
into	
drowsiness	DISEASE
or	
sleep	
.	

Sleepiness	
may	
vary	
in	
severity	
and	
is	
more	
likely	
to	
occur	
in	
sedentary	
,	
boring	
,	
and	
monotonous	
situations	
that	
require	
little	
active	
participation	
.	

Some	
patients	
are	
aware	
of	
increasing	
sleepiness	DISEASE
before	
falling	
asleep	
,	
whereas	
others	
can	
fall	
asleep	
with	
little	
or	
no	
prodromal	
symptoms	
(	
“	
sleep	
attacks	
”	
)	
.	

This	
group	
of	
patients	
sometimes	
can	
present	
following	
motor	
vehicle	
accidents	
attrib-	
utable	
to	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

In	
some	
forms	
of	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
associated	
with	
large	
increases	
in	
total	
daily	
amount	
of	
sleep	
without	
any	
genuine	
feeling	
of	
resto-	
ration	
.	

In	
others	
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
can	
be	
alleviated	
temporarily	
by	
naps	
but	
reoccurs	
shortly	
thereafter	
.	

In	
young	
children	
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
express	
itself	
as	
excessively	
long	
night	
sleep	
or	
with	
the	
recurrence	
of	
previously	
discontinued	
daytime	
napping	
.	

Children	
may	
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
paradoxically	
present	
with	
inattentiveness	DISEASE
,	
emotional	
lability	
,	
hyperactive	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
,	
or	
decreased	
performance	
in	
school	
.	

In	
most	
cases	
,	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
a	
chronic	
symptom	
.	

It	
must	
occur	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
prior	
to	
diagnosis	
.	

The	
severity	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
can	
be	
quantified	
subjectively	
using	
severity	
scales	
such	
as	
the	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
and	
objectively	
using	
the	
Multiple	
Sleep	
Latency	
Test	
(	
MSLT	
)	
.	

These	
measures	
do	
not	
always	
correlate	
with	
each	
other	
and	
must	
be	
used	
with	
appropriate	
clinical	
judgment	
.	

When	
applied	
in	
clinical	
settings	
,	
the	
MSLT	
is	
sensitive	
to	
sleep	
deprivation	
and	
circadian	
effects	
.	

It	
has	
not	
been	
validated	
as	
a	
diagnostic	
test	
in	
people	
who	
are	
habitually	
awake	
throughout	
the	
night	
and	
sleep	
during	
the	
day	
.	

Normal	
and	
abnormal	
ranges	
of	
sleep	
latencies	
have	
not	
been	
estab-	
lished	
when	
this	
test	
is	
administered	
at	
times	
other	
than	
the	
hours	
between	
8:00	
a.m.	
and	
6:00	
p.m.	

Normative	
data	
are	
not	
available	
for	
children	
younger	
than	
six	
years	
.	

The	
MSLT	
measures	
the	
physiological	
tendency	
to	
fall	
asleep	
in	
quiet	
situations	
.	

In	
the	
context	
of	
diagnosing	
central	
disorders	
of	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
,	
the	
MSLT	
should	
be	
con-	
ducted	
according	
to	
standardized	
procedures	
,	
as	
defined	
in	
the	
American

In	
particular	
,	
patients	
should	
be	
encour-	
aged	
to	
sleep	
as	
much	
as	
possible	
during	
the	
week	
and	
,	
especially	
,	
during	
the	
night	
prior	
to	
the	
MSLT	
.	

Delaying	
wake	
-	
up	
time	
and	
subsequent	
MSLT	
start	
time	
may	
be	
appropriate	
in	
some	
patients	
with	
delayed	
sleep	DISEASE
phase	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
.	

It	
is	
strongly	
rec-	
ommended	
that	
adequate	
sleep	
be	
documented	
by	
sleep	
log	
and	
,	
whenever	
possible	
,	
actigraphy	
for	
a	
period	
of	
one	
to	
two	
weeks	
prior	
to	
the	
MSLT	
.	

MSLT	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
should	
be	
considered	
a	
continuum	
with	
values	
below	
five	
minutes	
generally	
considered	
as	
indicative	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
those	
over	
10	
minutes	
generally	
consid-	
ered	
indicative	
of	
normal	
alertness	
.	

In	
this	
section	
,	
a	
mean	
MSLT	
sleep	
latency	
of	
less	
than	
eight	
minutes	
is	
used	
to	
define	
sleepiness	
for	
diagnostic	
purposes	
.	

This	
value	
has	
been	
shown	
to	
be	
the	
best	
cutoff	
in	
the	
context	
of	
diagnosing	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
with	
approximately	
90	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
having	
a	
latency	
below	
this	
level	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
multiple	
sleep	
onset	
rapid	
eye	
movement	
periods	
(	
SOREMPs	DISEASE
)	
during	
the	
MSLT	
is	
a	
more	
specific	
finding	
in	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
than	
is	
a	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
less	
than	
or	
equal	
to	
eight	
minutes	
,	
although	
SOREMPs	DISEASE
can	
also	
be	
seen	
in	
the	
presence	
of	
insuffi-	
cient	
sleep	
,	
circadian	
rhythm	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
(	
including	
delayed

)	
,	
sleep	
related	
breathing	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
or	
,	
occasionally	
,	
normal	
subjects	
.	

The	
results	
of	
an	
MSLT	
should	
be	
carefully	
interpreted	
in	
the	
context	
of	
the	
patient	
’s	
history	
and	
the	
complaint	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

The	
maintenance	
of	
wakefulness	
test	
is	
a	
measure	
of	
the	
ability	
to	
remain	
awake	
during	
the	
daytime	
in	
a	
darkened	
,	
quiet	
environment	
and	
is	
usually	
administered	
to	
assess	
response	
to	
treatment	
.	

It	
should	
not	
be	
used	
for	
diagnostic	
purposes	
.	

A	
24	
-	
hour	
continuous	
sleep	
recording	
or	
an	
actigraphic	
recording	
of	
at	
least	
one	
week	
is	
useful	
in	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
some	
patients	
with	
idiopathic	DISEASE
hypersomnia	DISEASE
.	

In	
all	
cases	
in	
which	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
is	
to	
be	
made	
,	
a	
review	
of	
other	
sleep	
,	
medical	
,	
and	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
as	
well	
as	
substance	
and	
medication	
use	
,	
should	
be	
performed	
.	

In	
this	
edition	
of	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
the	
preferred	
names	
of	
certain	
central	
disorders	
of	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
have	
been	
changed	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
nar-	
colepsy	
has	
been	
divided	
into	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
and	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
rather	
than	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
with	
and	
without	
cataplexy	DISEASE
.	

This	
change	
is	
predicated	
on	
the	
concept	
that	
absence	
of	
hypocretin	
(	
orexin	
)	
is	
a	
fundamental	
marker	
of	
the	
most	
precisely	
defined	
category	
of	
the	
disorder	
.	

Because	
some	
patients	
without	
cataplexy	DISEASE
will	
also	
have	
low	
cerebrospinal	
fluid	
(	
CSF	
)	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
,	
the	
use	
of	
the	
term	
“	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
”	
or	
“	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
-	
cataplexy	DISEASE
”	
is	
inappropriate	
.	

The	
change	
is	
not	
intended	
to	
imply	
that	
the	
presence	
or	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
unimportant	
clinically	
nor	
that	
mea-	
suring	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
is	
obligatory	
.	

The	
motivation	
behind	
the	
decision	
to	
eliminate	
the	
subcategories	
of	
idiopathic	DISEASE
hypersomnia	DISEASE
is	
discussed	
in	
the	
appropriate	
section	
.	

The	
decision	
to	
use	
Kleine	
-	
Levin	
syndrome	
as	
the	
preferred	
name	
in	
place	
of	
recurrent	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
is	
based	
on	
data	
suggesting	
that	
the	
condition	
is	
fairly	
homo-	
geneous	
,	
as	
well	
as	
the	
lack	
of	
definite	
evidence	
for	
other	
major	
subcategories	
of	
the	
disorder	
.

A.	

The	
patient	
has	
daily	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
to	
sleep	
or	
daytime	
lapses	
into	
sleep	
occurring	
for	
at

three	
months.1

of	
one

of	
the	
following	
:

Cataplexy	DISEASE

under	
Essential	
Features	
)

≤	CHEMICAL
8	
minutes	
and	
two	
or	
more	
sleep

SOREMP	DISEASE
(	
within	
15	
minutes	
of

Notes	
.	

In	
young	
children	
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
may	
sometimes	
present	
as	
excessively	
long	
night	
sleep	
or	
as	
resumption	
of	
previously	
discontinued	
daytime	
napping	
.	
.	

If	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
I	
is	
strongly	
suspected	
clinically	
but	
the	
MSLT	
criteria	
of	
B1	
are	
not	
met	
,	
a	
possible	
strategy	
is	
to	
repeat	
the	
MSLT	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
is	
a	
disorder	
primarily	
characterized	
by	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepi-	
ness	
and	
signs	
of	
REM	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
dissociation	DISEASE
,	
the	
most	
specific	
of	
which	
is	
cataplexy	DISEASE
.	

It	
has	
now	
been	
firmly	
established	
that	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
is	
caused	
by	
a	
deficiency	
of	
hypothalamic	
hypocretin	
(	
orexin	
)	
signaling	
.	

Patients	
with	
low	
or	
undetectable	
concen-	
trations	
of	
hypocretin-1	
in	
the	
CSF	
compose	
a	
specific	
disease	
population	
with	
a	
single	
etiology	
and	
relatively	
homogenous	
clinical	
and	
polysomnographic	
features	
.	

Patients	
with	
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
low	
or	
absent	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	

levels	
are	
classified	
as	
having	
nar-	
colepsy	
type	
1	
,	
even	
if	
they	
do	
not	
manifest	
cataplexy	DISEASE
.	

Excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
the	
cardinal	
symptom	
,	
and	
often	
the	
most	
disabling	
.	

Patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
experience	
repeated	
daily	
episodes	
of	
an	
irrepressible	
need	
to	
sleep	
or	
lapses	
into	
sleep	
.	

Most	
patients	
awaken	
refreshed	
after	
a	
sleep	
episode	
but	
begin	
to	
feel	
sleepy	
again	
after	
variable	
times	
.	

Sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
most	
likely	
to	
occur	
in	
monotonous	
situations	
that	
require	
no	
active	
participation	
;	
for	
example	
,	
watching	
television	
or	
riding	
in	
a	
car	
.	

Physical	
activity	
may	
temporarily	
suppress	
the	
urge	
to	
sleep	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
sleepiness	DISEASE
manifests	
as	
sudden	DISEASE
irresistible	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
“	
attacks	
”	
that	
may	
occur	
in	
unusual	
situations	
such	
as	
eating	
or	
walking	
.	

Often	
,	
such	
sleep	
attacks	
occur	
on	
a	
background	
of	
overall	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Even	
when	
seemingly	
awake	
,	
many	
nar-	
colepsy	
patients	
have	
lapses	
in	
vigilance	
,	
sometimes	
in	
combination	
with	
automatic	
behavior	
,	
such	
as	
writing	
gibberish	
or	
interrupting	
a	
conversation	
with	
a	
completely	
different	
topic	
.	

Sleepiness	
generally	
has	
a	
serious	
impact	
on	
the	
ability	
of	
the	
patient	
to	
function	
in	
educational	
,	
social	
,	
and	
occupational	
situations	
.	

Because	
patients	
are	
rarely	
examined	
during	
an	
attack	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
its	
presence	
needs	
to	
be	
established	
based	
on	
the	
clinical	
interview	
alone	
.	

Cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
defined	
as	
more	
than	
one	
episode	
of	
generally	
brief	
(	
<	
2	
minutes	
)	
,	
usually	
bilaterally	
symmetrical	
sudden	
loss	
of	
muscle	
tone	
with	
retained	
consciousness	
.	

The	
episodes	
are	
precipitated	
by	
strong	
emotions	
,	
usually	
positive	
,	
with	
almost	
all	
patients	
reporting	
some	
episodes	
precipitated	
by	
emotions	
associated	
with	
laughter	
.	

The	
finding	
of	
transient	
reversible	
loss	
of	
deep	
tendon	
reflexes	
during	
an	
attack	
,	
if	
observed	
,	
is	
a	
strong	
diagnostic	
finding	
.	

In	
children	
(	
and	
rarely	
adults	
)	
,	
cataplexy	DISEASE
may	
present	
close	
to	
disease	
onset	
as	
facial	
(	
or	
generalized	
)	
hypotonia	DISEASE
with	
droopy	
eyelids	
,	
mouth	
opening	
,	
and	
protruded	
tongue	
,	
or	
gait	DISEASE
unsteadiness	DISEASE
,	
which	
clearly	
are	
not	
related	
to	
emotion	
.	

Facial	
and	
masticatory	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
may	
occur	
.	

In	
children	
,	
anticipation	
of	
a	
reward	
is	
a	
common	
precipitant	
.	

It	
is	
important	
to	
use	
child	
-	
appropriate	
contexts	
and	
language	
when	
trying	
to	
elicit	
a	
history	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
in	
children	
.	

The	
cataplexy	DISEASE
phenotype	
differs	
widely	
between	
patients	
,	
ranging	
from	
sporadic	
partial	
attacks	DISEASE
triggered	
by	
laughter	
,	
to	
frequent	
complete	
attacks	
of	
collapse	
brought	
about	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
emotions	
.	

In	
the	
vast	
majority	
of	
attacks	DISEASE
,	
cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
bilateral	
,	
although	
patients	
sometimes	
report	
one	
side	
of	
the	
body	
to	
be	
more	
affected	
than	
the	
other	
.	

Partial	
attacks	DISEASE
can	
be	
very	
subtle	
and	
sometimes	
only	
recognized	
by	
experi-	
enced	
observers	
such	
as	
the	
patient	
’s	
partner	
.	

Neck	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
,	
producing	
head	
drop	
,	
is	
a	
common	
complaint	
,	
whereas	
facial	
weakness	DISEASE
may	
lead	
to	
sagging	
of	
the	
jaw	
and	
dysarthria	DISEASE
.	

Respiratory	
muscles	
are	
not	
involved	
although	
patients	
sometimes	
describe	
shortness	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
breath	DISEASE
when	
symptomatic	
.	

Attacks	
start	
abruptly	
and	
usually	
build	
up	
over	
several	
seconds	
,	
especially	
in	
attacks	
producing	
complete	
peripheral	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
and	
collapse	
.

Although	
many	
emotions	
can	
potentially	
lead	
to	
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
those	
associated	
with	
mirth	
are	
usually	
the	
most	
potent	
.	

Laughing	
out	
loud	
,	
telling	
a	
joke	
,	
and	
making	
a	
witty	
remark	
are	
typical	
examples	
.	

The	
frequency	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
variable	
,	
ranging	
from	
less	
than	
one	
attack	
per	
month	
to	
more	
than	
20	
attacks	
per	
day	
.	

Cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
generally	
short	
-	
lived	
,	
lasting	
a	
matter	
of	
seconds	
,	
with	
the	
vast	
majority	
of	
attacks	DISEASE
lasting	
less	
than	
two	
minutes	
.	

However	
,	
if	
a	
particular	
trigger	
continues	
,	
consecutive	
attacks	DISEASE
may	
merge	
together	
to	
form	
what	
seems	
to	
be	
one	
long	
episode	
.	

Sudden	
withdrawal	
of	
anticataplectic	
medication	
,	
especially	
anti-	
depressants	
,	
can	
result	
in	
“	
status	DISEASE
cataplecticus	DISEASE
”	
in	
which	
long	
-	
lasting	
attacks	
happen	
virtually	
continuously	
.	

Associated	
Features	
In	
addition	
to	
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
often	
report	
several	
other	
symptoms	
,	
none	
of	
which	
are	
specific	
for	
the	
disorder	
.	

Many	
patients	
report	
disruption	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
which	
can	
sometimes	
be	
of	
major	
concern	
.	

Although	
sleep	
onset	
is	
rarely	
a	
problem	
,	
an	
inability	
to	
maintain	
continuous	
sleep	
is	
very	
common	
.	

33	
%	
to	
80	
%	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
patients	
have	
hypnagogic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
and/or	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

Hypnagogic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
are	
defined	
as	
vivid	
dreamlike	
expe-	
riences	
occurring	
at	
the	
transition	
from	
wake	
to	
sleep	
.	

Typically	
,	
hypnagogic	
halluci-	
nations	
have	
a	
multimodal	
or	
“	
holistic	
”	
character	
,	
often	
combining	
visual	
,	
auditory	
,	
and	
tactile

Sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
describes	
the	
disturbing	
temporary	
inability	
to	
move	
voluntary	
muscles	
at	
sleep	
-	
wake	
transitions	
.	

Despite	
being	
awake	
and	
conscious	
of	
the	
sleeping	
environment	
,	
it	
is	
impossible	
for	
subjects	
to	
move	
their	
limbs	
or	
even	
open	
their	
eyes	
.	

The	
experience	
may	
last	
for	
several	
minutes	
and	
can	
be	
very	
distressing	
.	

Other	
symptoms	
may	
include	
ptosis	DISEASE
,	
blurred	DISEASE
vision	DISEASE
,	
and	
diplopia	DISEASE
,	
presumably	
as	
a	
result	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Epidemiological	
studies	
have	
shown	
that	
obesity	DISEASE
is	
a	
common	
symptom	
of	
narco-	
lepsy	
.	

Around	
disease	
onset	
,	
an	
unexplained	
increase	
in	
body	
weight	
is	
often	
observed	
.	

Obesity	DISEASE
(	
defined	
as	
a	
body	
mass	
index	
≥	
30	
kg	
/	
m2	
)	
occurs	
more	
than	
twice	
as	
often	
in	
narcoleptic	DISEASE
populations	
as	
in	
control	
groups	
.	

An	
increased	
frequency	
of	
several	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
has	
been	
described	
in	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
including	
sleep

There	
is	
an	
increased	
prevalence	
of	
depressive	DISEASE
symptoms	DISEASE
,	
although	
there	
are	
con-	
flicting	
reports	
on	
how	
often	
these	
symptoms	
qualify	
as	
a	
clinical	
depression	DISEASE

Recent

to	
a

level	
of

in	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
with	
panic	DISEASE

in	
about	
20	
%

More	
than	
half	
of	
patients	
report	
severe	
fatigue	DISEASE
,	
which	
can	
be	
distinct	
from	
sleepiness	DISEASE

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Narcolepsy	
type	
1	
due	
to	
a	
medical	
condition	
:	

This	
condition	
is	
primarily	
associated	
with	
central	
nervous	
system	
(	
CNS	
)	
disorders	
,	
including	
autoimmune	
or	
paraneoplastic	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
associated	
with	
anti

Ma2	
or	
antiaquaporin4	
antibodies	
,	
and	
tumors	DISEASE
or	
other	
lesions	
of	
the	
hypothalamus	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
undetectable	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
association	
with	
sleepiness	DISEASE
after	
severe	
head	DISEASE
trauma	DISEASE
.	

The	
condition	
must	
fulfill	
criteria	
for	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
and	
be	
attributable	
to	
another	
medical	
disorder	
.	

Narcolepsy	DISEASE

levels	
:	
Narcolepsy	DISEASE
type

should	
be	
diagnosed

even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
if	
diagnostic	
criteria	
A	
and	
B2	
are	
fulfilled

Demographics	
Narcolepsy	DISEASE

cataplexy	DISEASE
occurs	
in	
0.02	
%	
to	
0.18	
%	
of	
the	
United	
States	
and	
western	
European	
populations	
.	

A	
lower	
prevalence	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
Israel	
,	
whereas	
narco-	
lepsy	
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
may	
be	
slightly	
more	
common	
in	
Japan	
(	
0.16	
%	
to	
0.18	
%	
)	
.	

Both	
sexes	
are	
affected

with	
a	
slight	
preponderance	
of	
males	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Several	
unproven	
precipitating	
factors	
have	
been	
suggested	
in	
case	
reports	
,	
including	
head	
trauma	DISEASE
,	
sustained	
sleep	
deprivation	
,	
unspecified	
viral	DISEASE
illness	DISEASE
,	
and	
sudden	
changes	
in	
sleep

wake	
patterns	
.	

Several	
studies	
have	
pointed	
to	
seasonal	
patterns	
in	
the	
onset	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
which	
may	
point	
to	
a	
specific	
environmental	
trigger	
.	

Recent	
studies	
have	
shown	
an	
increase	
in	
antibodies	
against	
beta	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
hemolytic	DISEASE
streptococcus	DISEASE
,	
which	
were	
strongest	
around	
onset	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
and	
decreased	
with	
disease	
duration	
,	
suggesting	
that	
streptococcal	DISEASE
infections	DISEASE
may	
constitute	
an	
environmental	
trigger	
.	

There	
have	
been	
reports	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
occurring	
after	
vaccination	
against	
H1N1	DISEASE
associated	
influ-	
enza

but	
a	
definite	
causal	
association	
has	
not	
yet	
been	
established

been	
described	
in	
14	
%	
to	
26	
%	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
patients	
,	
but	
the	
significance	
is	
uncertain	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
At	
the	
genetic	
level	
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
closely	
associated	
with	
the	
human	
leukocyte	
antigen	
(	
HLA	
)	
subtypes	
DR2	
/	
DRB1	
*	
1501	
and	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
.	

These	
two	
subtypes	
are	
always	
found	
together	
in	
whites	
and	
Asians	
,	
but	
in	
blacks	
,	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
is	
more	
specifically	
associated	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
.	

Almost	
all	
patients	
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
are	
positive	
for	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
,	
compared	
with	
12	
%	
to	
38	
%	
of	
the	
general	
population	
who	
have	
this	
HLA	
subtype	
.	

Other	
subtypes	
also	
have	
less	
striking	
associations	
.	

For	
example	
,	
DQB1	
*	
0301	
is	
associated	
with	
increased	
susceptibility	
to	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
Central

Central

whereas	
subtypes	
such	
as	
DQB1

*	
0601	
,	
are	
protective	
in	
the

0602	
.	

Genomewide	
studies	
have	
found	
associations	
between	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
and	
polymorphisms	
in	
T	
cell	
receptor	
alpha	
,	
tumor	DISEASE
necrosis	DISEASE
factor	
(	
TNF)-alpha	
2	
,	
and	
TNF	
receptor	
2	
as	
well	
as	
the	
purinergic	
receptor	
P2Y11	
genes	
.	

There	
is	
a	
low	
prevalence	
of	
familial	
cases	
;	
the	
risk	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
in	
first	
-	
de-	
gree	
relatives	
of	
affected	
individuals	
is	
approximately	
1	
%	
to	
2	
%	
.	

When	
compared	
to	
the	
population	
prevalence	
,	
this	
indicates	
a	
tenfold	
to	
fortyfold	
increase	
in	
risk	
.	

This	
increased	
risk	
can	
not	
be	
explained	
solely	
by	
HLA	
gene	
effects	
,	
suggesting	
the	
exis-	
tence	
of	
other	
genetic	
factors	
.	

Multiplex	
families	
with	
more	
than	
two	
affected	
members	
are	
uncommon	
.	

In	
most	
cases	
,	
normal	
CSF	
hypocretin	
levels	
have	
been	
found	
in	
these	
families	
,	
and	
the	
association	
with	
HLA	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
is	
much	
weaker	
compared	
to	
spo-	
radic	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
.	

So	
far	
,	
only	
a	
single	
case	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
has	
been	
described	
in	
association	
with	
a	
preprohypocretin	
mutation	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
usually	
occurs	
after	
five	
years	
of	
age	
and	
most	
typically	
between	
ages	
10	
and	
25	
years	
.	

However	
,	
a	
bimodal	
distribution	
in	
the	
age	
at	
onset	
has	
been	
described	
in	
some	
populations	
with	
a	
first	
peak	
occurring	
at	
adolescence	
(	
age	
15	
years	
)	
and	
a	
second	
at	
the	
age	
of	
35	
years	
.	

Recent	
studies	
highlight	
the	
fact	
that	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
and	
especially	
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
in	
young	
children	
may	
present	
somewhat	
differently	
,	
resulting	
in	
delayed	
diagnosis	
and	
erroneously	
high	
estimates	
of	
age	
of	
onset	
.	

Sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
usually	
the	
first	
symptom	
to	
manifest	
.	

Cataplexy	DISEASE
most	
often	
occurs	
within	
one	
year	
of	
onset	
but	
in	
rare	
cases	
,	
may	
precede	
the	
onset	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
or	
commence	
up	
to	
40	
years	
later	
.	

Hypnagogic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
,	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
,	
and	
disturbed	
noctur-	
nal	
sleep	
often	
manifest	
later	
in	
the	
course	
of	
the	
disease	
.	

When	
left	
untreated	
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
is	
often	
socially	
disabling	
and	
isolating	
.	

Patients	
have	
a	
tendency	
to	
fail	
in	
school	
and	
are	
often	
dismissed	
from	
their	
jobs	
.	

Driving	
may	
be	
avoided	
for	
fear	
of	
a	
motor	
vehicle	
accident	
.	

The	
inability	DISEASE
to	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
at	
night	
may	
further	
contribute	
to	
a	
loss	
of	
control	
these	
patients	
have	
over	
their	
schedule	
.	

Depression	DISEASE
and	
weight	DISEASE
gain	DISEASE
also	
are	
common	
.	

In	
most	
cases	
,	
symptoms	
gradually	
develop	
over	
several	
years	
.	

When	
the	
clinical	
picture	
has	
fully	
developed	
,	
there	
are	
usually	
only	
minor	
fluctuations	
in	
severity	
.	

Cataplexy	DISEASE
may	
lessen	
with	
age	
,	
or	
occasionally	
increase	
in	
frequency	
and	
severity	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
In	
recent	
years	
,	
increasing	
attention	
has	
been	
given	
to	
the	
clinical	
presentation	
of	
nar-	
colepsy	
in	
childhood	
.	

Narcolepsy	DISEASE
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
infrequent	
prior	
to	
the	
age	
of	
four	
years	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
clinical	
presentation	
in	
children	
may	
be	
different	
from	
that	
of	
adults	
.	

In	
young	
children	
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
assess	
,	
and	
may	
express	
itself	
as	
excessively	
long	
night	
sleep	
,	
or	
the	
recurrence	
of	
previously	
discontinued	
daytime	
napping	
.	

Moreover	
,	
children	
may	
paradoxically	
present	
with	
hyperactive	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
,	
behavioral	
problems	
or	
decreased	
performance	
in	
school	
.	

Inattentiveness	DISEASE
,	
lack	
of	
energy	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
bizarre	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
,	
or	
a	
combination	
thereof	
can	
lead	
to	
a	
psy-	
chiatric	
misdiagnosis	
of	
schizophrenia	DISEASE
or	
depression	DISEASE
.	

In	
this	
population	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
ancillary	
symptoms	
such	
as	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
or	
hypnagogic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
may	
also	
be	
difficult	
to	
confirm	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
child	
’s	
verbal	
ability	
.	

Precocious	
puberty	
and	
obesity	DISEASE
may	
also	
develop	
around	
the	
time	
of	
symptom	
onset	
.	

REM	
sleep	
behavior	
dis-	
order	
or	
REM	
sleep	
without	
atonia	DISEASE
may	
also	
be	
manifest	
at	
the	
time	
of	
symptom	
onset	
.	

Cataplexy	DISEASE
may	
be	
very	
severe	
around	
disease	
onset	
and	
appear	
phenotypically	
differ-	
ent	
from	
typical	
episodes	
seen	
in	
adulthood	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
typical	
attacks	DISEASE
triggered	
by	
positive	
emotions	
,	
children	
can	
also	
present	
with	
weakness	DISEASE
involving	
the	
face	
,	
eyelids	
,	
and	
mouth	
not	
clearly	
associated	
with	
emotion	
.	

Together	
with	
tongue	
protrusion	
,	
this	
characteristic	
pattern	
has	
been	
termed	
a	
cataplectic	DISEASE
facies	DISEASE
.	

Children	
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
may	
also	
display	
positive	
motor	
phenomena	
,	
ranging	
from	
perioral	DISEASE
dyskinetic	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
dys-	DISEASE
tonic	
movements	DISEASE
to	
frank	
stereotypies	
.	

In	
children	
,	
anticipation	
of	
reward	
may	
also	
be	
a	
precipitant	
.	

The	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
in	
children	
may	
be	
complicated	
because	
of	
diffi-	
culties	
performing	
the	
MSLT	
,	
and	
lack	
of	
normative	
values	
in	
children	
younger	
than	
six	
years	
.	

If	
the	
MSLT	
shows	
equivocal	
results	
,	
repeating	
it	
after	
a	
time	
interval	
may	
be	
helpful	
.	

Given	
these	
difficulties	
,	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	
measurements	
are	
of	
particular	
value	
,	
as	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
are	
low	
or	
undetectable	
very	
shortly	
after	
disease	
onset	
in	
children	
as	
well	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
It	
is	
now	
firmly	
established	
that	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
is	
caused	
by	
deficiencies	
in	
hypo-	DISEASE
cretin	DISEASE
signaling	
,	
most	
likely	
due	
to	
a	
selective	
loss	
of	
hypothalamic	
hypocretin	
pro-	
ducing	
neurons	
.	

Several	
animal	
models	
lacking

,	
indicating	
a	
causal	
relationship	
.	

The	
vast	
majority	
of	
patients	
(	
90	
%	
to	
95	
%	
)	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
and	
cataplexy	DISEASE
have	
undetectable	
or	
low	
(	
<	
110	
pg	
/	
mL	
)	
levels	
of	
hypocretin-1	
in	
the	
CSF	
.	

Patients	
without	
cataplexy	DISEASE
can	
be	
hypocretin	
deficient	
as	
well	
,	
although	
at	
a	
much	
lower	
frequency	
,	
and	
are	
thus	
also	
classified	
as	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
type	
1	
.	

The	
strong	
HLA	
association	
in	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
has	
led	
to	
the	
hypothesis	
that	
auto-	
immunity	
is	
a	
likely	
etiological	
mechanism	
,	
potentially	
explaining	
the	
selectivity	
of	
neuronal	DISEASE
destruction	DISEASE
in	
the	
hypothalamus	
.	

However	
,	
definitive	
proof	
for	
autoimmunity	DISEASE
has	
not	
been	
obtained	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
is	
essentially	
defined	
as	
a	
hypocretin	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
which	
is	
reflected	
in	
the	
need	
for	
objective	
measurements	
in	
the	
clinical	
criteria	
.	

This	
require-	
ment	
is	
further	
driven	
by	
the	
fact	
that	
many	
patients	
require	
lifelong	
treatment	
with	
potentially	
addictive	
medications	
,	
underscoring	
the	
importance	
of	
objective	
confirma-	
tion	
of	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

It	
is	
strongly	
recommended	
that	
the	
MSLT	
be	
preceded	
by	
at	
least	
one	
week	
of	
acti-	
graphic	
recording	
with	
a	
sleep	
log	
to	
establish	
whether	
the	
results	
could	
be	
biased	
by	
insufficient	
sleep	
,	
shift	
work	
,	
or	
another	
circadian	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

In	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
,	
the	
MSLT	
demonstrates	
a	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
of	
less	
than	
eight	
minutes	
and	
typically	
less	
than	
five	
minutes	
.	

Meta	
-	
analysis	
shows	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
in	
narcoleptic	DISEASE
patients	
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
of	
3.1	
±	
2.9	
minutes	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
two	
or	
more	
SOREMPs	CHEMICAL
must	
be	
present	
.	

Recent	
data	
suggest	
that	
a	
SOREMP	DISEASE
within	
15	
minutes	
of	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
is	
a	
highly	
specific	
finding	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
another	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
but	
with	
low	
sensitivity	
.	

Therefore	
,	
the	
criteria	
for	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
allow	
the	
“	
replacement	
”	
of	
one	
SOREMP	DISEASE
in	
the	
MSLT	
with	
a	
SOREMP	DISEASE
on	
the	
preceding	
poly-	
somnogram	
.	

For	
the	
correct	
interpretation	
of	
MSLT	
findings	
,	
the	
recordings	
should	
be	
performed	
with	
the	
following	
conditions	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
patient	
must	
be	
free	
of	
drugs	
that	
influence	
sleep	
for	
at	
least	
14	
days	
(	
or	
at	
least	
five	
times	
the	
half	
-	
life	
of	
the	
drug	
and	
longer	
-	
acting	
metabolite	
)	
,	
confirmed	
by	
a	
urine	
drug	
screen	
;	
(	
2	
)	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
sched-	
ule	
must	
have	
been	
standardized	
and	
,	
if	
necessary	
,	
extended	
to	
a	
minimum	
of	
seven	
hours	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
(	
longer	
for	
children	
)	
for	
at	
least	
seven	
days	
before	
polysom-	

nography	
(	
preferably	
documented	
by	
sleep	
log	
and	
,	
whenever	
possible	
,	
actigraphy	
)	
;	
and	
(	
3	
)	
nocturnal	
polysomnography	
should	
be	
performed	
on	
the	
night	
immediately	
preceding	
the	
MSLT	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
that	
could	
mimic	
the	
diagnostic	
features	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
.	

Sleep	
time	
during	
polysomnography	
should	
be	
curtailed	
as	
little	
as	
possible	
with	
the	
goal	
of	
at	
least	
seven	
hours	
asleep	
.	

The	
overnight	
poly-	
somnogram	
may	
demonstrate	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
amount	
of	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
,	
and	
there	
may	
be	
a	
disruption	
of	
the	
normal	
sleep	
pattern	
,	
with	
frequent	
awakenings	
.	

REM	
sleep	
without	
atonia	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
.	

Measuring	
CSF	
levels	
of	
hypocretin-1	
is	
a	
highly	
specific	
and	
sensitive	
test	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
.	

Hypocretin-1	
can	
be	
measured	
in	
crude	
CSF	
,	
using	
a	
commercially	
available	
radioimmunoassay	
.	

When	
using	
the	
Stanford	
reference	
sample	
,	
values	
less	
than	
110	
pg	
/	
mL	
are	
highly	
specific	
.	

Alternatively	
,	
a	
laboratory	
may	
elect	
to	
obtain	
control	
data	
themselves	
,	
in	
which	
case	
a	
level	
of	
less	
than	
33	
%	
of	
mean	
control	
values	
is	
considered	
abnormal	
.	

Issues	
concerning	
the	
standardization	
of	
CSF	
hypocre-	
tin	
measurements	
remain	
,	
but	
extensive	
protocols	
are	
available	
.	

Low	
CSF	
hypocre-	
tin	
values	
are	
occasionally	
observed	
in	
seriously	
ill	DISEASE
patients	
with	
other	
disorders	
and	
should	
be	
interpreted	
within	
the	
clinical	
context	
.	

HLA	
typing	
of	
narcoleptic	DISEASE
patients	
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
almost	
always	
shows	
the	
presence	
of	
HLA	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
(	
and	
DR2	
or	
DRB1	
*	
1501	
in	
whites	
and	
Asians	
)	
,	
but	
this	
is	
not	
diagnostic	
for	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
.	

Approximately	
25	
%	
of	
the	
normal	
Caucasian	
population	
,	
12	
%	
of	
the	
Japanese	
population	
,	
and	
38	
%	
of	
the	
black	
population	
are	
positive	
for	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
.	

HLA	
typing	
could	
be	
considered	
when	
a	
spinal	
tap	
is	
contemplated	
to	
assess	
hypocretin-1	
values	
:	
if	
the	
patient	
is	
HLA	
-	
negative	
,	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
are	
most	
likely	
normal	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
In	
the	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
can	
be	
diagnosed	
based	
on	
the	
pres-	
ence	
of	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
and	
low	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
.	

When	
cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
absent	
and	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
are	
normal	
or	
unknown	
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
should	
be	
diagnosed	
.	

Cataplexy	DISEASE
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
cataplexy	DISEASE
-	
like	
episodes	
that	
are	
occasionally	
observed	
in	
normal	
individuals	
.	

For	
example	
,	
feelings	
of	
muscle	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
are	
some-	
times	
reported	
when	
healthy	
subjects	
laugh	
out	
loud	
.	

In	
genuine	
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
episodes	
most	
often	
occur	
with	
a	
significant	
frequency	
,	
and	
are	
associated	
with	
loss	
of	
muscle	
tone	
.	

Cataplexy	DISEASE
should	
be	
differentiated	
from	
hypotension	DISEASE
,	
transient	
ischemic	DISEASE
attacks	DISEASE
,	
drop	
attacks	
,	
akinetic	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
,	
neuromuscular	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
vestibular	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
psycho-	CHEMICAL
logical	
or	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
and	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

Clear	
improvement	
with	
antide-	
pressant	
medications	
may	
favor	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
in	
difficult	
cases	
.	

Sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
be	
secondary	
to	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
,	
insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
shift	
work	
,	
the	
effects	
of	
substances	
or	
medications	
,	
or	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Many	
of	
these	
conditions	
can	
result	
in	
early	
onset	
REM	
sleep	
as	
well	
.	

When	
cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
present	
,	
these	
disorders	
do	
not	
preclude	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
.	

When	
there	
is	
a	
questionable	
history	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
in	
such	
cases	
,	
either	
comorbid	
conditions	
should	
be	
adequately	
treated	
before	
performing	
an	
MSLT	
or	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	
should	
be	
measured	
.	

Central

Central	
Disorders	
of	
Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
Idiopathic	DISEASE
hypersomnia	DISEASE
is	
differentiated	
from	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type

by	
the	
absence	
of	
cat-	
aplexy	
and	
the	
lack	
of	
two

In

with	
patients

narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
patients	
with

generally	
have

inates

.	

Chronic

and

may	
mimic	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
but	
do	
not	
show	
the	
typical

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Ten	
percent	
of	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
have	
normal	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
in	
the	
CSF	
,	
which	
suggests	
that	
CSF	
levels	
either	
do	
not	
perfectly	
reflect	
brain	
hypocretin	
neurotransmission	
or	
that	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
can	
be	
caused	
by	
factors	
other	
than	
hypocretin	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
.	

The	
cause	
of	
the	
hypocretin	
cell	
destruction	
remains	
unknown	
,	
although	
an	
autoimmune	
-	
mediated	
mechanism	
is	
suspected	
.	

Levels	
of	
hypocretin-1	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
the	
blood	
of	
some	
subjects	
.	

The	
development	
of	
serum	
tests	
to	
determine	
hypocretin	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
would	
provide	
a	
less	
invasive	
diagnos-	
tic	
approach

sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
abnormal	
man-	
ifestations	
of	
REM	
sleep	
on

atypical	DISEASE
sensations	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
weakness	DISEASE
triggered	
by	
unusual

Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Narcolepsy	
type	
2	
due	
to	
a	
medical	
condition	
:	

This	
condition	
fulfills	
criteria	
for	
nar-	
colepsy	
type	
2	
and	
is	
attributable	
to	
another	
medical	
disorder	
.	

Neurologic	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
associated	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
include	
tumors	DISEASE
or	
sarcoidosis	DISEASE
of	
the	
hypothalamus	
,	
autoimmune	DISEASE
or	
paraneoplastic	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
associated	
with

,	
and	
head

.	

In	
disorders	
associated	
with	
both	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
and	
narco-	
lepsy	
type	
2	
,	
such	
as	
myotonic	DISEASE
dystrophy	DISEASE
or	
Prader	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
Willi	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
should	
only	
be	
made	
if	
abnormal	
MSLT	
findings	
persist	
after	
the	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
is	
adequately	
treated	
.	

In	
all	
cases	
,	
especially	
with	
complex	
problems	
such	
as	
head	
trauma	DISEASE
,	
clinical	
judgment	
should	
be	
used	
to	
determine	
if	
the	
development	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
was	
a	
mere	
coincidence	
or	
was	
triggered	
by	
the	
event	
or	
disorder	
.	

Demographics	
The	
exact	
prevalence	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
is	
uncertain	
.	

Cases	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
without	
cat-	
aplexy	
represent	
15	
%	
to	
25	
%	
of	
the	
clinic	
narcoleptic	DISEASE
population	
.	

A	
population	
-	
based	
study	
suggested	
a	
higher	
percentage	
(	
36	
%	
)	
,	
corresponding	
to	
a	
point	
prevalence	
of	
20.5/100,000	
.	

Population	
-	
based	
studies	
have	
shown	
that	
approximately	
4	
%	
to	
9.5	
%	
of	
adults	
may	
have	
multiple	
SOREMPs	CHEMICAL
during	
random	
MSLTs	DISEASE
,	
but	
shift	
workers	
and	
subjects	
with	
sleep	
deprivation	
or	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
were	
included	
in	
the	
studies	
.	

Although	
both	
sexes	
can	
be	
affected	
,	
the	
prevalence	
may	
be	
slightly	
higher	
in	
men	
.	

The	
age	
of	
onset	
mirrors	
that	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
.	
Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
As	
discussed	
below	
,	
about	
24	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
but	
no	
cataplexy	DISEASE
will	
have	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
and	
almost	
all	
of	
these	
will	
be	
positive	
for	
the	
HLA	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
antigen	
.	

These	
patients	
probably	
share	
a	
common	
pathogenesis	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
and	
should	
be	
classified	
as	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
.	

Underlying	
genetic	
and	
envi-	
ronmental	
factors	
associated	
with	
other	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
are	
unknown	
.	

Environmental	
precipitating	
factors	
are	
suspected	
from	
case	
reports	
but	
have	
never	
been	
proven	
to	
trigger	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
without	
cataplexy	DISEASE
.	

Among	
the	
most	
commonly	
reported	
triggers	
are	
head	
trauma	DISEASE
and	
unspecified	
viral	
illnesses	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

The	
detailed	
genetic	
pattern	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
is	
unknown	
.	

Relatives	
of	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
may	
be	
more	
likely	
to	
experience	
partial	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
symptoms	
compatible	
with	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
typically	
occurs	
during	
adolescence	
.	

In	
about	
10	
%	
of	
patients	
,	
cataplexy	DISEASE
will	
develop	
later	
in	
the	
course	
of	
the	
disease	
,	
necessitating	
a	
change	
in	
diagnosis	
to	
narco-	
lepsy	
type	
1	
.	

Most	
of	
these	
patients	
will	
,	
if	
tested	
,	
have	
absent	
or	
intermediate	
levels	
of	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
.	

In	
a	
cohort	
of	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
without	
cataplexy	DISEASE
in	
whom	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
status	
was	
known	
,	
33	
%	
of	
those	
with	
low	
levels	
later	
developed	
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
compared	
with	
18	
%	
with	
intermediate	
levels	
and	
only	
1	
%	
with	
normal	
levels	
.	

When	
left	
untreated	
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
is	
socially	
disabling	
and	
isolating	
.	

Patients	
have	
a	
ten-	
dency	
to	
fail	
in	
school	
and	
are	
often	
dismissed	
from	
their	
jobs	
.	

Driving	
may	
be	
avoided	
for	
fear	
of	
a	
motor	
vehicle	
accident	
.	

The	
inability	DISEASE
to	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
at	
night	
may	
further	
contrib-	
ute	
to	
a	
loss	
of	
control	
these	
patients	
have	
over	
their	
schedule	
.	

Depression	DISEASE
and	
weight	DISEASE
gain	DISEASE
also	
are	
common	
.

typically	DISEASE
present	
with	
a	
reappearance	
of	
regular	
daytime	
napping	
after

In	
all	
pediatric	
cases	
,	
one	
should	
consider	
the	
possibility	
of	
an	
evolving	
disorder	
with	
the	
development	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
over	
time	
.	

Once	
the	
patient	
develops	
clear	
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
the	
diagnosis	
should	
be	
changed	
to	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
.	

Limited	
information	
is	
available	
on	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
prior	
to	
adolescence	
.	

Descriptions	
of	
the	
experience	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
or	
hypnagogic	
halluci-	
nations	
are	
very	
difficult	
to	
evoke	
in	
young	
patients	
,	
and	
normative	
data	
are	
not	
avail-	
able	
for	
the	
MSLT	
in	
children	
younger	
than	
six	
years	
of	
age	
.	

In	
peripubertal	
children	
and	
adolescents	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
is	
often	
challenging	
.	

The	
most	
common	
causes	
of	
short	
sleep	
latencies	
,	
often	
with	
multiple	
SOREMPs	CHEMICAL
on	
the	
MSLT	
,	
are	
chronic	
sleep	
depri-	
vation	
and	
delayed	
sleep	DISEASE
phase	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Behavioral	
problems	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
the	
onset	
of	
the	
disorder	
,	
and	
symptoms	
may	
be	
hidden	
by	
the	
patient	
.	

Inattentiveness	DISEASE
,	
lack	
of	
energy	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
bizarre	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
,	
or	
a	
combination	
thereof	
can	
lead	
to	
a	
psychiatric	DISEASE
misdiagnosis	
of	
schizophrenia	DISEASE
or	
depression	DISEASE
.	

If	
the	
MSLT	
shows	
equivocal	
results	
,	
repeating	
it	
after	
a	
time	
interval	
may	
be	
helpful	
,	
as	
SOREMPs	DISEASE
often	
emerge	
later	
in	
children	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Narcolepsy	
type	
2	
is	
most	
likely	
a	
heterogeneous	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Approximately	
24	
%	
of	
nar-	

coleptic	
patients	
without	
cataplexy	DISEASE
have	
a	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
concentration	
,	
and	
another	
8	
%	
have	
intermediate	
levels	
(	
>	
110	
pg	
/	
mL	
but	
≤	CHEMICAL
200	
pg	
/	
mL	
)	
.	

The	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
status	
of	
most	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
is	
unknown	
(	
those	
patients	
who	
are	
known	
to	
have	
absent	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
are	
classified	
as	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
)	
.	

Therefore	
,	
there	
will	
be	
a	
subgroup	
of	
about	
one	
fourth	
to	
one	
third	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
patients	
who	
will	
have	
hypocretin	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
,	
presumably	
from	
loss	
of	
the	
hypocretin	
-	
producing	
neurons	
.	

This	
group	
of	
patients	
can	
not	
be	
accurately	
separated	
clinically	
or	
by	
labora-	
tory	
tests	
(	
other	
than	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
level	
)	
from	
the	
majority	
of	
patients	
without	
cataplexy	DISEASE
who	
have	
normal	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
.	

Although	
those	
with	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
have	
a	
younger	
age	
of	
onset	
and	
their	
MSLT	
shows	
shorter	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
with	
more	
SOREMPs	DISEASE
in	
comparison	
with	
those	
with	
normal	
levels	
,	
there	
is	
too	
much	
overlap	
between	
the	
groups	
for	
these	
differences	
to	
be	
helpful	
diagnostically	
in	
individual	
patients	
.	

One	
hundred	
percent	
of	
patients	
with	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
are	
positive	
for	
HLA	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
.	

About	
26	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
normal	
levels	
are	
also	
HLA	
posi-	
tive	DISEASE
,	
a	
percentage	
not	
higher	
than	
that	
seen	
in	
the	
normal	
population	
.	

The	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
the	
remainder	
of	
patients	
who	
have	
normal	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
is	
unknown	
.	

It	
is	
possible	
some	
may	
have	
partial	
hypocretin	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
severe	
enough	
to	
cause	
sleepiness	DISEASE
but	
not	
severe	
enough	
to	
result	
in	
cataplexy	DISEASE
or	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
.	

However	
,	
support	
for	
this	
hypothesis	
is	
lacking	
in	
that	
there	
are	
no	
major	
differences	
in	
clinical	
or	
polysomnographic	
findings	
in	
those	
positive	
or	
negative	
for	
HLA	
DQB1	
*

.	

In	
the	
only	
postmortem	
study	
of	
a	
case	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
without	
cata-	
plexy	
(	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
status	
unknown	
)	
,	
the	
number	
of	
hypocretin	
cells	
was	
decreased	
but	
not	
as	
much	
as	
in	
cases	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	

It	
is	
strongly	
rcommended	
that	
the	
MSLT	
be	
preceded	
by	
at	
least	
one	
week	
of	
acti-	
graphic	
recording	
with	
a	
sleep	
log	
to	
establish	
whether	
the	
results	
could	
be	
biased	
by	
insufficient	
sleep	
,	
shift	
work	
,	
or	
another	
circadian	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

The	
MSLT	
demon-	CHEMICAL
strates	
a	
mean	
latency	
of	
less	
than	
eight	
minutes	
,	
typically	
less	
than	
five	
minutes	
,	
with	
two	
or	
more	
SOREMPs	DISEASE
or	
one	
SOREMP	DISEASE
together	
with	
a	
SOREMP	DISEASE
on	
the	
preceding	
polysomnogram	
.	

Meta	
-	
analysis	
shows	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
in	
narcoleptic	DISEASE
patients	
with	
cataplexy	DISEASE
of	
3.1	
±	
2.9	
minutes	
.	

Recent	
data	
suggest	
that	
a	
SOREMP	DISEASE
within	
15	
minutes	
of	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
is	
a	
highly	
specific	
finding	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
another	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
but	
with	
low	
sensitivity	
.	

Therefore	
,	
the	
criteria	
for	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
allow	
the	
“	
replacement	
”	
of	
one	
SOREMP	DISEASE
in	
the	
MSLT	
with	
a	
SOREMP	DISEASE
on	
the	
preceding	
poly-	
somnogram	
.	

For	
the	
correct	
interpretation	
of	
MSLT	
findings	
,	
the	
recordings	
should	
be	
performed	
with	
the	
following	
conditions	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
patient	
must	
be	
free	
of	
drugs	
that	
influence	
sleep	
for	
at	
least	
14	
days	
(	
or	
at	
least	
five	
times	
the	
half	
-	
life	
of	
the	
drug	
and	
longer	
-	
acting	
metabolite	
)	
,	
confirmed	
by	
a	
urine	
drug	
screen	
;	
(	
2	
)	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
sched-	
ule	
must	
have	
been	
standardized	
and	
,	
if	
necessary	
,	
extended	
to	
a	
minimum	
of	
seven	
hours	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
(	
longer	
for	
children	
)	
for	
at	
least	
seven	
days	
before	
polysom-	

nography	
(	
preferably	
documented	
by	
sleep	
log	
and	
,	
whenever	
possible	
,	
actigraphy	
)	
;	
and	
(	
3	
)	
nocturnal	
polysomnography	
should	
be	
performed	
on	
the	
night	
immediately	
preceding	
the	
MSLT	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
that	
could	
mimic	
the	
diagnostic	
features	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
.	

Sleep	
time	
during	
polysomnography	
should	
be	
curtailed	
as	
little	
as	
possible	
,	
with	
the	
goal	
of	
at	
least	
seven	
hours	
asleep	
.	

The	
overnight	
poly-	
somnogram	
may	
demonstrate	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
amount	
of	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
,	
and	
there	
may	
be	
a	
disruption	
of	
the	
normal	
sleep	
pattern	
,	
with	
frequent	
awakenings	
.	

REM	
sleep	
without	
atonia	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
.	

About	
45	
%	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
cases	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
HLA	
DQB1	
*	
0602	
positive	
,	
compared	
with	
12	
%	
to	
38	
%	
of	
controls	
.	

Whereas	
essentially	
all	
patients	
who	
have	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
will	
be	
positive	
,	
about	
25	
%	
of	
those	
with	
normal	
levels	
will	
also	
be	
positive	
.	

Assuming	
that	
24	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
but	
no	
cataplexy	DISEASE
will	
have	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
,	
the	
probability	
that	
an	
HLA-	
positive	
patient	
will	
have	
low	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
is	
only	
0.56	
.	

Therefore	
the	
HLA	
status	
of	
a	
patient	
can	
not	
be	
used	
to	
diagnose	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
nor	
to	
predict	
with	
high	
probability	
the	
patient	
’s	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
levels	
.

Central

,	
HLA	
typing	
should	
be	
performed	
first	
;	
if	
the	
patient	
is	
HLA	
negative	
,	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
will	
almost	
certainly	
be	
normal	
and	
the	
lumbar	
puncture	
will	
be	
unnecessary	
.	

Approximately	
24	
%	
of	
narcoleptic	DISEASE
patients	
without	
cataplexy	DISEASE
have	
a	
low	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
concentration	
and	
another	
8	
%	
have	
intermediate	
levels	
(	
>	
110	
pg	
/	
mL	
but	
≤	CHEMICAL
200	
pg/	
mL	
)	
.	

If	
the	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
of	
such	
patients	
are	
known	
to	
be	
low	
,	
they	
are	
classified	
as	
narcolepsy	DISEASE

1	
,	
but	
the	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	
status	
will	
not	
be	
known	
for	
most	
of	
these	
patients	
.	

Possible	
indications	
for	
considering	
measuring	
CSF	
Hcrt-1	CHEMICAL
levels	
as	
a	
diag-	
nostic	
procedure	
would	
be	
the	
presence	
of	
disorders	
such	
as	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
the	
use	
of	
psychotropic	
medications	
that	
may	
complicate	
interpretation	
of	
an

Narcolepsy	
type	
1	
is	
diagnosed	
if	
cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
present	
or	
the	
CSF	
hypocretin	
levels	
are	
known	
to	
be	
low	
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
with	
idiopathic	DISEASE
hyper-	DISEASE
somnia	DISEASE
may	
have	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
on	
MSLT	
similar	
to	
those	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
,	
but	
have	
fewer	
than	
two	
SOREMPs	DISEASE
on	
MSLT	
and	
the	
preceding	
polysomnogram	
combined	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
patients	
with	
idiopathic	DISEASE
hypersomnia	DISEASE
generally	
have	
high	
sleep	
efficiency	
,	
sleep	
drunkenness	
,	
and	
long	
,	
unrefreshing	
naps	
.	

Sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
be	
secondary	
to	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
(	
OSA	DISEASE
)	
,	
insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
shift	
work	
,	
the	
effects	
of	
substances	
or	
medications	
,	
or	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Many	
of	
these	
conditions	
can	
result	
in	
early	
-	
onset	
REM	
sleep	
,	
so	
their	
clinical	
and	
polysomnographic	
exclusion	
is	
essential	
before	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
is	
made	
.	

However	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
does	
not	
preclude	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
if	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
REM	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
persist	
after	
adequate	
treatment	
of	
the	
initial	
disorder	
.	

Chronic	
fatigue	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
and	
depression	DISEASE
may	
mimic	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
but	
do	
not	
show	
the	
typical	
MSLT	
findings	
.	

Malingering	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
substance	DISEASE
abuse	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
be	
considered	
in	
patients	
who	
try	
to	
mislead	
the	
clinician	
in	
order	
to	
obtain	
stimulant	
medications	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Excluding	
the	
minority	
of	
patients	
with	
definite	
hypocretin	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
,	
the	
underlying	
biology	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
without	
the	
presence	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
is	
unknown	
.	

It	
is	
not	
estab-	
lished	
whether	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
is	
a	
homogeneous	
or	
heterogeneous	
condition	
.	

It	
is	
uncertain	
whether	
or	
not	
some	
patients	
have	
partial	
hypocretin	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
not	
iden-	
tifiable	
from	
CSF	
measurements	
.	

Further	
advances	
in	
classification	
will	
depend	
on	
answers	
to	
these	
unknowns	
.	

Further	
studies	
on	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
are	
needed	
to	
determine	
the	
cause	
of	
the	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
and	
the	
risk	
of	
development	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
over	
time	
.

Great	
caution	
should	
be	
exercised	
to

other	
conditions	
that	
might	
mimic	
the	
disorder

A	
repeat

is	
advisable	
if	
the	
clinical	
suspicion

,	
and

not	
adequately	
explained

Objective	
evidence

36	
%	
to	
66	
%	
of	
patients

Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
The	
2005	
2nd	
edition	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
divided	
IH	
into	
two	
disorders	
:	
IH	
with	
long	
sleep	
time	
,	
and	
IH	
without	
long	
sleep	
time	
.	

IH	
is	
likely	
a	
heterogeneous	
condition	
,	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
which	
is	
currently	
unknown	
.	

However	
,	
recent	
studies	
suggest	
that	
a	
division	
of	
the	
disorder	
based	
on	
the	
length	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
lacks	
validity	
.	

Comparison	
of	
patients	
with	
≥	
10	
hours	
of	
sleep	
to	
those	
with	
<	
10	
hours	
show	
no	
differences	
in	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
scores	
,	
MSLT	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
,	
or	
percentage	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
drunkenness	DISEASE
,	
unrefreshing	
naps	
,	
hypnago-	
gic	
hallucinations	DISEASE
,	
or	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

The	
only	
reported	
differences	
are	
that	
the	
group	
with	
long	
sleep	
is	
somewhat	
younger	
and	
thinner	
,	
with	
lower	
Horne	
-	
Ostberg	
scores	
and	
marginally	
higher	
sleep	
efficiency	
.	

If	
MSLT	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
are	
not	
used	
as	
a	
diagnostic	
criterion	
,	
the	
distribution	
of	
latencies	
is	
unimodal	
,	
suggesting	
no	
sepa-	
rate	
subtypes	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
an	
actigraphy	
study	
has	
shown	
that	
patients	
with	
IH	
tend	
to	
overestimate	
their	
sleep	
time	
by	
a	
mean	
of	
0.99	
hours	
,	
thus	
making	
the	
fundamental	
criterion	
for	
distinguishing	
between	
patients	
with	
long	
and	
shorter	
sleep	
inaccurate	
.	

Clinicians	
may	
wish	
to	
continue	
to	
note	
sleep	
duration	
as	
an	
important	
clinical	
feature	
,	
but	
the	
caveats	
discussed	
above	
should	
be	
clearly	
considered	
.	

Any	
future	
separation	
of	
IH	
into	
distinct	
conditions	
must	
await	
advances	
in	
understanding	
the	
underlying	
biology	
.	

Demographics	
Prevalence	
and	
incidence	
of	
IH	
are	
not	
known	
.	

Some	
studies	
have	
suggested	
a	
higher	
prevalence	
in	
women	
.

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	

In	
contrast	
to	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
the	
disorder	
is	
not	
known	
to	
be	
HLA	
associated	
,	
and	
no	
con-	
sistent	
precipitating	
factor	
has	
been	
identified	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

A	
familial	
predisposition	
to	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
but	
rigorous	
studies	
have	
not	
been	
performed	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
IH	
in	
different	
series	
is	
16.6–21.2	
years	
.	

Once	
established	
,	
the	
disorder	
is	
generally	
stable	
in	
severity	
and	
long	
lasting	
,	
although	
a	
spontaneous	
remission	
rate	
of	
14	
%	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
one	
series	
.	

Complications	
are	
mostly	
social	
and	
professional	
,	
and	
include	
poor	
work	
or	
school	
performance	
,	
reduced	
earnings	
,	
and	
loss	
of	
employment	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
IH	
frequently	
develops	
in	
adolescence	
.	

Exclusion	
of	
other	
causes	
of	
hypersomno-	
lence	
in	
that	
age	
group	
,	
including	
delayed	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
,	
obstructive	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
,	
insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
and	
use	
of	
recreational	
drugs	
,	
is	
essential	
.	

Early	
in	
the	
development	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
SOREMPs	DISEASE
may	
not	
be	
present	
on	
MSLT	
;	
therefore	
,	
some	
patients	
may	
need	
to	
be	
reclassified	
later	
as	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
.	

If	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
total	
sleep	
time	
is	
used	
to	
confirm	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
IH	
in	
a	
child	
or	
adolescent	
,	
normal	
values	
may	
need	
to	
be	
adapted	
to	
account	
for	
changes	
in	
sleep	
time	
associated	
with	
stages	
of	
development

Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
of	
IH	
is	
unknown	
.	

Neurochemical	
studies	
measuring	
monoamine	
metabolites	
in	
the	
CSF	DISEASE
have	
been	
inconclusive	
.	

CSF	
hypocretin-1	
concentrations	
in	
patients	
with	
IH	
are	
normal	
.	

CSF	
histamine	CHEMICAL
levels	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
low	
in	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
and	
IH	
,	
but	
a	
recent	
study	
did	
not	
confirm	
these	
findings	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnographic	
monitoring	
generally	
demonstrates	
NREM	
and	
REM	
sleep	
in	
expected	
proportions	
with	
normal	
REM	
latency	
.	

Total	
sleep	
time	
is	
often	
prolonged	
.	

Sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
should	
be	
either	
absent	
or	
adequately	
treated	
before	
diagnosing	
this	
disor-	
der	DISEASE
,	
with	
special	
attention	
paid	
to	
excluding	
significant	
respiratory	
effort	
related	
arous-	
als	
.	

The	
MSLT	
should	
not	
show	
more	
than	
one	
SOREMP	DISEASE
(	
or	
none	
if	
a	
SOREMP	DISEASE
was	
observed	
on	
the	
preceding	
night	
’s	
polysomnogram	
(	
PSG	
)	
)	
.	

The	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
on	
the	
MSLT	
is	
usually	
shorter	
than	
in	
controls	
but	
longer	
than	
in	
most	
patients	
with	
nar-	
colepsy	
,	
averaging	
8.3	
and	
7.8	
minutes	
in	
two	
large	
studies	
.	

In	
patients	
with	
MSLT	
mean	
latencies	
>	
8	
minutes	
,	
prolonged	
sleep	
monitoring	
should	
be	
performed	
by	
polysomnography	
(	
24	
hours	
)	
or	
wrist	
actigraphy	
(	
7	
days	
with	
unre-	
stricted	
sleep	
)	
after	
correction	
of	
sleep	
deprivation	
,	
exclusion	
of	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
and	
discontinuation	
of	
sedating	
medication	
as	
required	
for	
an	
MSLT	
(

Narcolepsy	DISEASE

Objective	
Findings	
)	
.	

Total	
24	
-	
hour	
sleep	
time	
in	
adults	
(	
major	
sleep	
episode	
plus	
naps	
)	
must	
be	
≥	
660	
minutes	
(	
note	
that	
the	
use	
of	
24	
-	
hour	
PSG	
monitoring	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
IH	CHEMICAL
has	
been	
validated	
against	
controls	
,	
but	
the	
use	
of	
seven	
days	
of	
actigraphic	
mon-	DISEASE
itoring	
still	
awaits	
validation	
)	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
IH	
may	
be	
confused	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
especially	
when	
respiratory	
-	
related	
arousals	DISEASE
(	
rather	
than	
apneas	
or	
hypopneas	DISEASE
)	
are	
present	
.	

Narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
2	
is	
distinguished	
from	
IH	
by	
the	
presence	
of	
two	
or	
more	
sleep	
onset	
REM	
periods	
on	
the	
MSLT	
or	
preceding	
PSG	
.	

Insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
must	
be	
carefully	
excluded	
by	
extending	
the	
patient	
’s	
sleep	
before	
testing	
.	

Historical	
information	
,	
physical	
examination	
,	
and	
,	
if	
indicated	
,	
laboratory	
testing	
including	
brain	
imaging	
should	
help	
rule	
out	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disorder	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
posttraumatic	DISEASE
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
,	
residual	
hyper-	
somnolence	DISEASE
following	
adequate	
treatment	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
,	
and	
sleep	
fragmentation	
due	
to	
pain	DISEASE
may	
mimic	
IH	
.	

Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
must	
be	
considered	
and	
ruled	
out	
by	
discontinuation	
of	
possible	
causative	
agents	
,	
if	
clinically	
appropriate	
.	

Hypersomnia	DISEASE
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
be	
consid-	
ered	
in	
patients	
with	
a	
psychiatric	DISEASE
condition	
,	
most	
typically	
depression	DISEASE
.	

The	
complaint	
of	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
prolonged	
sleep	
may	
be	
rather	
similar	
to	
that	
of	
patients	
with	
IH	
,	
except	
that	
it	
may	
vary	
from	
day	
to	
day	
and	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
poor	
sleep	
at	
night	
.	

The	
MSLT	
in	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
does	
not	
demonstrate	
a	
short	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
.	

Chronic	
fatigue	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
character-	
ized	
by	
persistent	
or	
relapsing	
fatigue	DISEASE
that	
does	
not	
resolve	
with	
sleep	
or	
rest	
.	

Patients	
clearly	
complain	
of	
fatigue	DISEASE
rather	
than	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
and	
the	
mean	
MSLT	
sleep	
latency	
is	
normal	
.	

Long	
sleepers	
feel	
fully	
refreshed	
and	
do	
not	
experience	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
if	
they	
are	
allowed	
to	
sleep	
as	
long	
as	
they	
need	
,	
in	
contrast	
with	
patients	
with	
IH	
who	
continue	
to	
feel	
sleepy	
regardless	
of	
prior	
sleep	
duration	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Future	
Directions	

There	
is	
a	
paucity	
of	
knowledge	
regarding	
the	
neurobiology	
of	
IH	
.	

Further	
research	
in	
this	
area	
,	
as	
well	
as	
more	
precise	
characterization	
of	
clinical	
characteristics	
and	
treat-

is

Essential	
Features	
Kleine	
-	
Levin	
syndrome	
is	
characterized	
by	
relapsing	
-	
remitting	
episodes	
of	
severe	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
in	
association	
with	
cognitive	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
psychiatric	DISEASE
,	
and	
behavioral	
distur-	
bances	
.	

A	
typical	
episode	
lasts	
a	
median	
10	
days	
(	
range	
,	
2.5–80	
days	
)	
,	
with	
rare	
epi-	
sodes	
lasting	
several	
weeks	
to	
months	
.	

The	
first	
episode	
is	
often	
triggered	
by	
an	
infec-	
tion	
or	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
intake	
,	
with	
further	
episodes	
recurring	
every	
1–12	
months	
(	
median	
three	
months	
)	
for	
years	
.	

During	
episodes	
,	
patients	
may	
sleep	
as	
long	
as	
16	
to	
20	
hours	
per	
day	
,	
waking	
or	
getting	
up	
only	
to	
eat	
and	
void	
(	
incontinence	DISEASE
is	
not	
observed	
)	
.	

They	
remain	
rousable	
,	
but	
are	
irritable	DISEASE
if	
prevented	
from	
sleeping	
.	

When	
they	
are	
awake	
during	
episodes	
,	
most	
patients	
are	
exhausted	
,	
apathetic	DISEASE
,	
confused	
,	
and	
slow	
in	
speaking	
and	
answering	
.	

Anterograde	
amnesia	DISEASE
is	
typical	
.	

Almost	
all	
report	
a	
dreamlike	
,	
altered	
perception	
of	
the	
environment	
(	
derealization	
)	
.	

Less	
commonly	
,	
patients	
eat	
ravenously	
(	
66	
%	
,	
although	
one	
third	
eat	
less	
)	
,	
are	
hypersexual	DISEASE
(	
53	
%	
,	
principally	
men	
)	
,	
childish	
,	
depressed	DISEASE
(	
53	
%	
,	
predominantly	
women	
)	
,	
and	
anxious	
at	
being	
left	
alone	
and	
seeing	
strangers	
,	
and	
experience	
hallucinations	DISEASE
and	
delusions	DISEASE
(	
30	
%	
)	
.	

Patients	
are	
remark-	
ably	
normal	
between	
episodes	
with	
regard	
to	
sleep	
,	
cognition	
,	
mood	
,	
and	
eating	
.	

The	
disease	
typically	
resolves	
after	
a	
median	
of	
14	
years	
,	
except	
in	
adult	
-	
onset	
cases	
,	
when	
the	
course	
may	
be	
more	
prolonged	
.	

The	
simultaneous	
occurrence	
of	
all	
these	
symp-	
toms	
is	
the	
exception	
rather	
than	
the	
rule	
,	
with	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
being	
more	
char-	
acteristic	
at	
the	
disease	
onset	
and	
during	
the	
first	
part	
of	
the	
episodes	
,	
and	
disinhib-	
ited	
behaviors	
being	
evident	
during	
only	
a	
few	
episodes	
.	

In	
occasional	
cases	
,	
isolated	
recurrent	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
may	
be	
the	
only	
symptom	
.	

Amnesia	DISEASE
,	
transient	
dysphoria	DISEASE
,	
or	
elation	DISEASE
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
signal	
the	
termination	
of	
an	
episode	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Physical	
examination	
is	
unremarkable	
,	
except	
for	
general	
psychomotor	
slowing	
.	

Social	
and	
occupational	
impairment	
during	
attacks	DISEASE
is	
often	
severe	
,	
with	
teenagers	
bedridden	
for	
days	
,	
but	
can	
be	
variable	
depending	
on	
the	
frequency	
,	
severity	
,	
and	
duration	
of	
episodes

disease	
duration	
.	

Complications	
are	
mainly	
social	
and	
occupational	
.	

In	
rare	
cases	
,	
subjects	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
choke	
while	
eating	
voraciously	
,	
to	
have	
suicidal	
thoughts	
,	
or	
to	
be	
involved	
in	
a	
car	
accident	
.	

A	
reduced	
long

term	
working	
memory	
capacity	
following	
episodes	
was	
reported	
in	
eight	
patients	
with	
Kleine

.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Adolescents	
are	
affected	
in	
most	
cases	
.	

However	
,	
the	
onset	
of	
the	
condition	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
children	
as	
young	
as	
four	
years	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Postmortem	
examination	
of	
the	
central	
nervous	
system	
has	
been	
performed	
in	
only	
four	
cases	
,	
with	
inconsistent	
findings	
.	

One	
subject	
showed	
significant	
perivascular	
lymphocytic	
infiltrations	
in	
the	
hypothalamus	
,	
amygdala	
,	
and	
the	
grey	
matter	
of	
the	
temporal	
lobes	
;	
a	
second	
demonstrated	
similar	
infiltrations	
in	
the	
thalamus	
;	
and	
a	
third	
in	
the	
diencephalon	
and	
the	
midbrain	
with	
a	
suggestion	
of	
mild	
localized	
encephali-	
tis	
.	

In	
the	
fourth	
case	
,	
a	
smaller	
locus	
coeruleus	
and	
decreased	
pigmentation	
in	
the	
substantia	
nigra	
were	
reported	
.	

Magnetic	
resonance	
imaging	
was	
unremarkable	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
functional	
brain	
imaging	
studies	
during	
episodes	
are	
frequently	
abnormal	
,	
showing	
hypometabolism	
in	
the	
thalamus	
,	
hypothalamus	
,	
mesial	
temporal	
lobe	
,	
and	
frontal	
lobe	
.	

Some	
of	
these	
abnormalities	
persist	
during	
asymptomatic	
periods	
in	
half	
of	
the	
patients	
.	

An	
autoimmune	
basis	
for	
the	
disorder	
is	
suggested	
clinically	
(	
onset	
occurs	
during	
adolescence	
,	
often	
in	
conjunction	
with	
an	
infection	DISEASE
)	
and	
by	
the	
occa-

association	
with

Objective	
Findings	
Routine	
electroencephalograms	
obtained	
during

Polysomnography	
studies	
are	
often	
difficult	
to	
interpret	
,	
and	
results	
are	
depen-	
dent	
on	
the	
duration	
of	
recording	
(	
overnight	
vs.	
24

hour	
monitoring	
)	
as	
well	
as	
the	
timing	
(	
at	
the	
beginning	
versus	
the	
end	
of	
episodes	
or	
at	
onset	
of	
the	
disease	
or	
later	
in	
its	
course	
)

)	
,	
and	
18

or	
more	
in	
some	
reports	
.	

During	
nocturnal	
polysomnography	
in	
17	
children	
,	
nighttime

was	
decreased	
during	
the

decreased	
during	
the

CSF	
levels	
of	
hypocretin-1	
were	
within	
normal	
range	
in	
16	
patients	
,	
although	
intraepisodic	
levels	
are	
lower	
than	
interepisodic	
levels

Computed

are	
normal

abnormal	
in	
most	
cases

with	
hypoperfusion	DISEASE
of	
the	
left	
or	
right	
temporal	
and	
frontal	
lobes	
as	
well	
as	
the	
diencephalon

These	
abnor-

are	
present	
during	
the	
episode	
of

sometimes	
between	
episodes

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Recurrent	
waxing	
and	
waning	
episodes	
of

may	
be	
secondary	
to

Recurrent

However	
,	
the	
onset	
and	
offset	
of	
symptoms	
are	
less	
abrupt	
than	
in	
Kleine

Levin	
syndrome	
and	
persist	
to	
some	
extent

Other	
differential

due	
to	
a	
medication	
or

,	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,

,	
and	
insufficient

In	
these	
disor-

,	
however	
,	
the	
complaint	
of	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
occurs	
daily	
and	
is	
usually	
not	
recurrent	
or	
periodic	
.	

There	
is	
no	
evidence	
that	
Kleine

occurs	
as	
a

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Future	
Directions	

The	
pathophysiology	
of	
this	
disorder	
is	
not	
known	
.	

Evidence	
to	
date	
suggests	
that	
a	
localized	
but	
multifocal	
encephalopathy	DISEASE
occurs	
during	
episodes	
of	
Kleine	
-	
Levin	
syn-	
drome	
,	
as	
functional	
imaging	
and	
electroencephalography	
(	
EEG	
)	
slowing	
indicate	
tha-	
lamic	
,	
temporal	
,	
and	
frontal	
lobe	
involvement	
.	

The	
cause

may	
be	
genetic	
,	
autoimmune

a	
diagnosis	
of

excessive	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
or	
excessive

severity	
and	
may	
resemble	
that	
of

breathing	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
and	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a

,	
the

made	
only	
if	
the	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
persists	
after	
adequate	
treatment	
of	
the

Subtypes	
Many

conditions	
can	
cause	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE

Hypersomnia	DISEASE
secondary	
to	
Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
:	
Significant	
hypersomnolence	
docu-	
mented	
by	
MSLT	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
some	
cases	
of	
Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
.	

Hypersomnia	DISEASE
in	
Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
may	
be	
due	
to	
insufficient	
control	
of	
nocturnal	
symptoms	
,	
result-	
ing	
in	
insufficient	
sleep	
and	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

If	
so	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
should	
be	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Cases	
of	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
that	
are	
due	
to	
the	
side	
effects	
of	
dopaminergic	
agents	
should	
be	
coded	
as	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
.	

In	
other	
cases	
,	
however	
,	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
is	
likely	
of	
central	
origin	
and	
should	
be	
classified	
in	
this	
section	
.	

Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
patients	
with	
an	
MSLT	
profile	
consistent	
with	
narco-

should	
be	
coded	
as	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medical	
condition	
.	

Posttraumatic	
hypersomnia	DISEASE

Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
appears	
to	
be	
common	
after	
trau-	CHEMICAL

brain	DISEASE
injury	DISEASE
(

,	
with	
one	
meta	
-	
analysis	
suggesting	
a	
frequency	
of	
28	
%	
of	
TBI	DISEASE
patients	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
this	
may	
be	
caused	
by	
injury	
to	
the	
hypocretin	
/	
orexin	
neurons	
or	
other	
wake

promoting	
neural	
systems

However	
,	
the

of

disorder	DISEASE
(	
SRBD	
)	
in	
patients	
with	
head	DISEASE
trauma	DISEASE
is	
high	
(	
frequency	
23

to	
25	
%	
)	
.	

The	
nature	
of	
the	
relationship	
between	
TBI	DISEASE
and	
OSA	DISEASE
remains	
undefined	
.	

Therefore	
,	
control	
of	
other

is	
necessary	
prior

X	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
are	
other	
examples	
of	
centrally	
mediated	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

A	
number	
of	
genetic	
disorders	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
associated	
with	
both	
sleep	DISEASE
disordered	DISEASE
breathing	DISEASE
and	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
myotonic	DISEASE
dystrophy	DISEASE
and	
Prader	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
Willi	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
)	
.	

In	
these	
cases	
,	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disorder	
should	
be	
diagnosed	
only	
if	
the	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
still	
present	
after	
adequate	
treatment	
of	
the	
SRBD	
.	

Smith

Magenis	
syndrome	
is	
a	
neurodevelopmental	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
characterized	
by	
dysmorphic	
facial	
features	
,	
behavioral	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
with	
onset	
in	
early	
childhood	
,	
daytime	DISEASE
somnolence	DISEASE
,	
and	
night	
awakenings	
in	
association	
with	
reversal	
in	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
secretion	
pattern	
(	
i.e.	
,	
the	
serum	
levels	
of

are	
high	
during	
the	
daytime	
and	
low	
at	
night

neurodegenerative	
lesions	
of	
the

,	
especially	
in	
the	
hypothalamus	
or	
rostral	
midbrain	
,	
may	
produce	
daytime	
sleepi-	
ness	
.	

In	
patients	
with	
brain	DISEASE
tumors	DISEASE
,	
the	
sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
be	
due	
to	
the	
tumor	DISEASE
itself	
or	
the	
effects	
of	
treatment	
.	

Hypersomnia	DISEASE
secondary	
to	
endocrine	DISEASE

:	
Hypothyroidism	DISEASE
is	
the	
most	
recog-

example	
of	
this	
condition

,	
and	
certain	
inherited	
metabolic	DISEASE

may	
result	
in	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE

Residual	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
in	
patients	
with	
adequately	
treated	
OSA	DISEASE
:	
Some	
patients	
with	
SRBDs	DISEASE
report	
persistent	
sleepiness	DISEASE
despite	
apparently	
adequate	
amounts	
of	
sleep	
and	
optimal	
treatment	
of	
their	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
and	
other	
known	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

They	
may	
have	
moderately	
elevated	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
scores	
,	
but	
most	
have	
mean	
sleep	
laten-	
cies	
>	
8	
minutes	
on	
MSLT	
.	

They	
also	
report	
more	
fatigue	DISEASE
,	
apathy	DISEASE
,	
and	
depression	DISEASE
.	

It	
is	
essential	
that	
sleep	
disordered	
breathing	
be	
fully	
treated	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
,	
and	
that	
control	
of	
the	
SRBD	
be	
confirmed	
by

and	
(

psychiatric	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
or	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
related	
to	
medications	
or

must	
be	
eliminated	
.	

Animal	
studies	
have	
suggested	
this	
residual	
sleepiness	DISEASE
could	
be	
caused	
by	
hypoxic	DISEASE
injury	DISEASE

Developmental	
Issues	
Daytime	
naps	
are	
normal	
in	
children	
younger	
than	
3	
-	
4	
years	
;	
thus	
,	
it	
is	
difficult	
to	
dif-	
ferentiate	
physiologic	
napping	DISEASE
from	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
in	
children	
younger	
than	
this	
age	
.	

Inattentiveness	DISEASE
,

often	
accompany

Reference	
values	
for	
the	
MSLT	
in	
children	
differ	
from	
those

,	
and	
this	
issue	
should	
be	
considered	
during

in	
the	
amount	
of	
slow

sleep	
.	

MSLT	
must	
show	
fewer

2	
SOREMPs	DISEASE
and	
usually	
will	
show	
a	
mean

If	
clin-	
ically	
significant	
sleep

,	
they	
should

major	
chal-

in	
establishing	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medical

is	
deter-	
mining	
whether	
the	
associated	
medical	
or	
neurological	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
truly	
causing	
the	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE

Clinical	
and	
Pathological	
Subtypes	
Hypersomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
sedating	
medications	
:	
Sedation	
is	
a	
common	
side	
effect	
of	
many	
prescription	
medications	
including	
benzodiazepines	CHEMICAL
,	
nonbenzodiazepine	CHEMICAL
hypnot-	
ics	
,	
opioids	
,	
barbiturates	
,	
anticonvulsants	
,	
antipsychotics	
,	
anticholinergics	
,	
and	
some	
antidepressants	CHEMICAL
and	
antihistamines	CHEMICAL
.	

Sleepiness	DISEASE
also	
can	
occur	
with	
some	
dopamine	CHEMICAL
agonists	
such	
as	
pramipexole	CHEMICAL
or	
ropinirole	CHEMICAL
,	
and	
with	
many	
antiseizure	DISEASE
medications	
.	

Though	
less	
common	
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
can	
also	
occur	
with	
nonsteroidal	
anti	
-	
inflammatory	
drugs	
,	
some	
antibiotics	
,	
antispasmodics	
,	
antiarryhthmics	
,	
and	
beta	
-	
blockers	
.	

Over	
-	
the-	
counter	
medications	
,	
such	
as	
valerian	CHEMICAL
and	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
,	
can	
produce	
sedation	
.	

Excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
especially	
common	
when	
these	
drugs	
are	
used	
in	
elderly	
patients	
or	
those	
with	
multiple	
medical	
conditions	
,	
or	
in	
combination	
.	

Some	
tolerance	
to	
the	
sedative	
effects	
can	
occur	
with	
time	
.	

Hypersomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
substance	DISEASE
abuse	DISEASE
:	
Daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
can	
occur	
with	
abuse	
of	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
,	
benzodiazepines	CHEMICAL
,	
barbiturates	
,	
gamma	CHEMICAL
hydroxybutyrate	CHEMICAL
,	
opiates	
,	
and	
marijuana	
.	

Hypersomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
stimulant	
withdrawal	
:	
Daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
common	
with	
abrupt	
discontinuation	
of	
stimulants	CHEMICAL
.	

In	
chronically	
heavy	
amphetamine	CHEMICAL
users	
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
most	
severe	
in	
the	
first	
week	
of	
withdrawal	
and	
can	
persist	
for	
up	
to	
three	
weeks	
;	
indi-	
viduals	
may	
have	
an	
increase	
in	
total	
sleep	
and	
daytime	
napping	
,	
but	
sleep	
may	
seem	
fragmented	
and	
nonrestorative	DISEASE
.	

Significant	
depression	DISEASE
often	
accompanies	
the	
hyper-	DISEASE
somnolence	DISEASE
.	

Infrequently	
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
be	
a	
residual	
complaint	
in	
those	
who	
have	
used	
stimulants	CHEMICAL
in	
the	
past	
but	
have	
been	
abstinent	
for	
many	
years	
.	

In	
people	
who	
regularly	
consume	
coffee	
or	
other	
sources	
of	
caffeine	CHEMICAL
,	
discontinuation	
can	
produce	
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
fatigue	DISEASE
,	
and	
inattentiveness	DISEASE
for	
two	
to	
nine	
days	
.	

Demographics	
Patients	
of	
any	
age	
can	
experience	
sleepiness	DISEASE
from	
sedating	
medications	
.	

Stimulant	
abuse	
and	
the	
consequent	
sleepiness	DISEASE
during	
withdrawal	
are	
most	
common	
in	
adoles-	
cents	
and	
young	
adults	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Sleepiness	
from	
sedating	
medications	
may	
be	
more	
common	
in	
older	
patients	
and	
in	
those	
with	
multiple	
medical	
problems

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnography	
is	
generally	
unnecessary	
unless	
a	
concomitant	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
sus-	
pected	
.	

Polysomnography	
and	
MSLT	
results	
vary	
depending	
on	
the	
specific	
substance	
in	
question	
and	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
most	
recent	
intake	
.	

With	
stimulant	
withdrawal	
,	
noc-	
turnal	
polysomnography	
may	
show	
normal	
sleep	
,	
whereas	
the	
MSLT	
typically	
demon-	CHEMICAL
strates	
a	
short	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
with	
or	
without	
multiple	
SOREMPs	CHEMICAL
.	

A	
urine	
tox-	
icology	
screen	
may	
be	
positive	
for	
the	
suspected

The	
diagnosis	
is	
often	
confirmed	
if

Although

it

A.	

The	
patient	
has	
daily	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
to	
sleep	
or	
daytime	
lapses	
into	
sleep	
occurring	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
.	

B.	
The	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
occurs	
in	
association	
with	
a	
concurrent	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

C.	

The	
symptoms	
are	
not

.	

Essential	
Features	
Patients	
with	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
report	
excessive	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
or	
excessive	
napping	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
they	
often	
feel	
their	
sleep	
is	
of	
poor	
quality	
and	
nonrestorative	DISEASE
.	

Patients	
are	
often	
intensely	
focused	
on	
their	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
,	
and	
psychiatric	DISEASE
symptoms	
may	
become	
apparent	
only	
after	
prolonged	
interviews	
or	
psychometric	
testing	
.	

Associated	
psychiatric	DISEASE
conditions	
include	
mood	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
conversion	
or	
undifferentiated	DISEASE
somatoform	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
and	
less	
frequently	
other	
mental	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
schizoaffective	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
adjustment	
disor-	
der	
,	
or	
personality	
disorders	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Poor	
work	
attendance	
,	
spending	
full	
days	
in

several	
times	
a	
week	
,	
or	
abruptly	
leaving	
work	
because	
of	
a	
perceived	
need	
to	
sleep	
are	
common	
symptoms	
.	

Patients	
may	
also	
have	
social	
withdrawal	
,	
apathy	DISEASE
,	
and	
feelings	
of	
low	
energy	
.	

Clinical

Pathological	
Subtypes	
Hypersomnia	DISEASE

:	

Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
in	
the	
context	
of	
depression	DISEASE
is	
a	
frequent	
feature	
of	
atypical	
depression	DISEASE
and	
bipolar	DISEASE
II	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
recur-

carbohydrates	
,	
and

are	
reported	
.	

MSLT	
results	
are	
usually	
normal	
,	
but	
long	
hours	
spent	
in

are	
reported

.	

Demographics	
Hypersomnia	DISEASE
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
accounts	
for	
5	
%	
to	
7	
%	
of	
hyper-	
somnolence	DISEASE
cases	
.	

Women	
are	
more	
susceptible	
than	
men	
,	
and	
the	
typical	
age	
range	
is	
between	
20	
and	
50	
years	
.	

In	
patients	
with	
major	DISEASE
depression	DISEASE
,	
the	
prevalence	
of	
hypersom-	
nolence	
ranges	
from	
5	
%	
to	
over	
50	
%	
depending	
on	
how	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
is	
defined	
.	

Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
affects	
over	
50	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
seasonal	DISEASE
affective	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Not	
applicable	
or	
known	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Not	
known	
,	
except	
for	
the	
familial	
patterns	
of	
certain	
psychiatric	
disorders	
(	
e.g.	
,	
bipolar	DISEASE
II	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
)	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
is	
usually	
in	
the	
third	
decade	
in	
both	
sexes	
.	

With	
major	
depres-	
sion	
,	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
may	
persist	
even	
after	
the	
depressive	DISEASE
episode	
improves	
,	
and	
persistent	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
is	
associated	
with	
increased	
risk	
of	
recurrent	
depression	DISEASE
.	

Complications	
are	
mostly	
social	
and	
occupational	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Hypersomnolence	DISEASE
occurs	
in	
10	
%	
to	
20	
%	
of	
children	
with	
major	DISEASE
depression	DISEASE
,	
some-	
times	
in	
combination	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
but	
sleep	
quality	
appears	
normal	
.	

Although	
sleep	
problems	
may	
develop	
at	
any	
stage	
of	
depression	DISEASE
,	
they	
are	
most	
pronounced	
during	
the	
acute	
phase	
.	

Children	
and	
adolescents	
with	
depression	DISEASE
who	
manifest	
either	
insomnia	DISEASE
or	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
generally	
manifest	
more	
pronounced	
symptoms	
,	
such	
as	
anhedo-	
nia	
and	
weight	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
underlying	
cause	
is	
unknown	
.	

Although	
patients	
with	
this	
disorder	
report	
sleep-	
iness	
,	
sleep	
studies	
reveal	
little	
or	
no	
evidence	
of	
increased	
propensity	
to	
sleep	
.	

In	
some	
patients	
,	
fragmented	
nighttime	
sleep	
may	
contribute	
to	
their	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Because	
of	
uncertainty	
about	
the	
nature	
of	
the	
relationship	
,	
the	
term	
“	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
associated	
with	
a	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
”	
is	
preferred	
to	
“	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
psychi-	
atric	
disorder	
.	
”	

Objective	
Findings	
Nocturnal	
polysomnography	
typically	
shows	
a	
prolonged	
total	
time	
in	
bed	
with	
frag-	
mented	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
latency	
is	
prolonged	
,	
wake	
time	
after	
sleep	
onset	
is	
increased	
,	
awakenings	
may	
be	
frequent	
and	
prolonged	
,	
and	
sleep	
efficiency	
is	
low	
.	

REM	
sleep	
latency	
may	
be	
shortened	
in	
the	
case	
of	
untreated	
depression	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
latencies	
on	
the	
MSLT	
are	
often	
within	
normal	
limits	
,	
a	
result	
contrasting	
with	
the	
subjective	
complaint	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
an	
elevated	
score	
on	
the	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
.	

24	
-	
hour	
continuous	
sleep	
-	
recording	
studies	
typically	
show	
considerable	
time	
spent	
in	
bed	
during	
day	
and	
night	
,	
a	
behavior	
sometime	
referred	
to	
as	
clinophilia	
.	

Psychiatric	
inter-	
views	
and	
evaluations	
are	
essential	
to	
diagnose	
the	
underlying	
psychiatric	DISEASE
condition	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
As	
there	
are	
no	
definitive	
tests	
for	
diagnosing	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
associated	
with	
a	
psy-	
chiatric	
disorder	
,	
it	
is	
essential	
to	
rule	
out	
other	
common	
causes	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
such	
as	
insufficient	
sleep	
,	
sedation	
from	
medications	
or	
substances	
,	
SRBD	
,	
periodic	
limb	
movement	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
and	
IH	
.	

Chronic	
fatigue	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
persistent	
or	
relapsing	
fatigue	DISEASE
that	
does	
not	
resolve	
with	
sleep	
or	
rest	
,	
but	
the	
main	
complaint	
is	
usually	
fatigue	DISEASE
rather	
than	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
associated	
with	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
impaired	
concentration	
,	
and	
lowered	
energy	
level	
,	
but	
a	
detailed	
history	
of	
the	
subject	
’s	
current	
sleep	
schedule	
reveals	
chronic	
sleep	
deprivation	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Future	
Directions	

The	
lack	
of	
concordance	
between	
subjective	
and	
objective	
findings	
raises	
multiple	
issues	
.	

It	
is	
unclear	
to	
what	
extent	
these	
patients	
are	
objectively	
sleepy	
or	
,	
instead	
,	
suffer	
from	
decreased	
energy	
and	
lack	
of	
interest	
that	
confines	
them	
to	
bed	
.	

More	
research	
is	
needed	
to	
create	
an	
effective	
definition	
of	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
in	
this	
population	
and	
to	
develop	
tools	
for	
measuring	
it	
.	

Finally	
,	
future	
efforts	
should	
define	
the	
mechanism	
through	
which	
some	
patients	
express	
their	
psychiatric	DISEASE
symptoms	
as	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.

A.	

The	
patient	
has	
daily	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
to	
sleep	
or	
daytime	
lapses	
into	
sleep	
or	
,	
in	
the	
case	
of	
prepubertal	
children	
,	
there	
is	
a	
complaint	
of	
behavioral	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
attributable	
to	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

B.	
The	
patient	
’s	
sleep	
time	
,	
established	
by	
personal	
or	
collateral	
history	
,	
sleep	
logs	
,	
or	
actigraphy1	DISEASE
is	
usually	
shorter	
than	
expected	
for	
age.2	
C.	

The	
curtailed	
sleep	
pattern	
is	
present	
most	
days	
for	
at	
least	
three	
months	
.	

D.	

The	
patient	
curtails	
sleep	
time	
by	
such	
measures	
as	
an	
alarm	
clock	
or	
being	
awakened	
by	
another	
person	
and	
generally	
sleeps	
longer	
when	
such	
measures	
are	
not	
used	
,	
such	
as	
on	
weekends	
or	
vacations	
.	

E.	
Extension	
of	
total	
sleep

F.	

The

Notes	
.	

If	
there	
is	
doubt	
about	
the	
accuracy	
of	
personal	
history	
or	
sleep	
logs	
,	
then	
actigraphy	
should	
be	
performed	
,	
preferably	
for	
at	
least	
two	
weeks	
.	
.	

In	
the	
case	
of	
long	
sleepers	
,	
reported	
habitual	
sleep	
periods	
may	
be	
normal	
based	
on	
age	
.	

However	
,	
these	
sleep	
periods	
may	
be	
insufficient	
for	
these	
patients	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
occurs	
when	
an	
individual	
persistently	
fails	
to	
obtain	
the	
amount	
of	
sleep	
required	
to	
maintain	
normal	
levels	
of	
alertness	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

The	
individual	
is	
chronically	
sleep	
deprived	
as	
a	
result	
of	
failure	
to	
achieve	
necessary	
sleep	
time	
due	
to	
reduced	
time	
in	
bed	
.	

There	
is	
a	
U	
-	
shaped	
relationship	
between	
age	
and	
average	
sleep	
time	
,	
with	
the	
minimum	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
individuals	
.	

Examination	
reveals	
unimpaired	
or	
above	
-	
average	
ability	
to	
initiate	
and	
maintain	
sleep	
,	
with	
little	
or	
no	
psychopathology	
.	

Physical	
examination	
reveals	
no	
medical	
explanation	
for	
the	
patient	
’s	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

A	
detailed	
history	
of	
the	
sleep	
pattern	
reveals	
a	
substantial	
dis-	
parity	
between	
the	
need	
for	
sleep	
and	
the	
amount	
actually	
obtained	
.	

The	
significance	
of	
this	
disparity	
often	
goes	
unappreciated	
by	
the	
patient	
.	

Sleep	
time	
that	
is	
markedly	
extended	
on	
weekend	
nights	
or	
during	
holidays	
compared	
to	
weekday	
nights	
is	
also	
suggestive	
of	
this	
disorder	
.	

A	
therapeutic	
trial	
of	
a	
longer	
major	
sleep	
episode	
can	
reverse	
the	
symptoms	
.	

In	
individuals	
with	
physiologic	
sleep	
requirements	
significantly	
in	
excess	
of	
seven	
to	
eight	
hours	
,	
reported	
“	
average	
”	
amounts	
of	
sleep	
(	
e.g.	
,	
seven	
hours	
/	
night	
)	
may	
,	
in	
fact	
,	
be	
insufficient	
.	

Additional	
symptoms	
such	
as	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
and	
hypnagogic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
may	
occur	
.

Features	
Depending	
upon	
chronicity

Secondary	
symptoms	
may	
become	
the	
main	
focus	
of	
the	
patient	
,	
serving	
to	
obscure	
the	
primary	
cause	
of	
the	
difficulties

Insufficient

syndrome	DISEASE
affects	
all

It	
may	
be	
more	
frequent	
in	
adolescence	
,	
when	
sleep	
need	
is	
high	
,	
but	
social	
pressure	
and	
tendency	
to	
delay	
sleep	
often	
lead	
to	
chronic	
restricted	
sleep

Cultural	
factors	
may	
also	
influence

Developmental

Insufficient

is	
a	
common	
problem	
in	
adolescents	
.	

It	
should	
be	
differ-	
entiated

,	
the

Increased

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Symptoms	
are	
due	
to	
normal	
physiological	
and	
psychological	
responses	
to	
sleep	
depri-	
vation	
.	

Sleep	
restriction	
studies	
in	
normal	
volunteers	
have	
shown	
that	
even	
mild	
sleep	
restriction	
(	
for	
example	
,	
six	
hours	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
per	
night	
)	
results	
in	
a	
correspond-	
ing	
decrease	
in	
performance	
and	
increased	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
restriction	
to	
four	
hours	
per	
night	
(	
i.e.	
,	
extension	
of	
wakefulness	
to	
20	
hours	
per	
day	
)	
will	
likely	
lead	
to	
greater	
buildup	
of	
homeostatic	
sleep	
drive	
during	
the	
waking	
hours	
and	
greater	
likelihood	
of	
impaired	
performance	
on	
a	
psychomotor	
vigilance	
task	
.	

The	
effects	
of	
sleep	
depriva-	
tion	
on	
neurobehavioral	
performance	
measures	
may	
vary	
with	
the	
nature	
of	
the	
task	
being	
considered	
.	

In	
some	
long	
sleepers	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
be	
aware	
that	
extending	
sleep	
to	
nine	
or	
more	
hours	
often	
results	
in	
improved	
performance	
.	

The	
diagnosis	
of	
insufficient	
sleep	
syn-	
drome	
may	
be	
especially	
difficult	
to	
make	
in	
subjects	
who	
have	
a	
physiologic	
need	
for	
unusually	
large	
amounts	
of	
sleep	
.

Actigraphy	
combined	
with	
sleep	
diaries	
maintained	
for	
a	
2-

be	
helpful

,	
total

and	
MSLT	
are	
not	
required	
to	
establish	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
.	

Rather	
,	
sleep	
time	
is	
extended	
first	
,	
and	
the	
patient	
is	
reevaluated	
.	

If	
a	
therapeutic	
trial	
with	
a	
longer	
sleep	
episode	
eliminates	
the	
symptoms	
,	
insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
diagnosed	
.	

Polysomnography	
,	
when	
performed	
,	
reveals	
reduced	
sleep	
onset	
latency	
,	
and	
high	
(	
greater	
than	
90	
%	
)	
sleep	
efficiency	
.	

When	
extended	
sleep	
is	
permitted	
,	
prolonged	
sleep	
time	
with	
slow	
wave	
rebound	
may	
be	
seen

Isolated

Normal	
Variants	
Long	
Sleeper	

A	
long	
sleeper	
is	
an	
individual	
who	
consistently	
sleeps	
substantially	
more	
in	
24	
hours	
than	
does	
the	
typical	
person	
of	
his	
or	
her	
age	
group	
.	

For	
adults	
,	
the	
usually	
accepted	
figure	
is	
10	
hours	
or	
more	
,	
but	
many	
epidemiologic	
studies	
have	
used	
sleep	
times	
of	
8–10	
hours	
.	

For	
children	
and	
adolescents	
,	
the	
entity	
should	
be	
considered	
if	
sleep	
time	
is	
more	
than	
two	
hours	
longer	
than	
age	
-	
specific	
norms	
.	

Sleep	
,	
although	
long	
,	
is	
basi-	
cally	
normal	
in	
architecture	
and	
physiology	
.	

Sleep	
efficiency	
and	
timing	
are	
normal	
.	

A	
consistent	
daily	
pattern	
,	
documented	
by	
a	
carefully	
kept	
sleep	
log	
(	
preferably	
con-	
firmed	
by	
actigraphy	
)	
,	
showing	
10	
or	
more	
hours	
of	
sleep	
per	
night	
over	
a	
minimum	
of	
seven	
days	
is	
desirable	
for	
the	
identification	
of	
the	
long	
sleeper	
.	

In	
general	
,	
long	
sleepers	
seek	
medical	
help	
when	
they	
develop	
sleepiness	DISEASE
as	
a	
result	
of	
being	
forced	
to	
curtail	
their	
sleep	
time	
to	
less	
than	
their	
required	
amounts	
.	

Usually	
,	
the	
long	
sleep	
pattern	
began	
in	
childhood	
,	
is	
well	
established	
by	
early	
adolescence	
,	
and	
persists	
throughout	
life	
.	

Many	
long	
sleepers	
,	
because	
of	
occupational	
or	
educational	
demands	
,	
function	
with	
reasonable	
success	
on	
nine	
hours	
of

it

In

Genomewide

favor	
a

Long

presumably	
represent	
the	
extreme	
high	
end	
of	
the	
normal	
sleep

continuum	
.	

Long	
sleepers

have	
normal

in	
which	
case	
the

Amounts	
of

are	
somewhat	
higher

The

,	
no

It	
is	
important	
to

Many

an	
acute

and	
rarely

Nevertheless	
,	
differentiation	
from	
pathologic	
con-	
ditions	
of	
hypersomnolence	DISEASE
may	
be	
difficult	
in	
the	
child

because	
the	
normal

is	
somewhat	
higher	
in	
these	
age	
groups	
than	
in

The	
correct	
determination	
is	
often	
made	
by	
exclusion	
of	
specific	
diagnostic	
features	
associated	
with	
other	
conditions	
and	
by	
the

,	
the	
differentiation	
of	
a	
genuine

be	
difficult

In	
the

sleeping

Circadian	
rhythms	
are	
endogenous	
,	
near-24	
-	
hour	
biological	
rhythms	
that	
exist	
in	
all	
living	
organisms	
.	

The	
internal	
near-24	
-	
hour	
circadian	
clock	
is	
entrained	
or	
synchro-	
nized	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
light	
-	
dark	
cycle	
.	

In	
humans	
,	
the	
endogenous	
period	
of	
the	
circa-	
dian	
oscillation	
is	
genetically	
determined	
and	
typically	
is	
slightly	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

In	
order	
to	
maintain	
entrainment	
,	
the	
endogenous	
rhythm	
must	
be	
reset	
each	
day	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
clock	
time	
.	

For	
optimal	
sleep	
,	
the	
actual	
sleep	
time	
should	
match	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
circadian	
rhythm	
of	
sleep	
and	
wake	
propensity	
.	

Therefore	
,	
a	
recurrent	
or	
chronic	
pattern	
of	
sleep	
and	
wake	
disturbance	
may	
result	
from	
disruption	
of	
the	
internal	
circa-	
dian	
timing	
system	
or	
a	
misalignment	
between	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
individual	
’s	
circadian	
sleep	
-	
wake	
propensity	
and	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
social	
and	
physical	
environments	
(	
e.g.	
,	
sleep	
episodes	
scheduled	
entirely	
or	
in	
part	
during	
a	
phase	
of	
circadian	
alertness	
promotion	
)	
.	

As	
used	
herein	
,	
a	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep	
-	
wake	
disorder	
(	
CRSWD	
)	
is	
defined	
by	
the	
following	
criterion	
:	
The	
disorder	DISEASE
is	
caused	
by	
alterations	
of	
the	
circadian	
time	
-	
keeping	
system	
,	
its	
entrainment	
mechanisms	
,	
or	
a	
misalignment	
of	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
and	
the	
external	
environment	
.	

Most	
CRSWDs	
arise	
when	
a	
substantial	
misalignment	
exists	
between	
the	
internal	
rhythm	
and	
the	
required	
timing	
of	
the	
patient	
’s	
school	
,	
work	
,	
or	
social	
activities	
.	

Therefore	
,	
measurement	
of	
endogenous	
circadian	
timing	
is	
important	
for	
the	
accu-	
rate	
diagnosis	
of	
CRSWDs	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
history	
,	
multiple	
tools	
are	
available	
to	
assess	
sleep	
-	
wake	
patterns	
.	

Sleep	
log	
and	
actigraphy	
are	
essential	
instruments	
in	
the	
evaluation	
of	
CRSWDs	
and	
should	
be	
conducted	
for	
at	
least	
seven	
days	
,	
preferably	
for	
14	
days	
,	
to	
capture	
work	
and	
non	
-	
work	
days	
.	

Circadian

and	
urinary

also	
can	
provide	
important	
diagnostic

Circadian

is	
a	
reflec-	
tion	
of	
an	
individual

Several

be

to

of	
“

”	
or	
“

”	
(	
e.g.	
,	
Munich	
Chronotype

,	
or	
Morningness

Questionnaire	
)	
.	

The	
most	
common	
presenting	
symptoms	
of	
CRSWDs	
are	
difficulty	
initiating	
and	
maintaining	
sleep	
,	
and	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
but	
their	
impact	
extends	
to	
adverse	
health	
outcomes	
,	
impairments	
in	
social	
,	
occupational	
and	
educational	
performance	
,	
and	
safety	
concerns	
.	

Important	
advances	
have	
been	
made	
in	
the	
identification	
of	
clin-	
ical	
CRSWD	
subtypes	
,	
particularly	
in	
the	
area	
of	
pediatrics

However	
,	
the	
challenge	
remains	
to	
develop	
more	
precise	
and	
clinically	
practical	
tools	
to	
improve	
diagnostic	
accuracy	
for	
CRSWDs

Essential	
Features	
Delayed	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
(	
DSWPD	DISEASE
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
habitual	
sleep-	
wake	
timing	
that	
is	
delayed	
,	
usually	
more	
than	
two	
hours	
,	
relative	
to	
conventional	
or	
socially	
acceptable	
timing	
.	

Affected	
individuals	
complain	
of	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
a	
socially	
acceptable	
time	
,	
as	
required	
to	
obtain	
sufficient	
sleep	
duration	
on	
a	
school	
or	
work	
night	
.	

Once	
sleep	
onset	
occurs	
,	
it	
is	
reportedly	
of	
normal	
duration	
.	

These	
individ-	
uals	
also	
experience	
difficulty	
arising	
at	
a	
socially	
acceptable	
wake	
time	
,	
as	
required

prepare	
for	
school	
or

When	
allowed	
to	
follow	
his	
or	
her	
preferred	
schedule	
,	
the	
patient	
’s	
timing	
of	
sleep	
is	
delayed

may	
demonstrate	
excessive	
sleep	DISEASE
inertia	DISEASE
(	
extreme	
difficulty	
awakening	
and

)	
in	
the

as	
a

Individuals	
with	
this

disorder	
is	
a	
subtype	
typically	
composed	
of	
ado-	
lescents	
who	
have	
little	
intrinsic	
motivation	
to	
successfully	
complete	
treatment	
and	
thereby	
resume	
a	
normal	
lifestyle	
(	
regular	
school	
attendance	
,	
developmentally	
appro-	
priate	
peer

,	
etc	
)

(	
e.g.

,	
attention	DISEASE

are	
often	
present	
and	
may	
motivate	
the	
patient	
(	
sometimes

to	
avoid	
a

(	
e.g.	
,

trigger	
the	
onset

Although	
social

International	
Classification

Edition	
has	
chosen	
to	
list	
only	
a	
single	
delayed	
sleep

wake	
phase	
diag-	
nosis	
,	
with	
the	
recognition	
that	
most	
cases	
reflect	
variable	
chronobiologic	
and	
behav-	
ioral	
contributions	
.	

Demographics	
The	
exact	
prevalence	
of	
DSWPD	
in	
the	
general	
population	
is	
unknown	
.	

The	
condition	
is	
more	
common	
among	
adolescents	
and	
young	
adults	
,	
with	
a	
reported	
prevalence	
of	
7	
%	
to	
16	
%	
.	

It	
is	
estimated	
that	
DSWPD	
is	
seen	
in	
approximately	
10	
%	
of	
patients	
pre-	
senting	
in	
sleep	
clinics	
with	
recurrent	
insomnia	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
.	

There	
have	
been	
no	
studies	
assessing	
racial	
/	
ethnic	
differences	
in	
DSWPD	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Most	
individuals	
with	
DSWPD	
are	
evening	
chronotypes	
.	

Many	
adolescents	
experi-	
ence	
a	
biological	
endogenous	
shift	
towards	
later	
bedtimes	
beginning	
around	
puberty	
.	

Genetic	
factors	
such	
as	
polymorphism	
in	
the	
circadian	
clock	
gene	
hPer3	
are	
associated	
with	
DSWPD	
.	

Environmental	
factors	
,	
including	
decreased	
exposure	
to	
light	
during	
the	
phase	
advance	
region	
of	
the	
phase	
response	
curve	
(	
PRC	
)	
(	
i.e.	
,	
in	
the	
morning	
on	
days	
with	
early	
wake	
times	
)	
or	
increased	
exposure	
to	
bright	
light	
during	
the	
phase	
delay	
portion	
of	
the	
PRC	
(	
i.e.	
,	
late	
in	
the	
evening	
)	
may	
exacerbate	
the	
delayed	
circa-	
dian	
phase	
.	

Individuals	
may	
have	
increased	
sensitivity	
in	
the	
phase	
delay	
region	
or	
decreased	
sensitivity	
in	
the	
phase	
advance	
region	
of	
the	
phase	
response	
curve	
to	
light	
.	

Maladjustment	
to	
changes	
in	
work	
and	
social	
schedules	
,	
travel	
across	
time	
zones	
,	
and	
shift	
work	
can	
precipitate	
this	
disorder	
.	

Individuals	
may	
consume	
excessive	
caffeine	CHEMICAL
and	
other	
stimulants	CHEMICAL
,	
which	
may	
further	
delay	
sleep	
onset	
and	
thus	
exacerbate	
the	
delayed	
sleep	
time	
.	

Social	
and	
behavioral	
factors	
play	
an	
important	
role	
in	
the	
development	
and	
mainte-	
nance	
of	
the	
delayed	
sleep	
patterns	
for	
many	
affected	
individuals	
.	

Personal	
,	
social	
,	
and	
occupational	
activities	
that	
continue	
into	
the	
late	
evening	
may	
perpetuate	
and	
exacerbate	
the	
sleep	
phase	
delay	
.	

In	
adolescents	
,	
the	
role	
of	
school	
avoidance	
,	
social	
maladjustment	
,	
and	
family	
dysfunction	
should	
be	
considered	
as	
contributing	
factors	
.	

Individuals

a	
psychiatric	DISEASE

such	
as

A	
positive

has	
been	
reported	
in	
approximately	
40	
%	
of	
individuals	
with	
DSWPD	
.	

In	
one	
pedigree	
,	
DSWPD	
was	
suggested	
to	
segregate	
as	
an	
autosomal

with	
DSWPD	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
A	
delayed	
sleep	
pattern	
typically	
begins	
during	
adolescence	
.	

Onset	
in	
early	
childhood	
is	
also	
described	
,	
especially	
in	
familial	
cases	
;	
the	
onset	
may	
follow	
psychological	
,	
medical	
,	
or	
environmental	
stressors	
.	

Without	
treatment	
,	
DSWPD	DISEASE
is	
a	
chronic	
condition	
that	
may	
last	
into	
late	
life	
.	

However	
,	
with	
increasing	
age	
across	
adulthood	
,	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
may	
advance	
,	
thereby	
decreasing	
the	
propensity	
to	
delayed	
sleep	
phase	
.	

Phototherapy	CHEMICAL
,	
as	
well	
as	
behavioral	
and	
pharmacologic	
treatments	
,	
can	
advance	
the	
timing	
of	
sleep	
hours	
,	
but	
there	
is	
usually	
a	
continual	
tendency	
and	
prefer-	
ence	
for	
delayed	
sleep	
hours	
,	
and	
recurrence	
is	
high	
.	

Use	
of	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
,	
sedatives	
,	
hypnot-	
ics	
,	
or	
stimulants	CHEMICAL
to	
treat	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
sleepiness	DISEASE
during	
normal	
waking	
hours	
may	
lead	
to	
substance	
abuse	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
DSWPD	
may	
be	
encountered	
in	
any	
age	
group	
but	
is	
especially	
prevalent	
among	
ado-	
lescents	
and	
young	
adults	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
clinical	
features	
described	
elsewhere	
,	
DSWPD	
may	
present	
in	
older	
children	
and	
adolescents	
with	
chief	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
truancy	DISEASE
,	
repeated	
school	
absences	
,	
chronic	
tardiness	DISEASE
and/or	
school	
failure	
,	
rather	
than	
sleep	
complaints	
per	
se	
.	

In	
severe	
cases	
,	
school	
attendance	
is	
completely	
curtailed	
and	
the	
patient	
may	
have	
failed	
to	
attend	
school	
regularly	
for	
many	
months	
.	

Extreme	
diffi-	
culty	
in	
morning	
awakening	
,	
requiring	
intensive	
parental	
involvement	
,	
may	
also	
be	
the	
presenting	
concern	
.	

An	
increased	
risk	
of	
motor	
vehicle	
accidents	DISEASE
has	
been	
associated	
with	
delayed	
sleep	
onset	
and	
resultant	
insufficient	
sleep	
in	
adolescents	
;	
thus	
,	
the	
occur-	
rence	
of	
a	
car	
crash	
or	
“	
near	
-	
miss	
”	
incident	
should	
alert	
the	
clinician	
to	
probe	
for	
addi-	
tional	
evidence	
of	
circadian	
pathology	
.	

Adolescents	
may	
also	
present	
primarily	
with	
mood	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
(	
depression	DISEASE
,	
suicidal	DISEASE
ideation	DISEASE
)	
.	

Chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
commonly	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
and	
may	
be	
the	
chief	
presenting	
complaint	DISEASE
in	
adolescents	
with	
DSWPD	DISEASE
as	
a	
result	
of	
repeated	
attempts	
and	
failures	DISEASE
to	
achieve	
sleep	
onset	
at	
their	
desired	
bedtime	
.	

In	
younger	
children	
,	
the	
condition	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
delays	
in	
other	
markers	
of	
circadian	
phase	
,	
including	
the	
typical	
presleep	
surge	
in	
alertness	
referred	
to	
as	
the	
“	
for-	
bidden	
zone	
”	
or	
“	
second	
wind	
phenomenon	
.	
”	

Thus	
,	
especially	
in	
younger	
children	
,	
DSWPD	
may	
present	
primarily	
as	
bedtime	
resistance	
,	
as	
caregivers	
attempt	
to	
establish	
bedtimes	
that	
directly	
conflict	
with	
the	
child	
’s	
circadian	
-	
mediated	
readiness	
for	
sleep	
.	

Several	
pediatric	
populations	
appear	
to	
have	
an	
increased	
vulnerability	
to	
DSWPD	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
disturbances	DISEASE
,	
likely	
of	
multifactorial	
etiology	
.	

These	
include	
children	
with	
attention	DISEASE
deficit	DISEASE
hyperactivity	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
ADHD	DISEASE
)	
and	
autism	DISEASE
spectrum	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
ASD	
)	
.	

Several	
studies	
have	
examined	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
onset	
in	
children	
with	
ADHD	DISEASE
and	
reported	
significant	
delays	
in	
comparison	
with	
typically	
developing	
children	
,	
as	
well	
as	
suc-	
cessful	
treatment	
with	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
.	

Children	
with	
ASD	DISEASE
have	
a	
high	
prevalence	
(	
up	
to	
80	
%	
)	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbances	DISEASE
,	
including	
delayed	
sleep	
onset	
,	
night	
and	
early	
morning	DISEASE
awakenings	DISEASE
,	
and	
irregular	
sleep	
patterns	
,	
at	
least	
some	
of	
which	
appear	
associated	
with	
circadian	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
.	

These	
children	
reportedly	
have	
a	
number	
of	
alterations	
in	
mel-	

atonin	
synthesis	
,	
levels	
,	
amplitude	
,	
and	
patterns	
of	
secretion	
.	

Little	
is	
known	
about	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
the	
clinical	
entity	
of	
DSWPD	
in	
the	
pediat-	
ric	
population	
,	
including	
the	
impact	
of	
various	
treatment	
modalities	
,	
the	
likelihood	
of	
spontaneous	
resolution	
of	
symptoms	
,	
or	
long	
-	
term	
consequences	
.	

There	
is	
increasing	
evidence	
to	
suggest	
that	
the	
evening	
chronotype	
is	
associated	
in	
both	
children	
and	
adolescents	
with	
a	
number	
of	
adverse	
consequences	
,	
including	
decreased	
health	
-	
related	
quality	
of	
life	
,	
higher	
rates	
of	
behavioral	
/	
emotional	
problems	
including	
depression	DISEASE
and	
suicidality	DISEASE
,	
decreased	
sleep	
duration	
and	
increased	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
more	
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
,	
impairments	
in	
academic	
functioning	
,	
and	
increased	
likelihood	
of	
substance	
use	
.	

Thus	
,	
eveningness	DISEASE
may	
confer	
an	
increased	
risk	
for	
physical	
and	
mental	
health	
problems	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
exact	
mechanisms	
responsible	
for	
DSWPD	
are	
unknown	
.	

An	
abnormal	
interac-	
tion	
between	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
and	
the	
sleep	
homeostatic	
process	
that	
regulates	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
may	
play	
an	
essential	
role	
in	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
DSWPD	
.	

Early	
studies	
reported	
an	
altered	
phase	
relationship	
between	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
and	
circadian	
phase	
,	
whereas	
more	
recent	
studies	
have	
failed	
to	
support	
this	
finding	
.	

In	
these	
patients	
,	
sleep	
onset	
,	
sleep	
offset	
,	
and	
phase	
of	
circadian	
markers	
such	
as	
core	
body	
temperature	
and	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
are	
delayed	
relative	
to	
clock	
time	
when	
com-	
pared	
with	
controls	
.	

Although	
this	
condition	
may	
be	
predominantly	
due	
to	
a	
misalign-	
ment	
between	
circadian	
timing	
and	
the	
external	
environment	
,	
alterations	
in	
the	
length	
of	
the	
circadian	
period	
or	
an	
altered	
homeostatic	
process	
(	
indicated	
by	
decreased	
sleep	
propensity	
in	
response	
to	
sleep	
deprivation	
)	
also	
may	
be	
contributing	
factors	
.	

In	
chil-	
dren	
and	
adults	
,	
voluntary	
behaviors	
such	
as	
staying	
awake	
late	
at	
night	
and	
waking	
up	
late	
in	
the	
morning	
or	
afternoon	
may	
result	
in	
an	
abnormal	
relationship	
between	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
and	
the	
sleep	
homeostatic	
process	
that	
regulates	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

Delayed	
bedtimes	
and	
wake	
times	
may	
increase	
exposure	
to	
bright

light	
in	
the	
late

(	
a	
delay	
signal	
for	
the	
circadian	
clock	
)	
and	
decrease	
expo-	
sure	
to	
light	
in	
the	
early	
morning	
(	
an

signal	
for	
the	
circadian	
clock	
)	
,	
thereby	
promoting	
and	
perpetuating	
the	
delay	
in	
the	
circadian	
sleep	
phase	
.	

Given	
a	
sufficient	
discrepancy	
between	
early	
and	
late	
wake	
times	
,	
early	
wake	
times	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
bright	
light	
exposure	
during	
the	
maximal	
phase	
delay	
region	
,	
perpetuating	
the	
cir-	
cadian	
phase	
delay	
and	
the	
disorder	
.	

Individuals	
may	
have	
alterations	
in	
sensitivity	
to	
the	
phase	
shifting	
effects	
of	
light	
.	

For	
example	
,	
partial	
sleep	
deprivation	
encountered	
with	
this	
disorder	
can	
also	
attenuate	
the	
ability	
to	
phase	
-	
advance	
the	
circadian	
system	
,	
further	
perpetuating	
the	
delayed	
circadian	
phase	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Recordings	
of	
sleep	
logs	
and	
actigraphy	
over	
an	
interval	
of	
at	
least	
seven	
(	
and	
pref-	
erably	
fourteen	
)	
consecutive	
days	
demonstrate	
delayed	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sleep	
offset	
(	
typically	
greater	
than	
two	
hours	
)	
relative	
to	
socially	
acceptable	
times	
.	

Though	
clock	
times	
may	
be	
culture	
dependent	
,	
for	
many	
affected	
individuals	
sleep	
onset	
is	
typi-	
cally	
delayed	
until	
1:00	
a.m.	
to	
6:00	
a.m.	
,	
(	
though	
may	
be	
earlier	
based	
on	
age	
and	
developmental	
status	
)	
,	
and	
wake	
time	
occurs	
in	
the	
late	
morning	
or	
afternoon	
.	

Daily	
demands	
and	
schedules	
may	
result	
in	
an	
earlier	
than	
desired	
wake	
-	
up	
time	
during	
work	
or	
school	
days	
,	
but	
a	
delay	
in	
bedtime	
and	
wake	
-	
up	
time	
is	
almost	
always	
seen	
during	
free	
days	
and	
vacation	
.	

Polysomnography	
(	
though	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
nor	
required	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
)	
,	
when	
performed	
at	
preferred	
(	
delayed	
)	
sleep	
times	
,	
is	
essentially	
normal	
for	
age	
.	

If	
a	
conventional	
bedtime	
and	
wake	
-	
up	
time	
are	
enforced	
,	
however	
,	
polysomnographic	
recording	
may	
show	
prolonged

Several

the	
degree	
of	
eveningness	DISEASE
or

(	
e.g.	
,	
“

”	
“	
Munich

”	
)	
.	

Individuals	
with	
DSWPD	DISEASE
,	
typ-

score	
high	
as	
evening

though	
normal

The

of	
polysomnography	
and	
other	
diagnostic	
tools	
in	
younger	
age	
groups	
are	
similar	
to	
those	
seen	
in

Actigraphy	
and/or	
sleep	
logs	
are	
useful	
in	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
DSWPD	
in	
the	
pediatric	
population	
.	

Several	
validated	
instruments	
are	
available	
for	
assessing	
phase	
preference	
in	
the	
pediatric	
and	
adolescent	
pop-	
ulations	
.	

These	
include	
the	
Children

(

)	
(

,	
the

)	
,	
and	
the	
Morningness	
-	
Eveningness	
Questionnaire	
for	
Children	
and	
Adolescents	
.	

These	
surveys	
have	
been	
used	
to	
assess	
chronotype	
in	
the	
pediatric	
population	
and	
may	
be	
useful	
in	
clinical	
settings	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Delayed	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
“	
normal	
”	
sleep	
pat-	
terns	
,	
particularly	
in	
adolescents	
and	
young	
adults	
who	
maintain	
delayed	
schedules	
regularly	
or	
intermittently	
,	
without	
distress	DISEASE
or	
impaired	
functioning	
.	

DSWPD	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
difficulty	
initiating	
sleep	
,	
including	
chronic	
insom-	
nia	
disorder	
.	

In	
DSWPD	
,	
sleep	
initiation	
and	
maintenance	
are	
improved	
when	
the	
patient	
is	
allowed	
to	
sleep	
on	
the	
preferred	
schedule	
.	

When	
individuals	
with	
DSWPD	
must	
arise	
before	
the	
desired	
wake	
time	
,	
excessive	
sleep	DISEASE
inertia	DISEASE
and	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
be	
evident	
.	

Other	
forms	
of	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
from	
which	
this	
must	
be	
distinguished	
,	
do	
not	
generally	
exhibit	
the	
pronounced	
circadian	
pattern	
and	
do	
not	
abate	
with	
alterations	
in	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedule	
.	

The	
development	
of	
DSWPD	
may	
be	
influenced	
by	
alterations	
in	
circadian	
physiology	
as	
well	
as	
behavioral	
factors	
.	

Inadequate	
sleep	
hygiene	
and	
insufficient	
sleep	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
must	
also	
be	
considered	
in	
the	
differential	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
is	
limited	
knowledge	
of	
the	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
DSWPD	
.	

Recent	
evidence	
suggests	
that	
alteration	
in	
the	
homeostatic	
regulation	
of	
sleep	
and	
alertness	
may	
play	
an	
important	
role	
.	

The	
intrinsic	
circadian	
period	
may	
be	
abnormally	
long	
.	

Recent	
advances	
in	
the	
understanding	
of	
the	
molecular	
basis	
for	
the	
generation	
and	
entrainment	
of	
circadian	
rhythms	
,	
together	
with	
the	
identification	
of	
a	
familial	
form	
of	
DSWPD	
,	
will	
lead	
to	
improved	
understanding	
of	
the	
mechanisms	
responsible	
for	
this	
condition	
,	
as	
well	
as	
targeted	
,	
evidence

are	
useful	
tools	
to	
assess	
the	
chronotype	
of	
eveningness	DISEASE
and	
morningness	DISEASE
.	

Individuals	
with	
advanced	
sleep

(	
typically	
greater	
than	
two	
hours	
)

as	
DLMO	DISEASE
or

Essential	
Features	
Advanced	
sleep	
-	
wake	
phase	
disorder	
(	
ASWPD	DISEASE
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
stable	
advance	
(	
earlier	
timing	
)	
of	
the	
major	
sleep	
episode	
,	
such	
that	
habitual	
sleep	
onset	
and	
offset	
occur	
typically	
two	
or	
more	
hours	
prior	
to	
required	
or	
desired	
times	
.	

Affected	
individ-	
uals	
complain	
of	
early	
morning	
or	
maintenance	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
excessive	
evening	
sleep-	
iness	
.	

When	
affected	
individuals	
are	
allowed	
to	
maintain	
an	
advanced	
schedule	
,	
sleep	
quality	
and	
quantity	
are	
improved	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Individuals	
with	
ASWPD	
may	
experience	
chronic	
partial	
sleep	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
due	
to	
early	
morning	
and	
maintenance	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
particularly	
if	
sleep	
is	
resisted	
during	
early	
evening	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Familial	
patterns	
are	
discussed	
below	
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
of	
ASWPD	
in	
the	
general	
population	
is	
unknown	
.	

In	
one	
large	
survey	
study	
involving	
middle	
-	
aged	
adults	
(	
40	
-	
64	
years	
)	
,	
the	
population	
prevalence	
was	
esti-	
mated	
at	
1	
%	
,	
although	
it	
is	
unclear	
what	
proportion	
of	
these	
subjects	
would	
deem	
their	
schedule	
to	
be	
significantly	
troublesome	
so	
as	
to	
warrant	
clinical	
attention	
.	

Until	
the	
identification	
of	
familial	
cohorts	
(	
see	
below	
)	
,	
only	
four	
cases	
were	
described	
in	
the	
lit-	
erature	
.	

There	
is	
no	
known	
sex	
difference

age	
appears	
to	
be	
a	
risk	
factor	
.	

Among	
a	
cohort	
aged	
20	
to	
59	
years	
,	
older	
age	
was	
associated	
with	
increased	
morningness	DISEASE
,	
which	
was	
determined	
to	
be	
a	
sig-	
nificant	
mediator	
of	
numerous	
age	
-	
sleep	
relationships	
.	

A	
patient	
’s	
ability	
to	
sleep	
at	
an	
abnormal	
circadian	
phase	
(	
phase	
tolerance	
)	
also	
impacts	
the	
degree	
to	
which	
adverse	
symptoms	
are	
experienced	
,	
and	
this	
adaptability	
varies	
among	
individuals	
.	

Conflicting	
results	
have	
been	
obtained	
with	
respect	
to	
the	
relationship	
between	
age	
and	
phase	
tolerance	
,	
with	
some	
suggesting	
that	
age	
decreases	
phase	
tolerance	
,	
and	
others	
suggesting	
that	
age	
may	
actually	
be	
protective	
.	

Methodological	
differences	
preclude	
direct	
comparisons	
of	
the	
investigations	
,	
as	
do	
wide	
variations	
in	
the	
age	
groups	
studied	
.	

Genetic	
factors	
also	
can	
influence	
the	
development	
of	
the	
condition	
,	
as	
has	
been	
definitively	
demonstrated	
among	
select	
familial	
cohorts	
(	
see	
Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
section	
)	
.	

Environmental	
influences	
may	
precipitate	
,	
maintain	
,	
or	
exacerbate	
the	
advanced	
circadian	
phase	
,	
but	
this	
has	
not	
been	
proven	
.	

ASWPD	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
in	
children	
with	
neurodevelopmental	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

In	
particular	
,	
studies	
in	
children	
with	
autism	DISEASE
spectrum	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
and	
Smith	
-	
Magenis	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
have	
shown	
profound	
alterations	
in	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
secretion	
profiles	
,	
which	
may	
manifest	
as	
a	
phase	
advance	
with	
very	
early	
morning	
waking	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Various	
groups	
have	
described	
kindreds	
with	
familial	
ASWPD	
.	

These	
cases	
may	
be	
characterized	
by	
an	
earlier	
age	
of	
onset	
.	

It	
is	
not	
clear	
whether	
the	
familial	
or	
non-	
familial	
variety	
of	
the	
condition	
is	
more	
common	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Repetitive	
attempts	
to	
resume	
sleep	
with	
awakenings	
may	
result	
in	
the	
development	
of	
a	
comorbid	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Individuals	
may	
use	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
,	
other	
sedatives	
,	
and/or	
stimulants	CHEMICAL
to	
alleviate	
symptoms	
,	
potentially	
exacerbating	
the	
underlying	
sleep/	
wake	
disorder	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
of	
children	
with	
neurodevelopmental	DISEASE
disor-	DISEASE
ders	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
ASWPD	DISEASE
may	
be	
particularly	
profound	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
ASWPD	
is	
most	
frequently	
encountered	
among	
older	
age	
groups	
.	

An	
early	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
ASWPD	
should	
prompt	
further	
probing	
for	
a	
familial	
pattern	
.	

Caregivers	
may	
report	
that	
a	
child	
wakes	
“	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
morning	
,	
which	
is	
disruptive	
to	
the	
house-	
hold	
routine	
and	
may	
curtail	
parental	
sleep	
.	

This	
is	
particularly	
true	
for	
younger	
chil-	
dren	
,	
who	
may	
require	
adult	
supervision	
once	
they	
are	
awake	
.	

However	
,	
this	
complaint	
regarding	
the	
waking	
pattern	
is	
often	
more	
related	
to	
unrealistic	
caregiver	
expecta-	
tions	
regarding	
an	
“	
appropriate	
”	
wake	
time	
for	
a	
young	
child	
and/or	
a	
developmentally	
inappropriate	
early	
bedtime	
resulting	
in	
prolonged	
time	
in	
bed	
,	
rather	
than	
to	
a	
true	
advance	
in	
sleep	
onset	
and	
offset	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
children	
are	
motivated	
to	
wake	
up	
earlier	
than	
desired	
because	
they	
are	
reinforced	
for	
this	
behavior	
by	
parental	
attention	
or	
the	
opportunity	
to	
watch	
television	
or	
utilize	
other	
media	
upon	
waking	
.	

The	
com-	
plaint	
that	
a	
child	
“	
falls	
asleep	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
evening	
,	
especially	
in	
adolescence	
,	
is	
rare	
and	
should	
raise	
concerns	
regarding	
the	
possibility	
of	
chronically	
insufficient	
sleep	
and/or	
a	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
resulting	
in	
increased	
sleep	
needs	
.	

The	
rarity	
of	
observa-	
tions	
of	
advanced	
sleep	
onset	
and	
offset	
times	
among	
young	
children	
may	
also	
be	
due	
in	
part	
to	
societal	
expectations	
of	
earlier	
bed	
and	
wake	
times	
for	
this	
age	
group	
;	
thus	
,	
a	
misalignment	
with	
circadian	
preference	
is	
less	
likely	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Possible	
etiologies	
include	
:	
(	
1	
)	
an	
alteration	
in	
the	
ability	
of	
the	
circadian	
clock	
to	
phase	
delay	
;	
(	
2	
)	
a	
dominant	
phase	
advance	
region	
of	
the	
light	
phase	
response	
curve	
to	
entraining	
agents	
;	
(	
3	
)	
altered	
strength	
of	
entraining	
agents	
,	
such	
as	
light	
exposure	
at	
the	
appropriate	
circadian	
time	
(	
voluntarily	
or	
involuntarily	
induced	
)	
;	
or	
(	
4	
)	
a	
shortened	
endogenous	
circadian	
period	
of	
the	
pacemaker	
.	

Among	
these	
proposed	
mechanisms	
,	
only	
the	
latter	
has	
been	
definitively	
demonstrated	
among	
select	
familial	
ASWPD	
sub-	
jects	
.	

Genetic	
analyses	
revealed	
a	
missense	
mutation	
in	
a	
casein	
kinase	
(	
CK1ε	
)	
binding	
region	
of	
a	
Period	
gene	
(	
hPer2	
)	
,	
culminating	
in	
hypophosphorylation	
by	
CK1ε	
in	
vitro	
.	

Hypophosphorylation	
of	
the	
Period	
protein	
results	
in	
promotion	
of	
its	
transcription	
and	
,	
ultimately	
,	
a	
decrease	
in	
the	
period	
length	
of	
the	
clock	
.	

However	
,	
genetic	
het-	
erogeneity	
is	
apparent	
within	
familial	
ASWPD	
,	
as	
demonstrated	
by	
the	
fact	
that	
other	
cohorts	
from	
this	
same	
study	
and	
another	
study	
did	
not	
reveal	
mutations	
in	
hPer2	
.	

A	
separate	
report	
of	
a	
Japanese	
familial	
ASWPD	
cohort	
described	
a	
missense	
mutation	
in	
a	
different	
casein	
kinase	
gene	
(	
CKIδ	
)	
,	
which	
also	
resulted	
in	
decreased	
enzymatic	
activity	
in	
vitro	
.	

Yet	
another	
group	
described	
associations	
between	
hPer1	
and	
hPer2	
polymorphisms	
and	
extreme	
morningness	
circadian	
preferences	
(	
questionnaire	
-	
based	
)	
,	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
discrete	
ASWPD	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Among	
patients	
with	
familial	
ASWPD	
,	
laboratory	
measures	
to	
determine	
the	
phase	
of	
circadian	
rhythms	
reliably	
show	
the	
expected	
phase	
advance	
in	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
nadir	
of	
the	
temperature	
rhythm	
and	
the	
dim	
light	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
onset	
,	
in	
comparison	
with	
unaf-	
fected	
controls	
.	

Among	
those	
with	
nonfamilial	
ASWPD	
,	
a	
wider	
range	
of	
timing	
of	
circadian	
markers	
is	
found	
,	
with	
some	
values	
approaching	
those	
of	
unaffected	
controls	
.	

Polysomnography	
(	
though	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
nor	
required	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
)	
,	
when	
performed	
at	
preferred	
(	
advanced	
)	
sleep	
times	
,	
is	
essentially	
normal	
for	
age	
.

a	
conventional

time	
is

,	
however	
,	
polysomnographic	
recording	
may	
show	
short	
sleep	
latency	
and	
early	
awakening	
with	
curtailment	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
ASWPD	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
“	
normal	
”	
sleep	
patterns	
,	
particularly	
among	
the	
elderly	
or	
very	
young	
,	
who	
often	
maintain	
advanced	
schedules	
without	
distress	DISEASE
or	
impaired	
functioning	
.	

ASWPD	
must	
also	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
early	
awakening	
,	
including	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Poor	
sleep	
hygiene	
practices	
,	
partic-	
ularly	
evening	
napping	DISEASE
among	
the	
elderly	
,	
and	
irregularity	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedule	
should	
also	
be	
considered	
.	

The	
possibility	
of	
a	
“	
free	
-	
running	
”	
(	
nonentrained	
)	
circadian	
rhythm	
also	
merits	
consideration	
,	
but	
patients	
with	
this	
condition	
are	
most	
commonly	
blind	
and	
report	
only	
periodic	
complaints	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
depending	
on	
the	
relative	
rela-	
tionship	
between	
the	
internal	
rhythm	
and	
that	
of	
the	
light	
/	
dark	
cycle	
.	

Major	
depressive	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
a	
common	
cause	
of	
early	
awakening	
that	
must	
be	
considered	
.	

These	
patients	
do	
not	
typically	
manifest	
the	
early	
evening	
sleepiness	DISEASE
that	
is	
characteristic	
of	
ASWPD	
.	

As	
with	
any	
sleep	
disturbances	
that	
persists	
over	
time	
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
can	
develop	
second-	
arily	
.	

The	
Horne	
-	
Östberg	
questionnaire	
(	
or	
other	
chronotype	
questionnaire	
)	
may	
assist	
in	
determining	
the	
contribution	
of	
a	
morningness	
circadian	
preference	
to	
the	
presenting	
sleep	
/	
wake	
complaint	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
more	
than	
one	
contributing	
variable	
seems	
to	
be	
the	
norm	
,	
and	
each	
entity	
needs	
to	
be	
treated	
accordingly	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

The	
existing	
literature	
suggests	
that	
clinicians	
are	
unlikely	
to	
encounter	
patients	
with	
stringently	
defined	
ASWPD	
.	

Until	
the	
identification	
of	
familial	
cohorts	
,	
only	
four	
cases	
were	
described	
.	

Various	
treatment	
trials	
also	
support	
this	
contention	
with	
demon-	CHEMICAL
stration	
of	
objectively	
conventional	
sleep	
and	
wake	
times	
despite	
study	
entry	
based	
on	
subjective	
reports	
of	
advanced	
sleep	
phase	
.	

Select	
studies	
of	
patients	
with	
sole	
complaints	
of	
maintenance	
insomnia	DISEASE
/	
early	
-	
morning	
awakenings	
have	
demonstrated	
marked	
advances	
(	
earlier	
timing	
)	
of	
physiologically	
measured	
circadian	
rhythms	
.	

The	
absence	
of	
the	
early	
evening	
sleepiness	DISEASE
complaint	DISEASE
may	
be	
due	
to	
the	
fact	
that	
the	
timing	
of	
sleep	
onset	
can	
be	
more	
readily	
modified	
than	
wake	
time	
,	
and	
is	
likely	
to	
be	
more	
actively	
resisted	
due	
to	
its	
propensity	
to	
conflict	
with	
social	
or	
family	
obligations	
.	

Alternatively	
,	
evening	
sleep	
that	
occurs	
prior	
to	
entering	
the	
bed	
/	
bedroom	
may	
not	
be	
reported	
as	
such	
.	

If	
it	
is	
definitively	
demonstrated	
that	
the	
evening	
sleepiness	DISEASE
complaint	DISEASE
is	
not	
present	
or	
is	
not	
prominent	
,	
the	
term	
advance	
-	
related	
sleep	
complaints	
may	
be	
used	
in	
lieu	
of	
ASWPD	
.	

If	
this	
broader	
term	
is	
used	
,	
the	
condition	
is	
observed	
more	
commonly	
(	
~7	
%	
of	
respondents	
in	
a	
study	
of	
individuals	
aged	
40	
-	
64	
years	
)	
.	

There	
is	
limited	
knowledge	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
ASWPD	
(	
or	
advance	
-	
related	
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
)	
beyond	
those	
associated	
with	
select	
cases	
of	
familial	
ASWPD	
.	

Increased	
use	
of	
physiologic	
circadian	
assessments	
will	
require	
the	
development	
of	
normative	
values	
to	
guide	
practitioners	
.	

Knowledge	
gaps	
are	
even	
more	
prominent	
within	
pediat-	
ric	
and	
adolescent	
populations	
.

)	
is	
characterized	
by	
lack

sleep	
and	
wake	
.	

The	
chronic

is	
temporally	
disorganized

being	
typi-	
cally	
less

report	
frequent

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Older	
adults	
with	
Alzheimer	DISEASE

who	
experience	
sundowning	
may	
represent	
a	
clin-	
ical	
subtype	
with	
more	
severe	
sleep	
fragmentation	
and	
lower	
circadian

Neurodegenerative	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
Alzheimer	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
Parkinson	DISEASE

,	
and	
Huntington	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
increase	
the	
risk	
for	
ISWRD	
.	

Children	
with	
developmental	
disor-

also	
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
ISWRD

of	
exposure	
to	
external	
synchronizing	
agents	
such	
as	
light	
,

and	
social	
schedules	
may	
be	
predisposing	
as	
well	
as	
precipitating	
factors	
involved	
in	
the	
development	
of	
ISWRD

Onset

occur	
at	
any	
age	
.	

Little	
is	
known	
regarding	
the	
course	
and	
complications	
of	
ISWRD	
in	
adults	
.	

Due	
to	
the	
multiple	
awakenings	
and	
,	
in	
the	
elderly	
,	
nocturnal	
wandering	
,	
falls	
can	
be	
an	
indirect	
complication	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
patient	
’s	
sleep	
-	
wake	
dysfunction	
,	
the	
caregiver	
’s	
sleep	
is	
often	
disrupted	
.	

The	
sleep	
and	
wake	
disruption	
associated	
with	
ISWRD	
is	
a	
common	
cause	
of	
institutionalization	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Caregivers	
may	
report	
that	
a	
child	
with	
ISWRD	
has	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
the	
desired	
bedtime	
or	
“	
falls	
asleep	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
evening	
,	
wakes	
“	
too	
early	
”	
or	
has	
dif-	
ficulty	
waking	
in	
the	
morning	
,	
and/or	
exhibits	
developmentally	
inappropriate	DISEASE
napping	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
during	
the	
day	
.	

Parents	
may	
complain	
that	
their	
child	
sleeps	
too	
much	
or	
too	
little	
or	
at	
inappropriate	
times	
.	

Attempts	
to	
keep	
the	
child	
awake	
during	
the	
day	
,	
especially	
during	
sedentary	
activities	
,	
are	
often	
unsuccessful	
.	

The	
key	
characteristics	
that	
distinguish	
ISWRD	
from	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
or	
circadian	
sleep	
wake	
disor-	
ders	
are	
the	
lack	
of	
prolonged	
consolidated	
sleep	
periods	
,	
the	
often	
seemingly	
random	
distribution	
in	
sleep	
periods	
across	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
,	
and	
the	
marked	
day	
-	
to	
-	
day	
and	
week	
-	
to	
-	
week	
variability	
with	
little	
in	
the	
way	
of	
a	
clearly	
predictable	
major	
sleep-	
wake	
pattern	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
’	
sleep	
and	
daytime	
functioning	
is	
likely	
to	
be	
particularly	
profound	
.	

There	
may	
be	
phenotypes	
of	
ISWRD	
in	
children	
,	
with	
differences	
regarding	
symptom	
presentation	
and	
severity	
and	
chronicity	
that	
are	
related	
to	
the	
underlying	
condition	
.

For	
example	
,	
it	
is	
possible	
that	
children	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
neurologic	DISEASE
conditions	DISEASE
such	DISEASE
as	DISEASE
autism	DISEASE
or	
chromosomal	
syndromes	
characterized	
by	
developmental	
delays	
may	
have	
a	
more	
intractable	
and	
treatment	
resistant	
pattern	
compared	
with	
children	
with	
more	
self	
-	
limited	
conditions	
(	
e.g.	
,	
postconcussion	DISEASE
)	
.	

Although	
ISWRD	
appears	
to	
be	
rare	
in	
typically	
developing	
children	
,	
it	
may	
be	
envi-	
ronmentally	
or	
behaviorally	
induced	
.	

This	
may	
be	
seen	
in	
children	
with	
irregular	
or	
fragmented	
sleep	
and	
wake	
schedules	
because	
of	
a	
chaotic	
household	
.	

Children	
with	
developmental	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
ISWRD	
.	

For	
example	
,	
children	
with	
autism	DISEASE
,	
Asperger	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
or	
pervasive	DISEASE
developmental	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
not	
otherwise	
spec-	
ified	
often	
have	
highly	
irregular	
sleep	
patterns	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
these	
children	
often	
have	
circadian	
rhythm	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
which	
are	
both	
more	
severe	
and	
chronic	
and	
they	
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
for	
relapse	
.	

Both	
ISWRD	
and	
non-24	
-	
hour	
sleep	
-	
wake	
rhythm	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
are	
also	
common	
in	
Angelman	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
a	
neurodevelopmental	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
associated	
with	
an	
abnormality	
of	
chromosome	
15q11	
-	
q13	
,	
and	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
children	
with	
Williams	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
a	
neurodevelopmental	DISEASE
genetic	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
characterized	
by	
physical	
abnormalities	
and	
a	
dis-	
tinctive	
cognitive	
profile	
with	
intellectual	DISEASE
disabilities	DISEASE
and	
learning	
difficulties	
.	

Studies	
in	
children	
and	
adults	
with	
autism	DISEASE
spectrum	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
and	
in	
children	
with	
Smith	
-	
Magenis	CHEMICAL
syndrome	
have	
shown	
profound	
alterations	
in	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
secretion	
profiles	
.	

Smith-	

Magenis	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
a	
developmental	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
caused	
by	
an	
abnormality	
in	
the	
short	
(	
p	
)	
arm	
of	
chromosome	
17	
.	

It	
is	
characterized	
by	
mild	
to	
moderate	
intellectual	
disabil-	
ity	
,	
distinctive	
facial	
features	
,	
sleep	
disturbances	
,	
and	
behavioral	
problems	
.	

Decreased	
concentrations	
of	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
and	
its	
metabolites	
and	
daytime	
elevation	
and	
abnormal	
rhythm	
/	
decreased	
amplitude	
of	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
secretion	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
these	
popu-	
lations	
.	

These	
findings	
may	
be	
due	
to	
polymorphisms	
in	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
enzymes	
synthesis	
or	
variants	
in	
genes	
coding	
for	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
receptors	
.	

Other	
postulated	
mechanisms	
for	
circadian	
rhythm	
disturbances	
,	
particularly	
ISWRD	
,	
in	
these	
populations	
include	
clock	
gene	
polymorphisms	
and	
decreased	
levels	
of	
entrainment	
by	
social	
/	
environmental	
cues	
.	

There	
may	
also	
be	
medical	
conditions	
that	
predispose	
typically	
developing	
children	
and	
adolescents	
to	
ISWRD	
.	

These	
include	
traumatic	DISEASE
brain	DISEASE
injury	DISEASE
and	
chronic	
fatigue	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
.	

Brain

survivors	
,	
especially	
patients	
who	
have	
experienced	
disrup-	
tion	
in	
the	
hypothalamic

pituitary	
axis	
,	
may	
have	
an	
increased	
prevalence	
of	
circadian	
rhythm	
disorders	
,	
including	
ISWRD	
.	

There	
is	
very	
little	
literature	
on	
ISWRD	
in	
the	
pediatric	
population	
;	
prevalence	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
racial	
/	
ethnic	
differences	
are	
unknown	
.	

Little	
is	
known	
about	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
the	
clinical	
entity	
of	
ISWRD	
in	
the	
pediatric	
population	
,	
including	
the	
impact	
of	
various	
treatment	
modalities	
,	
the	
likelihood	
of	
spontaneous	
resolution	
of	
symptoms	
,	
or	
long	
-	
term	
consequences	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
of	
children	
with	
neurodevelopmen-	
tal	
disorders	
and	
ISWRD	
may	
be	
particularly	
profound	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
ISWRD	
increases	
with	
advancing	
age	
,	
but	
it	
is	
likely	
that	
age	
-	
re-	
lated	
increase	
in	
neurodegenerative	
disorders	
,	
rather	
than	
aging	
per	
se	
,	
explains	
this	
relationship	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
etiology	
of	
ISWRD	
is	
likely	
multifactorial	
.	

Anatomic	
or	
functional	
abnormal-	
ities	
of	
the	
circadian	
clock	
can	
result	
in	
an	
arrhythmic	
pattern	
of	
rest	
and	
activity	
.	

Decreased	
exposure	
to	
environmental	
-	
entraining	
agents	
,	
such	
as	
light	
and	
structured	
physical	
and	
social	
activities	
(	
common	
in	
institutionalized	
elderly	
,	
and	
children	
with	
developmental	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
)	
,	
also	
can	
contribute	
to	
the	
development	
of	
an	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
.	

Objective	
Findings	

In	
addition	
to	
a	
careful	
sleep	
history	
,	
sleep	
log	
and	
actigraphy	
monitoring	
show	
the	
expected	
lack	
of	
a	
clearly	
defined	
circadian	
rhythm	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
,	
which	
,	
instead	
,	
is	
characterized	
by	
multiple	
irregular	
sleep	
and	
wake	
bouts	
throughout	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
period	
.	

The	
use	
of	
sleep	
log	
and	
actigraphy	
is	
indicated	
for	
the	
identification	
of	
irregular	
sleep	
wake	
rhythm	
.	

The	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
is	
defined	
as	
having	
multiple	
sleep	
bouts	
(	
typically	
2–4	
hours	
)	
during	
a	
24	
-	
hour	
period	
.	

The	
pattern	
may	
vary	
from	
day	
to	
day	
,	
thus	
monitoring	
for	
at	
least	
seven	
days	
and	
preferably	
14	
days	
may	
be	
needed	
to	
differentiate	
the	
irregular	
pattern	
from	
other	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep-	
wake	
disorders	
.	

Polysomnography	
is	
not	
required	
to	
establish	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

Polysomnography	
may	
be	
useful	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
other	
comorbid	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Monitoring	
of	
other	
circa-	
dian	
rhythms	
,	
such	
as	
core	
body	
temperature	
and	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
for	
at	
least	
24	
hours	
,	
may	
also	
show	
a	
loss	
of	
clear	
circadian	
rhythmicity	
or	
a	
low	
amplitude	
rhythm	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Poor	
sleep	
hygiene	
and	
voluntary	
maintenance	
of	
irregular	
sleep	
schedules	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
.	

Individuals	
with	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
rhythms	
may	
present	
with	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Careful	
analysis	
of	
sleep	
logs	
or	
actigraphy	
will	
demonstrate	
multiple	
irregular	
periods	
of	
sleep	
throughout	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
.

Unresolved	
Issues

Further	
Directions	

There	
is	
limited	
knowledge	
of	
the	
pathophysiology

into	
the	
relative	
contribution	
of	
alterations	
in	
environmental	
synchronizing	
agents	
,	
such	
as

versus	
a	
dysfunction	
of	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
clock	
in	
the	
development	
of	
irregular	
sleep

patterns	
will	
lead	
to	
improved	
understanding	
of	
this	
condition

Notes

Patients	
may	
present	
with	
a	
progressively	
delaying	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
and	
intermittent	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Individual	
symptoms	
will	
depend	
on	
when	
an	
individual	
tries	
to	
sleep	
in	
relation	
to	
the	
circadian	
rhythm	
of	
sleep	
-	
wake	
propensity	
.	

The	
magnitude	
of	
the	
daily	
delay	
will	
depend	
on	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
period	
,	
and	
may	
range	
from	
less	
than	
30	
minutes	
(	
when	
the	
period	
is	
close	
to	
24	
hours	
)	
to	
more	
than	
an	
hour	
(	
when	
the	
period	
is	
longer	
than	
25	
hours	
)	
.	
.	

The	
symptomatic	
episode	
will	
typically	
begin	
with	
a	
gradual	
increase	
in	
sleep	
latency	
and	
delayed	
sleep	
onset	
.	

As	
the	
sleep	
propensity	
rhythm	
shifts	
into	
the	
daytime	
,	
patients	
will	
have	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
night	
and	
staying	
awake	
during	
the	
day	
.	

As	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
propensity	
rhythm	
drifts	
further	
,	
patients	
will	
eventually	
complain	
of	
late	
afternoon	
and	
evening	
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
naps	
as	
well	
as	
an	
early	
sleep

disorder	
(	
N24SWD	
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
symptoms	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
or	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
that	
occur	
because	
the	
intrinsic	
circadian	
pace-	
maker	
is	
not	
entrained	
to	
a	
24

hour	
light

The

hour	
period	
can	
be	
shorter	
or	
,	
more	
typically	
,	
longer	
than	
24

Because	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
is	
not	
aligned	
to	
the	
external	
24

environment	
,	
symptoms	
will	
depend	
on	
when	
an

tries	
to	
sleep	
in

to	
the	
circadian

Individuals

can	
be

As	
the

continues	
to	
drift	
so	
that	
maximal

is	
now	
in

individuals	
will	
have	
trouble

Associated	
Features	
Most	
individuals	
with	
nonentrained	
circadian	
rhythms	
are	
totally	
blind	
,	
and	
the	
failure	
to	
entrain	
circadian	
rhythms	
is	
related	
to	
the	
lack	
of	
photic	
input	
to	
the	
cir-	
cadian	
pacemaker	
.	

A	
small	
proportion	
of	
totally	
blind	
people	
may	
retain	
functional	
circadian	
photoreception	
and	
entrained	
rhythms	
if	
their	
blindness	DISEASE
is	
due	
exclusively	
to	
an	
outer	
retina	DISEASE

Some	
blind	
people	
may	
also	
be	
able	
to	
entrain	
to	
nonphotic	
cues	
(	
e.g.	
,	
the	
timing	
of	
physical	
activity	
)	
,	
producing	
entrainment	
at	
an	
adverse	
phase	
in	
some	
cases	
.	

In	
sighted	
people	
,	
social	
and	
behavioral	
factors	
also	
play	
an	
important	
role	
in	
the	
development	
and	
maintenance	
of	
the	
disorder	
,	
as	
there	
is	
an	
increased	
incidence	
of	
psychiatric	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Occasionally	
,	
the	
disorder	
is	
associated	
with	
developmental	
intellectual	DISEASE
disability	DISEASE
or	
dementia	DISEASE
.	

In	
sighted	
individuals	
,	
there	
is	
often	
a	
history	
of	
delayed	
sleep	
phase	
,	
and	
decreased	
exposure	
to	
light	
and	
structured	
social	
and	
phys-	
ical	
activity	
.	

Some	
sighted	
individuals	
with	
N24SWD	
also	
demonstrate	
increased	
sleep	
duration	
.	

Demographics	
It	
is	
thought	
that	
over	
half	
of	
totally	
blind	
individuals	
have	
non-24

;	
50

Predisposing

Precipitating	
Factors	
Total

is	
the	
most	
common

condition	
.	

In	
sighted	
people	
,	
the

can	
be	
induced	
by	
certain	
environmental	
conditions	
,	
such	
as	
decreased

Caregivers	
may	
report	
that	
a	
child	
has	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
the	
desired	
bedtime	
or	
“	
falls

The	
key	
characteristics	
that	
distinguish	
N24SWD	
from	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
or	
circadian	
sleep	
wake	
dis-	
orders	
are	
twofold	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
predictable	
pattern	
of	
misalignment	
between	
the	
child	
’s	
sleep	
patterns	
and	
the	
light	
-	
dark	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
(	
progressive	
delay	
in	
sleep	
onset	
-	
offset	
across	
days	
to	
weeks	
)	
;	
and	
(	
2	
)	
periods	
of	
apparent	
“	
symptom	
remission	
”	
during	
those	
transient	
intervals	
when	
the	
child	
’s	
circadian	
sleep

wake	
propensity	
coincides	
with	
the

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
’	
sleep	
and	
daytime	
functioning	
is	
often	
profound	
.	

Although	
N24SWD	
is	
extremely	
rare	
in	
typically	
developing	
or	
sighted	
children	
,	
it	
has	
been	
reported	
with	
some	
frequency	
in	
children	
with	
intellectual	DISEASE
disabilities	DISEASE
and	
blindness	DISEASE
.	

For	
example	
,	
children	
with	
optic	DISEASE
nerve	DISEASE
hypoplasia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
variety	
of	
under-	
lying	
causes	
,	
especially	
those	
children	
with	
hypoplastic	DISEASE

callosum	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
comor-	DISEASE
bid	DISEASE
severe	DISEASE
intellectual	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
visual	DISEASE
impairments	DISEASE
,	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
have	
features	
of	
N24SWD	
.	
N24SWD	
has	
also	
been	
described	
in	
pediatric	
patients	
with	
Rett	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
(	
a	
genetic	
disorder	
occurring	
almost	
exclusively	
in	
girls	
,	
characterized	
by	
severe	
developmental	
regression

disorder	DISEASE
asso-	
ciated	
with	
an	
abnormality	
of	
chromosome	
15q11	
-	
q13	
.	

The	
common	
mechanism	
in	
all	
of	
these	
disorders	
is	
postulated	
to	
be	
lack	
of	
entrainment	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
that	
results	
from	
the	
failure	
to	
perceive	
and/or	
attend	
to	
social	
/	
environmental	
zeitgebers	
(	
time	
cues	
)	
.	

There	
have	
also	
been	
several	
case	
reports	
which	
describe	
the	
emergence	
of	
N24SWD	
in	
intellectually	
normal	
sighted	
children	
or	
adolescents	
who	
have	
limited	
or	
inappropriate	
exposure	
to	
environmental	
and	
other	
entraining

)	
.	

These	
individuals	
are	
likely	
to	
have	
significant	
psychiatric	DISEASE
impairments	DISEASE
that	
predispose	
them	
to	
avoid-	
ance	
of	
social	
interactions

Little	
is	
known	
about	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
the	
clinical	
entity	
of	
N24SWD	
in	
the	
pedi-

the

the

There	
may	
be	
varying

in	
children

with	
differences	
in	
regard	
to	
symptom

and	
chronicity	
that	
are	
related	
to	
the	
underlying

children	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
neurologic	DISEASE
conditions	DISEASE
such	DISEASE
as	DISEASE

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
intrinsic	
period	
of	
the	
human	
circadian	
pacemaker	
is	
usually	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
and	
requires	
daily	
input	
from	
the	
environment	
to	
maintain	
synchrony	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
.	

The	
light	
-	
dark	
cycle	
is	
the	
most	
important	
environmental	
time	
cue	
(	
zeitgeber	
)	
in	
humans	
(	
as	
in	
other	
species	
)	
,	
although	
nonphotic	
time	
cues	
also	
play	
a	
role	
in	
normal	
entrainment	
.	

A	
lack	
of	
photic	
input	
to	
the	
circadian	
pacemaker	
is	
clearly	
the	
cause	
of	
nonentrained	
rhythms	
in	
totally	
blind	
people	
.	

It	
has	
been	
suggested	
that	
,	
in	
sighted	
individuals	
,	
a	
systematic	
delay	
due	
to	
inadequate	
exposure	
to	
light	
may	
contribute	
to	
the	
development	
of	
N24SWD	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
disorder	
may	
be	
caused	
by	
an	
extremely	
prolonged	
endogenous	
circadian	
period	
that	
is	
outside	
of	
the	
range	
for	
entrainment	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
or	
by	
an	
alteration	
in	
the	
response	
of	
the	
circadian	
clock	
to	
the	
entraining	
effects	
of	
light	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Sleep	
studies	
yield	
different	
results	
depending	
on	
the	
degree	
of	
synchrony	
between	
sleep	
times	
and	
the	
circadian	
pacemaker	
at	
the	
time	
when	
the	
sleep	
study	
is	
performed	
.	

Recording	
of	
sleep	
log	
and	
actigraphy	
over	
prolonged	
periods	
(	
at	
least	
14	
days	
,	
but	
ideally	
longer	
in	
blind	
individuals	
)	
demonstrate	
the	
lack	
of	
a	
stable	
relationship	
between	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
and	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
.	

When	
sleep	
sched-	
ules	
follow	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
propensity	
for	
sleep	
and	
wake	
,	
sleep	
onset	
and	
wake	
times	
are	
typically	
delayed	
each	
day	
.	

Serial	
measurements	
of	
circadian	
rhythms	
,	
such	
as	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
,	
usually	
show	
a	
progressive	
daily	
delay	
of	
the	
phase	
of	
the	
rhythm	
consistent	
with	
a	
period	
that	
is	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiologic	
Subtypes	
Totally	
blind	
patients	
with	
N24SWD	
are	
clinically	
different	
than	
sighted	
patients	
.	

In	
sighted	
patients	
with	
N24SWD	
,	
the	
circadian	
period	
is	
often	
25	
hours	
or	
longer	
,	
whereas	
in	
totally	
blind	
patients	
with	
the	
disorder	
,	
the	
circadian	
period	
follows	
an	
average	
period	
length	
which	
is	
often	
closer	
to	
24	
hours	
and	
rarely	
may	
be	
shorter	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

Some	
individuals

progressive	
delay

their	
sleep	
period	
by	
30	
minutes

may	
play	
a	
role	
in	
the	
development

In	
many	
of	
these	
cases	
,	
however	
,	
multiple	
physio-	
logic	
,	
behavioral	
,	
and	
environmental	
factors	
contribute	
to	
the	
condition	
.	

In	
the	
major-	
ity	
of	
these	
cases	
,	
the	
disorder	
should	
be	
coded	
as	
N24SWD	
.	

This	
includes	
non-24-

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
is	
only	
limited	
knowledge	
of	
the	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
sighted	
persons	
with	
N24SWD	
.	

The	
primary	
risk	
factor	
in	
sighted	
persons	
appears	
to	
be	
a	
long	
circa-	
dian	
period	
that	
is	
beyond	
the	
range	
of	
entrainment	
to	
a	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
or	
a	
progressive	
delay	
due	
to	
inappropriate	
exposure	
to	
light	
.	

This	
risk	
may	
explain	
the	
overlap	
between	
DSWPD	
and	
N24SWD	
.	

Future	
studies	
are	
needed	
to	
understand	
the	
role	
of	
genetic	
predisposition	
,	
environmental	
or	
social	
cues	
and	
traumatic

Essential	
Features	
Shift	
work	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
by	
complaints	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
or	
excessive	
sleepi-	
ness	
that	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
work	
hours	
that	
occur	
,	
at	
least	
in	
part	
,	
during	
the	
usual	
sleep	
episode	
.	

There	
are	
several	
types	
of	
shift	
-	
work	
schedules	
,	
including	
evening	
shifts	
,	
night	
shifts	
,	
early	
morning	
shifts	
,	
rotating	
shifts	
,	
split	
shifts	
,	
on	
-	
call	
overnight	
duty	
,	
and	
long	
duration	
work	
shifts	
that	
include	
work	
hours	
at	
night	
.	

The	
sleep	
distur-	
bance	
is	
most	
commonly	
reported	
in	
association	
with	
night	
shifts	
,	
early	
morning	
shifts	
,	
and	
rotating	
shifts	
.	

Total	
sleep	
time	
is	
typically	
curtailed	
by	
one	
to	
four	
hours	
,	
and	
sleep	
quality	
is	
perceived	
as	
unsatisfactory	
in	
night	
,	
early	
morning	
,	
and	
rotating	
shift	
workers	
as	
well	
as	
in	
those	
who	
work	
long	
-	
duration	
shifts	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
impairment	
of	
performance	
at	
work	
,	
reduced	
alertness	DISEASE
may	
also	
be	
associated	
with	
consequences	
for	
safety	
during	
the	
work	
schedule	
and	
on	
the	
commute	
to	
and	
from	
work	
.	

The	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
occurs	
despite	
attempts	
to	
optimize	
environmental	
conditions	
for	
sleep	
.	

The	
condition	
usually	
persists	
only	
for	
the	
duration	
of	
the	
shift	
work	
schedule	
.	

However	
,	
in	
some	
individuals	
,	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
may	
persist	
beyond	
the	
duration	
of	
shift	
work	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Early	
morning	
work	
shifts	
starting	
between	
4:00	
a.m.	
and	
7:00	
a.m.	
can	
also	
be	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
difficulty	DISEASE
in	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
initiation	DISEASE
as	
well	
as	
difficulty

Permanent	
evening

may	
be	
primarily	
associated	
with

.	

Excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
usually	
occurs	
during	
work	
shifts	
(	
mainly	
night	
,	
early	
morning	
,	
and	
rotating	
shifts	
)	
,	
often	
accompanied	
by	
the	
need	
to	
nap	
and	
by	
impaired	
mental	
ability	
due	
to	
the	
reduced	
alertness	
.	

Reduced	
alertness	DISEASE
and	
increased	
fatigue	DISEASE
throughout	
the	
waking	
period	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
reduced	
performance	
capacity	
,	
and	
with	
consequences	
for	
safety	
.	

Also	
,	
major	
portions	
of	
free	
time	
may	
have	
to	
be	
used	
for	
recovery	
of	
sleep	
,	
resulting	
in	
adverse	
social	
consequences	
.	

When	
compared	
with	
shift	
workers	
without	
shift	
work	
disorder	
,	
patients	
with	
shift	
work	
disorder	
report	
greater	
mood	
problems	
,	
such	
as	
impatience	
,	
avoidance	
of	
interaction	
with	
coworkers	
,	
a	
higher	
risk

depression	DISEASE
,	
impaired	DISEASE
social	DISEASE

,	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
lower	DISEASE

Patients	
with	
shift	
work	
disorder	
also	
have	
a	
higher	
risk	
of	
subjective	
health	
complaints	
,	
ulcers	DISEASE
,	
and	
substance	DISEASE
abuse	DISEASE
.	

Risk	
for	
sleepiness	
-	
related	
errors	
and	
accidents	DISEASE
are	
highest	
at	
night	
,	
especially	
in	
the	
early	
morning	
hours	
.	

Drowsy	
driving	
accident	
risk	
is	
highest	
in	
the	
morning	
hours	
when	
night	
shift	
workers	
commute	
home	
and	
early	
morning	
workers	
commute	
to	
work	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
There	
are	
substantial	
individual	
differences	
in	
the	
ability	
to	
adjust	
to	
shift	
work	
.	

However	
,	
mechanisms	
underlying	
these	
individual	
differences	
are	
not	
known	
.	

Requirement	
of	
extended	
work	
hours	
,	
such	
as	
on	
-	
call	
overnight	
duty	
and	
long	
-	
duration	
work	
shifts	
that	
include	
work	
hours	
at	
night	
,	
represents	
a	
specific	
clinical	
subtype	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
the	
circadian	
misalignment	
(	
having	
to	
work	
during	
the	
night	
)	
,	
sleep	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
and	
fatigue	DISEASE
associated	
with	
prolonged	
continuous	
work	
may	
increase	
the	
severity	
of	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
performance	
impairments	
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
depends	
on	
the	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
in	
the	
population	
.	

It	
has	
been	
estimated	
that	
approximately	
20	
%	
of	
the	
workforce	
in	
indus-	
trialized	
countries	
is	
employed	
in	
a	
job	
that	
requires	
shift	
work	
.	

Although	
the	
actual	
prevalence	
of	
clinically	
significant	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
and	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
due	
to	
work	
schedules	
is	
unknown	
,	
the	
total	
number	
of	
night	
-	
shift	
workers	
suggests	
that	
an	
estimated	
prevalence	
of	
2	
%	
to	
5	
%	
of	
the	
general	
population	
is	
reasonable	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
among	
rotating-	
and	
night	
-	
shift	
workers	
has	
been	
estimated	
to	
be	
between	
~10	
%	
and	
38	
%	
.	

These	
figures	
do	
not	
,	
however	
,	
include	
individuals	
with	
early	
morning	
or	
split	
shift	
work	
,	
which	
may	
be	
other	
at	
-	
risk	
groups	
.	

There	
is	
no	
known	
sex	
or	
racial	
difference	
in	
vulnerability	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Depending	
on	
the	
type	
of	
shift	
,	
circadian	
preference	
may	
influence	
the	
ability	
to	
adjust	
to	
or	
tolerate	
shift	
work	
.	

For	
example	
,	
individuals	
described	
as	
morning	
types	
obtain	
shorter	
daytime	
sleep	
after	
a	
night	
shift	
.	

Persons	
with	
comorbid	
medical	
,	
psychiat-	
ric	
,	
and	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
and	
individuals	
with	
a	
strong	
need	
for	
stable	
hours	
of	
sleep	
may	
be	
at	
particular	
risk	
.	

Social	
pressures	
before	
and	
after	
a	
work	
shift	
also	
contribute	
to	
short	
sleep	
durations	
in	
shift	
workers	
(	
e.g.	
,	
social	
inter-	
actions	
with	
family	
and	
friends	
,	
domestic	
obligations	
,	
a	
second	
job	
,	
and	
leisure	
activ-	
ities	
)	
.	

Social	
pressures	
also	
diminish	
the	
desire	
or	
willingness	
to	
maintain	
a	
consis-	
tent	
daytime	
sleep	
schedule	
on	
days	
off	
,	
thereby	
reducing	
the	
likelihood	
of	
circadian	
adjustment	
.

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	

The	
condition	
is	
closely	
linked	
to	
work	
schedules	
and	
typically	
remits	
when	
the	
major	
sleep	
episode	
is	
scheduled	
at	
a	
conventional	
time	
.	

Because	
there	
are	
so	
many	
different	
work	
schedules	
,	
ranging	
from	
an	
occasional	
overnight	
shift	
to	
regular	
night	
work	
,	
the	
course	
is	
quite	
variable	
.	

Because	
shift	
work	
is	
often	
combined	
with	
extended	
hours	
of	
duty	
,	
fatigue	DISEASE
can	
be	
a	
complicating	
factor	
.	

Circadian	
adaptation	
is	
often	
counteracted	
by	
exposure	
to	
light	
at	
the	
wrong	
time	
of	
the	
day	
and	
the	
tendency	
of	
most	
workers	
to	
resume	
full	
daytime	
activities	
and	
nighttime	
sleep	
during	
weekends	
and	
vacations	
.	

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
in	
some	
individuals	
,	
the	
condition	
may	
lead	
to	
chronic	
sleep	
disturbances	
.	

Complications	
may	
include	
exacerbation	
of	
gastrointestinal	
,	
met-	
abolic	
,	
reproductive	
,	
neoplastic	
,	
and	
cardiovascular	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Disruptions	
of	
social	
and	
family	
life	
are	
frequent	
.	

Drug	
and	
alcohol	DISEASE
dependency	DISEASE
may	
result	
from	
attempts	
to	
improve	
the	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
disturbances	
produced	
by	
shift	
work	
.

and	
excessive	DISEASE

due

the

pose

Disorders	
Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	

The	
condition	
is	
thought	
to	
be	
directly	
related	
to	
circadian	
misalignment	
and	
sleep	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
.	

The	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
is	
generated	
by	
a	
circadian	
alerting	
process	
that	
corre-	
sponds	
with	
the	
time	
that	
the	
worker	
needs	
to	
sleep	
.	

The	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
during	
the	
night	
and	
early	
morning	
appears	
to	
be	
partly	
related	
to	
cumulative	
sleep	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
and	
partly	
due	
to	
a	
decreased	
circadian	
alerting	
signal	
that	
corresponds	
with	
the	
work	
time	
and	
the	
commute	
to	
and	
from	
work	
.	

Tolerance	
to	
night	
work	
varies	
considerably	
and	
may	
involve	
differences	
in	
the	
degree	
of	
circadian	
adaptation	
(	
“	
clock	
resetting	
”	
)	
to	
a	
night	
-	
work	
,	
day	
-	
sleep	
schedule	
.	

Alternatively	
,	
tolerance	
may	
be	
related	
to	
individual	
differences	
in	
response	
to	
circadian	
and	
homeostatic	
influences	
on	
sleep	
and	
wakeful-	
ness	
regulation	
.	

Environmental	
and	
social	
factors	
may	
exacerbate	
sleep	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
associated	
with	
shift	
work	
schedules	
.	

Objective	
Findings	

The	
condition	
can	
usually	
be	
diagnosed	
by	
history	
.	

Sleep	
logs	
and	
actigraphy	
are	
rec-	
ommended	
to	
demonstrate	
a	
disrupted	
sleep	
-	
wake	
pattern	
consistent	
with	
shift	
work	
disorder	
.	

Polysomnographic	
recordings	
,	
while	
not	
required	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
,	
are	
useful	
if	
the	
etiology	
of	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
is	
in	
question	
(	
for	
example	
to	
rule	
out	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
or	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
)	
.	

Polysomnography	
during	
a	
typical	
daytime	
sleep	
episode	
after	
a	
work	
shift	
also	
can	
be	
useful	
to	
determine	
the	
severity	
of	
the	
sleep	
disruption	
,	
although	
this	
is	
undertaken	
almost	
exclusively	
for	
research	
studies	
of	
shift	
work	
disor-	
der	
.	

Polysomnography	
may	
demonstrate	
impaired	
sleep	
quality	
,	
with	
prolonged	
sleep	
latency	
,	
sleep	
maintenance	
difficulty	
,	
or	
shortened	
total	
sleep	
time	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
sleep	
episode	
in	
relation	
to	
the	
underlying	
phase	
of	
the	
circadian	
timing	
system	
.	

The	
sleep	
episode	
may	
be	
fragmented	
,	
with	
frequent	
arousals	DISEASE
and	
awaken-	
ings	CHEMICAL
.	

The	
Multiple	
Sleep	
Latency	
Test	
(	
MSLT	
)	
may	
demonstrate	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
during	
the	
time	
of	
the	
work	
shift	
.	

If	
available	
,	
measures	
of	
the	
unmasked	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
rhythm	
are	
useful	
to	
indicate	
the	
degree	
of	
circadian	
misalignment	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
should	
be	
differentiated	
from	
that	
caused	
by	
other	
primary	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
or	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
.	

Insufficient	
sleep	
related	
to	
conflicting	
daytime	
activities	
(	
for	
example	
,	
child	
care	
)	
or	
from	
environmental	
interference	
with	
sleep	
(	
for	
example	
,	
daytime	
noise	
)	
often	
contributes	
to	
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

Sometimes	
patients	
with	
DSWPD	
may	
adopt	
a	
night	
-	
work	
schedule	
that	
is	
more	
con-	
gruent	
with	
their	
sleep	
preferences	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
and	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
may	
also	
suggest	
other	
persistent	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep	
-	
wake	
disorders	
.	

However	
,	
historical	
informa-	
tion	
on	
the	
relation	
between	
the	
occurrence	
of	
disturbed	
sleep	
and	
work	
-	
hour	
distribu-	
tion	
should	
provide	
sufficient	
information	
to	
indicate	
the	
correct	
diagnosis	
.	

Increasing	
frustration	
,	
negative	
expectations	
,	
and	
poor	
sleep	
hygiene	
may	
predispose	
the	
person	
to	
the	
development	
of	
coexisting	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
that	
could	
persist	
beyond	
the	
shift	
work	
schedule	
(	
i.e.	
,	
shift	
work	
may	
represent	
a	
precipitating	
event	
that	
leads	
to	
chronic	
problems	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
)	
.	

Drug	
and	
alcohol	DISEASE
abuse	DISEASE
or	
dependency	
may	
result	
from	
efforts	
to	
treat	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Although	
there	
is	
sufficient	
information	
regarding	
the	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
in	
indus-	
trialized	
populations	
,	
less	
information	
is	
available	
regarding	
the	
actual	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
and	
its	
impact	
on	
health	
and	
safety	
.	

Further	
research	
is	
needed	
to	
improve	
the	
definition	
of	
what	
constitutes	
shift	
work	
disorder	
,	
to	
develop	
diagnostic	
tools	
for	
shift	
work	
disorder	
,	
to	
determine	
the	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
using	
diagnostic	
criteria	
,	
to	
elucidate	
the	
burden	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
over	
and	
above	
that	
which	
may	
be	
due	
to	
shift	
work	
in	
general	
,	
to	
investigate	
mechanisms	
underlying	
the	
health	
and	
safety	
consequences	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
,	
and	
to	
determine	
which	
shift	
workers	
are	
at	
greatest	
risk	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
there	
is	
limited	
information	
on	
the	
role	
of	
age	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
circadian	
chronotype	
on	
the	
vulnerability	
to	
shift	
work	
disorder

Essential	
Features	
Jet	
lag	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
temporary	
mismatch	
between	
the	
timing	
of	
the	
sleep	
and	
wake	
cycle	
generated	
by	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
clock	
and	
that	
of	
the	
sleep	
and	
wake	
pattern	
required	
by	
a	
change	
in	
time	
zone	
.	

Individuals	
complain	
of	
disturbed	
sleep	
,	
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
fatigue	DISEASE
,	
and	
impaired	
daytime	
function	
.	

The	
severity	
and	
duration	
of	
symptoms	
is	
dependent	
on	
the	
number	
of	
time	
zones	
traveled	
,	
the	
ability	
to	
sleep	
while	
traveling	
,	
exposure	
to	
appropriate	
circadian	
times	
cues	
in	
the	
new	
environment	
,	
tolerance	
to	
circadian	
misalignment	
when	
awake	
during	
the	
bio-	
logical	
night	
,	
and	
the	
direction	
of	
the	
travel	
.	

Eastward	
travel	
(	
requiring	
advancing	
circadian	
rhythms	
and	
sleep	
-	
wake	
hours	
)	
is	
usually	
more	
difficult	
to	
adjust	
to	
than	
westward	
travel	
.	

Associated	
Features	

In	
addition	
to	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
and	
decreased	
daytime	
alertness	
,	
associated	
features	
may	
include	
general	
malaise	
and	
gastrointestinal	DISEASE
symptoms	DISEASE
.	

Numerous	
other	
variables	
related	
to	
travel	
,	
such	
as	
sleep	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
,	
decreased	DISEASE
mobility	DISEASE
,	
and	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
and/or	
caffeine	CHEMICAL
intake	
,	
contribute	
to	
the	
overall	
fatigue	DISEASE
.	

Daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
can	
lead	
to	
memory	
diffi-	
culties	
,	
problems	
concentrating	
,	
driving	
and	
flying	
,	
and	
to	
impaired	
decision	
-	
making	
.	

Sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
and	
circadian	
misalignment	
associated	
with	
jet	
lag	
may	
also	
impair	
athletic	
performance	
.	

Effects	
of	
jet	
lag	
not	
only	
affect	
travelers	
,	
but	
also	
can	
have	
significant	
consequences	
for	
airline	
pilots	
and	
flight	
attendants	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
There	
are	
individual	
differences	
in	
the	
ability	
to	
adjust	
to	
rapid	
shifts	
in	
time	
zones	
;	
however	
,	
specific	
clinical	
subtypes	
have	
not	
been	
identified	
.	

Demographics	
Jet	
lag	
affects	
all	
age	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
racial	
groups	
.	

Limited	
available	
data	
suggest	
that	
older	
individuals	
may	
experience	
fewer	
jet	
lag	
symptoms	
compared	
with	
younger	
individu-	
als	
.	

However	
,	
the	
data	
have	
limitations	
and	
further	
research	
is	
needed	
to	
better	
define	
the	
relationship	
between	
age	
and	
the	
development	
of	
jet	
lag	
disorder	
.	

There	
are	
no	
studies	
on	
the	
prevalence	
of	
jet	
lag	
disorder	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Disturbed	
sleep	
and/or	
shortened	
sleep	
duration	
before	
and	
during	
travel	
contribute	
to	
jet	
lag	
symptoms	
.	

Prolonged	
uncomfortable	
sitting	
positions	
,	
air	
quality	
and	
pressure	
,	
stress	
,	
and	
excessive	
caffeine	CHEMICAL
and	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
consumption	
may	
increase	
the	
severity	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
impaired	
alertness	
and	
function	
associated	
with	
transmeridian	
travel	
.	

Eastward	
travel	
often	
leads	
to	
difficulties	
with	
sleep	
onset	
as	
attempts	
to	
sleep	
are	
made	
at	
an	
earlier	
internal	
circadian	
time	
when	
the	
travelers	
’	
biological	
clock	
is	
pro-	
moting	
alertness	
(	
i.e.	
,	
biological	
day	
)	
.	

Difficulty	
awakening	
and	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
fatigue	DISEASE
occur	
because	
wake	
time	
also	
occurs	
at	
an	
earlier	
biological	
time	
when	
the	
circadian	
clock	
is	
still	
promoting	
sleep	
(	
i.e.	
,	
during	
the	
travelers	
’	
biological	
night	
)	
.	

Westward	
jet	
travel	
often	
leads	
to	
sleepiness	DISEASE
and	
fatigue	DISEASE
in	
the	
evening	
hours	
of	
the	
new	
time	
zone	
as	
the	
internal	
circadian	
clock	
of	
the	
traveler	
is	
promoting	
sleep	
(	
i.e.	
,	
biological	
night	
)	
.	

Sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
in	
the	
new	
time	
zone	
is	
typically	
manifest	
as	
a	
sleep	
maintenance	
issue	
with	
early	
morning	DISEASE
awakenings	DISEASE
and	
difficulty	
returning	
to	
sleep	
because	
the	
internal	
circadian	
clock	
of	
the	
traveler	
is	
promoting	
wakefulness	
during	
the	
sleep	
episode	
(	
i.e.	
,	
biological	
day	
)	
.	

Basic	
circadian	
science	
principles	
suggest	
that	
inappropriately	
timed	
exposure	
to	
light	
and	
darkness	
during	
and	
immediately	
after	
jet	
travel	
can	
shift	
the	
circadian	
clock	
in	
the	
wrong	
direction	
,	
thereby	
increasing	
the	
duration	
of	
jet	
lag	
symptoms	
.	

Time	
at	
destina-	
tion	
upon	
arrival	
may	
also	
influence	
jet	
lag	
symptoms	
with	
fewer	
symptoms	
reported	
following	
midday	
arrivals	
after	
eastward	
travel	
.	

An	
individual	
’s	
innate	
circadian

Jet	
lag	
is	
often	
reported	
to	
be	
worse	
after	
eastward	
than	
westward	
travel	
.	

Westward	
travel	
may	
generally	
be	
easier	
because	
the	
genetically	
determined	
period	
of	
the	
cir-	
cadian	
clock	
in	
humans	
is	
on	
average	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

A	
circadian	
period	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
is	
associated	
with	
a	
circadian	
drive	
or	
physiological	
tendency	
for	
bed	
and	
wake	
times	
to	
be	
later	
,	
thus	
making	
it	
easier	
to	
shift	
the	
circadian	
clock	
during	
west-	
ward	
travel	
to	
more	
delayed	
sleep	
and	
wake	
times	
.	

However	
,	
20	
%	
to	
25	
%	
of	
humans	
have	
circadian	
periods	
that	
are	
near	
to	
,	
or	
shorter	
than	
,	
24	
hours	
,	
and	
these	
individuals	
may	
find	
it	
easier	
to	
adapt	
to	
eastward	
travel

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Jet	
lag	
is	
usually	
a	
temporary	
condition	
.	

Symptoms	
begin	
approximately	
one	
to	
two	
days	
after	
air	
travel	
across	
at	
least	
two	
time	
zones	
and	
are	
self	
-	
limited	
.	

The	
severity	
and	
duration	
of	
symptoms	
are	
usually	
in	
proportion	
to	
the	
number	
of	
time	
zones	
trav-	
eled	
and	
the	
direction	
of	
travel	
.	

It	
is	
estimated	
that	
it	
takes	
one	
day	
per	
time	
zone	
for	
circadian	
rhythms	
to	
adjust	
to	
the	
local	
time	
.	

However	
,	
if	
traveling	
more	
than	
six	
time	
zones	
,	
circadian	
rhythms	
may	
shift	
in	
the	
opposite	
direction	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
prolonged	
period	
of	
adjustment	
that	
may	
last	
up	
to	
several	
weeks	
and	
increased	
severity	
of	
jet	
-	
lag	
symptoms	
.	

Exposure	
to	
light	
at	
inappropriate	
times	
may	
prolong	
the	
time	
of	
adjust-	
ment	
by	
shifting	
the	
circadian	
rhythms	
in	
the	
opposite	
direction	
.	

Menstrual

and	
repetitive

Developmental	
Issues	

The	
effect	
of	
age	
on	
the	
development

symptoms	
is	
unknown

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
symptoms	
of	
jet	
lag	
disorder	
are	
due	
to	
both	
desynchronization	
of	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythms	
with	
local	
time	
and	
sleep	
disturbance	
.	

The	
severity	
of	
symptoms	
can	
be	
influenced	
by	
the	
environment	
and	
behaviors	
of	
the	
traveler	
.	

Factors	
inherent	
to	
jet	
travel	
,	
including	
prolonged	
time	
spent	
sitting	
in	
a	
confined	
space	
,	
ability	
to	
sleep	
on	
long	
-	
haul	
flights	
,	
decreased	
physical	
activity	
,	
and	
a	
low	
oxygen	CHEMICAL
environment	
,	
may	
influence	
severity	
.

Human	
consciousness	
consists	
of	
three	
essential	
states	
:	
Wake	
,	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
and	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
three	
states	
are	
modulated	
by	
a	
host	
of	
influences	
including	
the	
degree	
of	
ami-	CHEMICAL
nergic	
and	
cholinergic	
neurochemical	
bias	
,	
central	
nervous	
system	
(	
CNS	
)	
activation	
,	
Parasomnias	DISEASE
and	
the	
degree	
of	
endogenous	
versus	
exogenous	
input	
.	

Under	
normal	
physiologic	
conditions	
,	
which	
include	
homeostatic	
drive	
and	
circadian	
rhythmicity	
,	
the	
process	
of	
state	
declaration	
is	
maintained	
in	
a	
stable	
and	
predictable	
fashion	
throughout	
a	
24	
-	
hour	
period	
.	

However	
,	
as	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
oscillates	
,	
the	
normally	
distinct	
states	
of	
con-	
sciousness	
may	
be	
rendered	
into	
a	
state	
that	
is	
not	
fully	
declared	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
tempo-	
rary	
unstable	
state	
of	
dissociation	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
and	
wake	
can	
be	
viewed	
as	
occurring	
on	
a	
spectrum	
rather	
than	
being	
entirely	
dichotomous	
states	
.	

Parasomnias	DISEASE
are	
the	
result	
of	
such	
state	
dissociation	
.	

Recent	
research	
has	
shown	
that	
com-	
binations	
of	
one	
or	
more	
of	
these	
states	
do	
occur	
and	
may	
result	
in	
unstable	
states	
of	
altered	
consciousness	
manifesting	
as	
parasomnias	DISEASE
.	

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
such	
as	
sleepwalking	
,	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
,	
and	
confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
are	
an	
admixture	
of	
wakefulness	
and	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

Higher	
cognitive	
function	
is	
severely	
impaired	
,	
if	
not	
absent	
,	
while	
the	
potential	
for	
motor	
capacity	
has	
,	
for	
the	
most	
part	
,	
been	
retained	
.	

REM	
sleep	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
RBD	DISEASE
)	
is	
an	
admixture	
of	
REM

coupled

waking	
or	
NREM

levels	
of	
tonic	
EMG	
activity	
.	

All	
three	
states	
may	
be	
present	
in	
the	
same	
individual	
as	
an	
overlap	
of	
disorders	
.	

The	
comingling	
of	
basic	
states

is	
the	
result	
of	
different	
forms	
of	
pathophysiology

essentially	
resulting	
in	
a	
brain	
in	
which	
certain	
areas	
are	
deactivated	
(	
asleep	
)	
and	
others	
remain	
activated	
(	
awake	
)	
.	

This	
CNS	
activation	
,	
with	
concomitant	
skeletal	
muscle	
and	
auto-	
nomic	
nervous	
system	
activation	
,	
is	
believed	
to	
reflect	
a	
functional	
disabling	
of	
,	
or	
damage	
to	
,	
brain	
areas	
usually	
responsible	
for	
the	
inhibition	
of	
these	
activities	
during	
sleep	
.	

Additionally	
,	
sleep	
inertia	
,	
sleep	
state	
instability	
,	
and	
locomotor	
/	
central	
pattern	
generators	
are	
thought	
to	
contribute	
to	
the	
occurrence	
of	
NREM	DISEASE
parasomnias	DISEASE
.	

NREM	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
frequently	
appear	
to	
involve	
the	
disinhibition	
of	
“	
basic	
drive	
states	
”	
such	
as	
feeding	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
aggression	DISEASE
.	

Here	
,	
it	
has	
been	
postulated	
that	
central	
pattern	
generators	
elicit	
primal	
fixed	
action	
patterns	
that	
would	
otherwise	
have	
been	
inhibited	
by	
the	
prefrontal	
cortex	
during	
wake	
.	

In	
this	
regard	
,	
aggression	DISEASE
is	
typ-	
ically	
abrupt	
in	
onset	
and	
characterized	
by	
apparent	
instinctual	
defensive	
posturing	
as	
opposed	
to	
behaviors	
that	
are	
complex	
and	
procedural	
.	

These	
can	
emerge	
in	
pathologic	
forms	
with	
the	
parasomnias	DISEASE
,	
as	
seen	
with	
sleep	
related	
aggression	DISEASE
and	
locomotion	
,	
sleep	
related	
eating	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
SRED	
)	
,	
and	
abnormal	
sleep	
related	
sexual	
behaviors	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
RBD	DISEASE
often	
results	
from	
serious	
neuropathology	DISEASE
.	

Initially	
,	
this	
neuropathology	DISEASE
affects	
the	
area	
of	
the	
brain	
responsible	
for	
inhibiting	
muscle	
tone	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
dreams	
may	
be	
enacted	
.	

In	
the	
case	
of	
REM	
-	
related	
behaviors	
,	
the	
experience	
and	
activity	
reflect	
the	
actual	
,	
often	
aggressive	
content	
of	
a	
dream	
.	

It	
is	
frequently	
pos-	
sible	
to	
correlate	
observed	
movements	
with	
later	
descriptions	
of	
the	
dream	
.	

The	
initial	
appearance	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
symptoms	
is	
often	
followed	
years	
later	
by	
the	
development	
of	
neu-	
rodegenerative	
disorders	
,	
particularly	
Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
and	
related	
synucleinopathies	DISEASE
.	

Abnormal	
sleep	
related	
movements	DISEASE
comprise	
a	
separate	
category	
of	
disorders	
,	
which	
is	
detailed	
in	
the	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
section	
.	

Unlike	
the	
parasomnias	DISEASE
,	
which	
typ-	
ically	
entail	
more	
complex	
movements	
and	
behavior	
,	
the	
movement	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
encompass	
a	
broad	
range	
of	
predominantly	
simple	
motoric	
activities	
:	
myoclonic	DISEASE
,	
repetitive	
,	
rocking	
,	
rhythmic	
,	
grinding	
,	
cramping	DISEASE
,	
fragmentary	
,	
dystonic	
,	
or	
dyskinetic	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
or	
tremors	DISEASE
,	
which	
are	
not	
usually	
associated	
with	
dream	
mentation	
or	
experiential	
concomitants	
.	

Parasomnias	DISEASE
involve	
sleep	DISEASE
related	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
and	
experiences	
over	
which	
there	
is	
no	
conscious	
deliberate	
control	
.	

There	
are	
ten	
core	
categories	
of	
parasomnias	DISEASE
listed	
in	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
.	

Only	
one	
of	
the	
core	
cat-	
egories	
,	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
requires	
video	
-	
polysomnographic	
documentation	
as	
one	
of	
the	
essen-	
tial	
diagnostic	
criteria	
.	

However	
,	
for	
most	
of	
the	
other	
parasomnias	DISEASE
,	
polysomnographic	
monitoring	
can	
provide	
corroborative	
documentation	
in	
support	
of	
the	
clinical	
diagnosis	
.	

Considerable	
advances	
have	
taken	
place	
in	
understanding	
the	
neurophysiologic	
aspects	
of	
abnormal	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
associated	
with	
the	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Advances	
in	
the	
clinical	
understanding	
of	
these	
NREM	
sleep	
parasomnias	DISEASE
have	
occurred	
as	
well	
,	
particularly	
in	
regard	
to	
their	
prevalence	
and	
severity	
in	
adults	
.	

In	
regard	
to	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
long	
-	
term	
delayed	
emergence	
of	
neurodegeneration	DISEASE
has	
frequently	
been	
found	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
and	
older	
adults	
following	
onset	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

When	
combined	
with	
thorough	
clinical	
interviews

Essential	
Features	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
consist	
of	
complex	
behaviors	
that	
are	
usually	
initiated	
during	
partial	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
slow	
wave	
(	
N3	
)	
sleep	
.	

Most	
episodes	
are	
brief	
,	
but	
they	
may	
last	
as	
long	
as	
30	
to	
40	
minutes	
in	
some	
children	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
and	
shouting	
may	
accompany	
these	
events	
.	

The	
eyes	
are	
usually	
open	
during	
an	
episode	
and	
,	
not	
uncom-	
monly	
,	
are	
wide	
open	
with	
a	
confused	
“	
glassy	
”	
stare	
.	

The	
patient	
with	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
may	
be	
very	
difficult	
to	
awaken	
and	
,	
when	
awakened	
,	
is	
often	
confused	
.	

There	
is	
usually	
amnesia	DISEASE
for	
these	
episodes	
,	
although	
adults	
may	
remember	
fragments	
of	
episodes	
.	

Dream	
-	
like	
mentation	
is	
sometimes	
reported	
in	
adults	
.	

Other	
high	
-	
level	
cog-	
nitive	
functions	
such	
as	
attention	
,	
planning	
,	
social	
interaction	
,	
and	
intent	
are	
absent	
.	

Because	
disorders	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
usually	DISEASE
originate	DISEASE
from	DISEASE
slow	
wave	
sleep	
,	
they	
most	
often	
emerge	
in	
the	
first	
third	
or	
first	
half	
of	
the	
typical	
sleep	
period	
.	

They	
may	
occur	
during	
other	
times	
of	
increased	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
,	
such	
as	
during	
recovery	
sleep	
following	
sleep	
deprivation	
.	

They	
rarely	
arise	
from	
a	
daytime	
nap	
.	

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
are	
encountered	
most	
commonly	
in	
children	
and	
typically	
resolve	
by	
puberty	
but	
may	
persist	
(	
or	
,	
infrequently	
,	
arise	
de	
novo	
)	
in	
adolescence	
or	
adulthood	
.	

Confusional	DISEASE
Arousals	DISEASE
:	
Confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
,	
unlike	
sleepwalking	
,	
occur	
with	
the	
patient	
in	
bed	
.	

When	
the	
patient	
leaves	
the	
bed	
,	
sleepwalking	
has	
been	
initiated	
.	

Confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
often	
start	
with	
the	
individual	
sitting	
up	
in	
bed	
and	
looking	
about	
in	
a	
confused	
manner	
.	

Sleepwalking	
:	
Sleepwalking	
episodes	
typically	
begin	
as	
confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
.	

Sleepwalking	DISEASE
episodes	DISEASE
can	
also	
begin	
with	
the	
individual	
immediately	
leaving	
the	
bed	
and	
walking	
or	
even	
“	
bolting	
”	
from	
the	
bed	
and	
running	
.	

Highly	
inappropriate	
,	
agitated	
,	
resistive	
,	
belligerent	
,	
or	
violent	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
can	
also	
occur	
.	

Behaviors	
can	
be	
simple	
and	
non	
–	
goal	
-	
directed	
,	
or	
complex	
and	
protracted	
,	
and	
may	
involve	
inappro-	
priate	
sexual	
activity	
with	
oneself	
or	
an	
individual	
in	
close	
proximity	
such	
as	
a	
bed	
partner	
.	

The	
ambulation	
may	
terminate	
spontaneously	
,	
at	
times	
in	
inappropriate	
places	
,	
or	
the	
sleepwalker	
may	
return	
to	
bed	
,	
lie	
down	
,	
and	
continue	
to	
sleep	
without	
reach-	
ing	
conscious	
awareness	
at	
any	
point	
.	

The	
sleepwalking	
individual	
is	
disoriented	
in	
time	
and	
place	
,	
with	
slow	
speech	
,	
with	
severely	
diminished	
mentation	
,	
and	
blunted	
response	
to	
questions	
or	
requests	
.	

There	
is	
often	
prominent	
anterograde	
and	
retrograde	
memory	
impairment	
.	

Despite	
diminished	
external	
perception	
as	
a	
result	
of	
blockade	
of	
sensory	
input	
,	
the	
individual	
may	
appear	
to	
be	
awake	
during	
some	
or	
most	
of	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
with	
reduced	
vigilance	
and	
impaired	
cognitive	
response	
.	

Sleep	
Terrors	
:	
Sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
differ	
from	
other	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
in	
that	
the	
events	
are	
often	
accompanied	
by	
a	
cry	
or	
piercing	
scream	
,	
accompanied	
by	
autonomic	
nervous	
system	
and	
behavioral	
manifestations	
of	
intense	
fear	
.	

There	
is	
often	
intense	
autonomic	
discharge	
,	
with	
tachycardia	DISEASE
,	
tachypnea	DISEASE
,	
flushing	
of	
the	
skin	
,	
diaphoresis	DISEASE
,	
mydriasis	DISEASE
,	
and	
increased	
muscle	
tone	
.	

The	
person	
usually	
sits	
up	
in	
bed	
;	
is	
unresponsive	
to	
exter-	
nal	
stimuli	
;	
and	
,	
if	
awakened	
,	
is	
confused	
and	
disoriented	
.	

However	
,	
bolting	
out	
of	
bed	
and	
running	
is	
not	
uncommon	
in	
adults	
and	
also	
can	
be	
associated

Associated	
Features	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
are	
devoid	
of	
higher	
cognitive	
functions	
such	
as	
planning	
,	
memory	
from	
before	
an

,	
formation	
of	
a	
memory	
during	
an	
incident	
,	
true	
social	
inter-	
action	
,	
or	
recognition	
of	
others	
.	

Patients	
exhibiting	
disorders	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
are	
not	
con-	
sciously	
aware	
and	
behaviors	
are	
often	
thought	
to	
be	
“	
automatic	
”	
in	
nature

Self

injury	
may	
occur	
as	
well	
as	
injury	
to	
others

close	
proximity

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
in	
particular	
sleepwalking	
,	
can	
involve	
normal	
,	
routine	
behav-	
iors	
that	
are	
inappropriate	
only	
in	
regard	
to	
their	
timing	
.	

More	
often	
,	
however	
,	
sleep-	
walking	
involves	
inappropriate	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
,	
such	
as	
urinating	
in	
a	
wastebasket	
,	
moving	
furniture	
around	
haphazardly	
,	
or	
climbing	
out	
a	
window	
.	

Sleepwalkers	DISEASE
are	
sometimes	
able	
to	
navigate	
in	
familiar	
surroundings	
,	
but	
are	
prone	
to	
bumping	
into	
objects	
or	
falling	
down	
.	

A	
sudden	
arousal	
consistent	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
may	
segue	
rapidly	
into	
agitated	
sleepwalking	
and	
panicky	
running	
and	
other	
potentially	
dangerous	
behav-	
iors	
.	

Self	
-	
injury	
is	
not	
unusual

Cuts	
,	
bruises

other	
injuries	DISEASE
may	
occur	
—	
often	
to	
the	
surprise	
of	
the	
sleepwalker	
once	
awake

Sleepwalkers	DISEASE
are	
reported	
to	
have	
a	
high	
tol-

Knife	
cuts

burns	DISEASE
,	
and	
other	
self

sustained	
during	
sleepwalking	
may	
not	
awaken	
them

Violence	
to	
others	
also	
can	
occur	
with	
adult	
sleepwalking	
,	
especially	
in	
men	
.	

The	
sleepwalker	
does	
not	
generally	
seek	
out	
the	
eventual	
victim	
of	
violence	
.	

More	
typi-	

cally	
,	
a	
person	
attempting	
to	
block	
,	
grab	
,	
restrain	
,	
redirect	
or	
awaken	
a	
sleepwalker	
during	
an	
episode	
may	
be	
violently	
attacked	
,	
even	
if	
they	
are	
family	
members	
or	
friends	
.	

This	
may	
result	
in	
a	
form	
of	
primitive	
defensive	
aggression	DISEASE
including	
pushing	
,	
hitting	
,	
kicking	
,	
or	
throwing	
objects	
.	

This	
pattern	
also	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
when	
technical	
personnel	
have	
attempted	
to	
return	
sleepwalking	
patients	
to	
bed	
.	

In	
extreme	
cases	
,	
victims	
have	
been	
stabbed	
with	
knives	
or	
blunt	
objects	
.	

Such	
inappropriate	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
antisocial	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
have	
legal	
and	
forensic	
implications

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
are	
most	
often	
evaluated	
in	
terms	
of	
predisposing	
,	
priming	
,	
and	
precipitating	
(	
triggering	
)	
factors	
.	

Most	
often	
a	
simultaneous	
co	
-	
occurrence	
of	
these	
factors	
is	
thought	
necessary	
in	
order	
for	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
occur	
.	

However	
,	
the	
reason	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
occurs	
on	
one	
night	
and	
not	
others	
is	
not	
fully	
understood	
.	

A	
genetic	
predisposition	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
and	
several	
studies	
have	
identified	
dif-	
ferent	
genetic	
loci	
and	
modes	
of	
inheritance	
(	
see	
Familial	
Pattern	
,	
below	
)	
.	

In	
childhood	
,	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
can	
usually	
be	
considered	
an	
expected	
and	
normal	
developmental	
sleep	
phenomenon	
,	
apart	
from	
those	
cases	
with	
clinical	
consequences	
.	

However	
,	
dis-	
orders	
of	
arousal	
that	
persist	
beyond	
adolescence	
or	
begin	
in	
adulthood	
can	
often	
be	
problematic	
and	
may	
require	
clinical	
attention

Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Many	
priming	
factors	
for	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
in	
particular	
sleepwalking	
,	
have	
been	
identified	
.	

Sleep	
deprivation	
and	
situational	
stress	
are	
the	
most	
potent	
factors

as	
potential

OSA	DISEASE
and	
other	
sleep	
related	
respiratory	
events	
are	
increasingly	
recognized	
precipitants	
of	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
in	
both	
children

adults

Treatment	
of	
these	
comorbid	
con-	
ditions	
may	
reduce	
or	
eliminate	
the	
occurrence	
of	
disorders	DISEASE

arousal	DISEASE
.	DISEASE

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
may	
also	
be	
triggered	
by	
environmental	
stimuli	
such	
as	
telephone	
calls	
,	
pagers	
,	
messaging	
from	
electronic	
devices	
,	
and	
a	
host	
of	
other	
stimuli

It	
is	
clinically	
important	
to	
note	
that	
first	
responders	
,	
physicians	
,	
and	
others	
on	
call	
may	
be	
vulnerable	
to	
such	
stimuli	
,	
increasing	
the	
potential	
for	
inappropriate	
responses

behavior

Alcohol	CHEMICAL
has	
been	
identified	
in	
previous	
reports

However	
,	
the	
amnesia	DISEASE

with	
dis-	
orders

makes	
these

More

have	
found	
no

Internal

as	
a	
distended	
bladder

external

In

a	
past

current	
history

it

Familial

Genetic	
factors

to	
play	
an	
important	
role	
in	
all	
of	
the	
disorders

However	
,	
published

Sleepwalking	DISEASE
has	
a	
familial	
pattern

The	
rate	
of	
childhood	
sleepwalking	
increases	
in	
relation	
to	
the	
number	
of	
affected	
parents

22

Population	
-	
based	
studies	
of	
monozygotic

that	
genetic

and	
Complications	
Confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
most	
often	
appear	
in	
early	
childhood	
around	
the	
age	
of	
two	
years	
.	

This	
childhood	
form	
of	
confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
is	
typically	
benign

may	
cause	
concern	
in

Confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
of	
early	
childhood	
diminish	
in	
occurrence

Sleepwalking	
can	
begin	
as	
soon	
as	
a	
child	
is	
able	
to

almost	
any

Sleepwalking	DISEASE
is	
often	
preceded	
by	
confusional	DISEASE

Childhood	
sleepwalking	
usually	
disappears	
sponta-	
neously	
around	
puberty	
but	
may	
persist	
into	
adolescence

Episodes	
can	
occur	
sporad-

or	
with	
high	
frequency	
,	
such	
as	
multiple	
times	
nightly	
for	
several	
consecutive	
nights

Sleepwalking	
may	
occur	
for	
the	
first	
time	
in

or	
may	
recur	
in	
adult-

during	
periods

terrors	DISEASE
can	
impair	
social	
relationships	
in	
children	
and	
adults	
.	

Serious	
or	
even	
lethal	
injuries	DISEASE
can	
occur	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
noted	
above	
,	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
most	
often	
occur	
initially	
in	
childhood	
and	
decrease	
in	
occurrence	
steadily	
until	
young	
adulthood	
.	

However	
,	
they	
may	
occur	
for	
the	
first	
time	
in	
adulthood	
or	
reappear	
after	
many	
asymptomatic	
years	
,	
often	
related	
to	
stress	
,	
sleep	
deprivation	
,	
or	
development	
of	
another	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
overwhelming	
majority	
of	
individuals	
with	
disorders	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
do	
not	
have	
neuro-	
logical	
or	
psychological	
pathology	
.	

There	
are	
rare	
reported	
cases	
of	
confusional	DISEASE
arous-	DISEASE
als	
associated	
with	
brain	DISEASE
lesions	DISEASE
in	
areas	
subserving	
arousal	
,	
such	
as	
the	
posterior	
hypothalamus	
,	
midbrain	
reticular	
area	
,	
and	
periventricular	
gray	
matter	
.	

However	
,	
data	
from	
a	
single	
patient	
with	
confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
suggest	
that	
they	
may	
be	
due	
to	
a	
func-	
tional	
abnormality	
in	
the	
brain	
that	
leaves	
some	
regions	
,	
such	
as	
hippocampus	
and	
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
frontal	
associative	
cortices	
,	
asleep	
,	
while	
other	
parts	
of	
the	
brain	
such	
as	
motor	
,	
cingu-	
late	
,	
insular	
,	
amygdala	
,	
and	
temporopolar	
cortices	
,	
are	
active	
or	
awake	
.	

It	
is	
generally	
considered	
that	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
represent	
a	
dissociation	
of	
different	
regions	
of	
the	
brain	
in	
addition	
to	
activation	
of	
locomotor	
centers	
/	
central	
pattern	

gen-	
erators	
,	
accompanied	
by	
sleep	DISEASE
inertia	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
state	DISEASE
instability	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	

Although	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
for	
the	
evaluation	
of	
typical	
,	
uncomplicated	
,	
and	
non-	
injurious	
parasomnias	DISEASE
,	
polysomnographic	
studies	
demonstrate	
that	
disorders	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
typically	DISEASE
begin	
after	
an	
arousal	
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
,	
most	
commonly	
toward	
the	
end	
of	
the	
first	
or	
second	
episode	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

Occasionally	
,	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
can	
emerge	
from	
stage	
N2	
sleep	
.	

Heart	
rate	
acceleration	
,	
increased	
muscle	
tone	
,	
and	
muscle	DISEASE
twitching	DISEASE
may	
rarely	
be	
observed	
before	
a	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
arousal	
.	

Diagnostic	
polysomnography	
may	
note	
high	
-	
amplitude	
hypersynchronous	
delta	
waves	
and	
frequent	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
these	
findings	
have	
a	
low	
spec-	
ificity	
and	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
occur	
in	
other	
disorders	
such	
as	
OSA	DISEASE
and	
in	
asymp-	
tomatic	
individuals	
.	

On	
rare	
occasions	
,	
polysomnography	
can	
provide	
support	
for	
the	
clinical	
diagnosis	
by	
documenting	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
accompanied	
by	
behaviors	
typical	
of	
confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
.	

Out	
-	
of	
-	
bed	
behaviors	
are	
very	
rare	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
.	

Changes	
between	
the	
home	
and	
sleep	
laboratory	
environment	
,	
timing	
,	
habits	
,	
and	
other	
factors	
may	
serve	
to	
decrease	
the	
likelihood	
of	
sleepwalking	
in	
the	
laboratory	
.	

Time	
-	
synchronized	
video	
-	
polysomnographic	
(	
vPSG	
)	
recording	
is	
essen-	
tial	
if	
polysomnography	
(	
PSG	
)	
is	
to	
be	
used	
as	
support	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

However	
,	
a	
normal	
PSG	
does	
not	
rule	
out	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
.	

In	
adults	
in	
whom	
there	
are	
only	
one	
or	
two	
episodes	
per	
year	
,	
there	
is	
a	
very	
low	
likelihood	
of	
occurrence	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
.	

However	
,	
the	
sleep	
study	
may	
assist	
in	
ruling	
out	
disorders	
with	
similar	
presentations	
,	
such	
as	
RBD	DISEASE
or	
nocturnal	DISEASE
epilepsy	DISEASE
.	

PSG	
may	
further	
be	
useful	
by	
identifying	
potential	
triggers	
,	
such	
as	
sleep	
related	
breathing	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
or	
peri-	DISEASE
odic	DISEASE
leg	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
that	
are	
currently	
present	
.	

Provocative	
sleep	
studies	
using	
sleep	
deprivation	
and	
acoustic	
stimuli	
have	
been	
used	
for	
research	
purposes	
,	
with	
success	
.	

However	
,	
the	
sensitivity	
and	
specificity	
of	
these	
techniques	
for	
clinical	
purposes	
are	
unknown	
.

PSG	
also	
may	
be	
helpful	
in	
excluding	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
by	
demonstration	
of	
normal	
muscle	DISEASE
atonia	DISEASE
in	
REM	
sleep	
(	
assuming	
adequate	
amounts	
of	
REM	
sleep	
are	
observed	
)	
.	

Although	
the	
“	
macrostructure	
”	
of	
sleep	
(	
i.e.	
,	
the	
cycling	
of	
various	
NREM	
and	
REM	
sleep	
stages	
and	
the	
relative	
distributions	
of	
these	
sleep	
stages	
)	
is	
generally	
preserved	
with	
sleepwalking	
,	
the	
“	
microstructure	
”	
of	
sleep	
can	
be	
perturbed	
.	

Power	
spectral	
analyses	
of	
slow	
wave	
activity	
in	
adult	
sleepwalkers	
have	
revealed	
several	
forms	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
dysregulation	
,	
including	
high	
amounts	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
fragmentation	
(	
particularly	
during	
the	
first	
NREM	
-	
REM	
sleep	
cycle	
)	
,	
a	
significant	
increase	
in	
delta	
power	
just	
prior	
to	
an	
arousal	
,	
and	
increased	
slow	
wave	
activity	
across	
all	
NREM	
sleep	
cycles	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
should	
be	
carefully	
distinguished	
from	
other	
disorders	
with	
similar	
presentations	
,	
but	
different	DISEASE
pathophysiologies	DISEASE
,	
courses	
,	
and	
treatments	
.	

Other	
disorders	
to	
be	
considered	
include	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	DISEASE
,	
sleep	
related	
dissocia-	DISEASE
tive	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
and	
drug	
related	
behaviors	
,	
and	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

RBD	DISEASE
typically	
presents	
as	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
during	
the	
second	
half	
of	
the	
night	
and	
usually	
affects	
middle	
-	
aged	
men	
,	
but	
also	
can	
affect	
women	
and	
virtually	
any	
age	
group	
.	

Because	
sleepwalking	
in	
adults	
can	
also	
present	
as	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
that	
emerge	
during	
any	
time	
of	
the	
night	
,	
vPSG	
may	
be	
necessary	
to	
distinguish	
sleep-	
walking	
from	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
signs	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
particularly	
tonic	
/	
phasic	
EMG	
activity	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
are	
almost	
always	
present	
during	
sleep	
studies	
.	

If	
sleepwalking	
(	
or	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
)	
occurs	
with	
RBD	DISEASE
in	
the	
same	
patient	
,	
both	
should	
be	
diagnosed	
.	

This	
has	
been	
referred	
to	
as	
a	
parasomnia	DISEASE
overlap	
disorder	
.	

Other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
such	
as	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
can	
precipitate	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Therefore	
,	
a	
careful	
history	
must	
be	
obtained	
to	
identify	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
related	
epilepsy	DISEASE
can	
manifest	
with	
wandering	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
or	
with	
frenzied	
walking	
or	
running	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
malingering	
also	
should	
be	
considered	
.	

If	
a	
neurologic	
or	
medical	
disor-	
der	DISEASE
is	
identified	
as	
the	
precipitant	
of	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
,	
then	
the	
sleepwalking	
should	
be	
diagnosed	
as	
parasomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medical	
disorder	
.	

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
should	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
in	
the	
presence	
of	
alcohol	DISEASE
intoxication	DISEASE
.	

The	
behavior	
of	
the	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
-	
intoxicated	
individual	
may	
superficially	
resemble	
that	
of	
the	
sleepwalker	
.	

However	
,	
the	
sleepwalker	
is	
typically	
severely	
cognitively	
impaired	
,	
but	
with	
only	
limited	
motor	
impairment	
.	

The	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
-	
intoxicated	
individual	
’s	
level	
of	
cognitive	
functioning	
may	
be	
reduced	
,	
but	
not	
absent	
,	
whereas	
motor	
behavior	
is	
often	
severely	
impaired	
.	

In	
alcoholic	DISEASE
blackouts	DISEASE
,	
where	
anterograde	
amnesia	DISEASE
is	
,	
by	
definition	
,	
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
the	
cardinal	
manifestation	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
note	
that	
outward	
motor	
behavior	
and	
cog-	
nitive	
function	
may	
not	
be	
impaired	
and	
may	
be	
perceived	
as	
normal	
.	

Thus	
,	
the	
impor-	
tance	
of	
appreciating	
the	
neuroscience	
of	
alcoholic	DISEASE
blackouts	DISEASE
and	
its	
potential	
role	
in	
the	
explanation	
of	
unusual	
and	
bizarre	
nocturnal	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
can	
not	
be	
understated	
because	
these	
can	
mimic	
parasomnias	DISEASE
.	

The	
former	
are	
exponentially	
more	
prevalent	
and	
thus	
should	
be	
given	
appropriate	
weight	
when	
attributing	
likely	
causation	
in	
cases	
with	
criminal	
allegations	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
With	
the	
development	
of	
sophisticated	
genetic	
testing	
and	
neuroimaging	
,	
direct	
research	
into	
the	
causes	
and	
mechanisms	
of	
disorders	
or	
arousals	DISEASE
is	
anticipated	
.	

Further	
investigations	
that	
aid	
in	
the	
characterization	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
are	
necessary	
.	

Further	
development	
of	
sleep	
laboratory	
-	
based	
techniques	
for	
provoking	
episodes	
of	
sleepwalking	
would	
improve	
diagnostic	
accuracy

Essential	
Features	
SRED	
consists	
of	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
involuntary	
eating	
and	
drinking	
during	
arous-	
als	
from	
sleep	
,	
associated	
with	
diminished	
levels	
of	
consciousness	
and	
subsequent	
recall	
,	
with	
problematic	
consequences	
.	

The	
episodes	
of	
eating	
always	
occur	
in	
an	
involuntary	
or	
“	
out	
of	
control	
”	
manner	
after	
an	
interval	
of	
sleep	
.	

Typically	
,	
they	
occur	
during	
partial	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
sleep	
with	
subsequent	
partial	
recall	
.	

On	
the	
one	
hand	
,	
some	
patients	
can	
not	
be	
easily	
brought	
to	
full	
consciousness	
during	
an	
episode	
of	
eating	
,	
as	
is	
the	
case	
with	
sleepwalking	
,	
and	
may	
have	
no	
recall	
of	
having	
eaten	
during	
the	
night	
.	

On	
the	
other	
hand	
,	
some	
patients	
seemingly	
have	
considerable	
alertness	DISEASE
during	
an	
episode	
and	
have	
substantial	
recall	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

There	
may	
be	
variability	
of	
awareness	
and	
subsequent	
recall	
within	
one	
night	
,	
and	
across	
the	
evolution	
of	
the	
disorder	
in	
individual	
patients	
.	

The	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
involuntary	
eating	
and	
drinking	
during	
the	
main	
sleep	
period	
are	
typically	
associated	
with	
a	
feeling	
of	
lack	
of	
control	
over	
eating	
.	

Problematic	
features	
of	
the	
recurrent	
sleep	
related	
eating	
include	
the	
following	
:	
con-	
sumption	
of	
peculiar	
forms	
or	
combinations	
of	
food	
,	
or	
of	
inedible	
or	
toxic	
substances	
(	
e.g.	
,	
frozen	
pizzas	
,	
raw	
bacon	
,	
buttered	
cigarettes	
,	
cat	
food	
and	
salt	
sandwiches	
,	
coffee	
grounds	
,	
ammonia	CHEMICAL
cleaning	
solutions	
)	
;	
sleep	
related	
injury	
(	
e.g.	
,	
lacerations	
from	
care-	
less	
manipulation	
of	
kitchen	
utensils	
;	
internal	
or	
external	
burns	DISEASE
from	
consuming	
or	
spilling	
hot	
foods	
or	
beverages	
;	
or	
poisoning	DISEASE
and	
internal	
injuries	DISEASE
from	
ingesting	
toxic	
substances	
)	
;	
adverse	
health	
consequences	
(	
e.g.	
,	
dental	
caries	DISEASE
and	
tooth	
chipping	
from	
biting	
frozen	
foods	
)	
;	
weight	DISEASE
gain	DISEASE
;	
obesity	DISEASE
(	
including	
morbid	
obesity	DISEASE
resulting	
in	
bar-	
iatric	
surgery	
)	
;	
various	
metabolic	
problems	
,	
such	
as	
destabilization	
or	
precipitation	
of	
diabetes	DISEASE

,	
hypertriglyceridemia	DISEASE
,	
and	
hypercholesterolemia	DISEASE
;	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
from	
sleep	
disruption	
;	
morning	DISEASE
anorexia	DISEASE
and	
abdominal	DISEASE
distention	DISEASE
.	

SRED	
carries	
the	
risk	
of	
consuming	
foods	
to	
which	
one	
is	
allergic	DISEASE
.	

Also	
,	
overnight	
fasting	
prior	
to	
next	
-	
day	
surgery	
or	
testing	
can	
be	
compromised	
.	

Secondary	DISEASE
depressive	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
may	
emerge	
from	
longstanding	
personal	
dejection	
and	
a	
sense	
of	
failure	
over	
the	
inability	
to	
control	
the	
nocturnal	
eating	
.	

Secondary	
food	
restriction	
,	
prompted	
by	
despair	
over	
not	
being	
able	
to	
stop	
the	
nocturnal	
eating	
,	
often	
occurs	
at	
some	
point	
during	
the	
course	
of	
the	
disorder	
.	

Patients	
may	
engage	
in	
potentially	
hazardous	
(	
and	
expensive	
)	
weight	
-	
loss	
regimens	
.	

Insomnia	DISEASE
can	
also	
be	
a	
complication	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Nightly	
eating	
,	
including	
multiple	
episodes	
nightly	
,	
is	
reported	
by	
a	
majority	
of	
affected	
individuals	
.	

The	
episodes	
of	
eating	
occur	
during	
any	
time	
in	
the	
sleep	
cycle	
.	

High	
-	
caloric	
foods	
are	
typically	
preferred	
.	

The	
foods	
preferentially	
consumed	
during	
sleep	
related	
eating	
are	
not	
typically	
consumed	
with	
preference	
during	
the	
daytime	
.	

Paradoxically	
,	
to	
the	
extent	
that	
there	
is	
recall	
,	
hunger	
and	
thirst	DISEASE
are	
notably	
absent	
during	
episodes	
of	
compulsive	
eating	
with	
SRED	
.	

The	
episodes	
of	
eating	
are	
some-	
times	
experienced	
as	
food	
-	
related	
enactment	
of	
a	
dream	
.	

Simple	
foods	
or	
entire	
hot	
or	
cold	
meals	
may	
be	
prepared	
and	
consumed	
.	

Careless	
food	
handling	
often	
occurs	
.	

Alcoholic	
beverages	
are	
almost	
never	
consumed	
.	

The	
usual	
response	
to	
interference	
during	
an	
eating	
episode	
is	
irritability	DISEASE
and	
agitation	DISEASE
.

Demographics	
The	
following	
rates	
of	
SRED	
,	
as	
determined	
by	
self	
-	
administered	
questionnaire	
,	
have	
been	
reported	
:	
16.7	
%	
in	
an	
inpatient	DISEASE

disorders	DISEASE
group	
;	
8.7	
%	
in	
an	
outpatient	
eating	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
group	
;	
and	
4.6	
%	
in	
an	
unselected	
university	
student	
group	
.	

This	
study	
would	
indicate	
a	
high	
prevalence	
of	
SRED	
,	
although	
confirmatory	
studies	
across	
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
different	
clinical	
and	
nonclinical	
population	
groups	
are	
needed	
.	

Females	
comprise	
60	
%	
to	
83	
%	
of	
patients	
in	
reported	
series	
.	

Mean	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
SRED	DISEASE
is	
reported	
to	
be	
22	
-	
39	
years	
.	

In	
the	
reported	
series	
,	
the	
mean	
duration	
of	
SRED	
prior	
to	
clinical	
presen-	
tation	
ranged	
from	
four	
to	
15	
years	
,	
suggesting	
that	
SRED	
often	
is	
a	
chronic	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
SRED	
can	
be	
idiopathic	DISEASE
,	
but	
it	
appears	
to	
be	
most	
commonly	
associated	
with	
a	
primary	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
another	
clinical	
condition	
,	
or	
use	
of	
a	
sedative	
-	
hypnotic	
medication	
.	

Sleepwalking	DISEASE
is	
the	
most	
common	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
associated	
with	
sleep	
related	
eating	
,	
although	
once	
eating	
becomes	
part	
of	
the	
behavioral	
repertoire	
,	
it	
quickly	
becomes	
the	
predominant	
,	
if	
not	
the	
exclusive	
,	
nocturnal	
“	
sleepwalking	
”	
behavior	
.	

This	
would	
indi-	
cate	
that	
SRED	
is	
most	
often	
a	
“	
sleepwalking	DISEASE
variant	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	
”	

A	
history	
of	
sleepwalk-	CHEMICAL
ing	
during	
childhood	
appears	
to	
be	
a	
predisposing	
factor	
in	
many	
cases	
.	

A	
recent	
retro-	
spective	
controlled	
study	
of	
SRED	DISEASE
patients	
,	
sleepwalking	
patients	
,	
and	
controls	
found	
that	
SRED	DISEASE
patients	
were	
mainly	
women	
with	
onset	
of	
the	
disturbance	
in	
adulthood	
.	

They	
typically	
experienced	
nightly	
episodes	
and	
had	
more	
frequent	
eating	
problems	
in	
childhood	
and	
higher	
current	
anorexia	DISEASE
scores	
than	
sleepwalking	
patients	
or	
controls	
.	

They	
also	
shared	
commonalities	
with	
sleepwalking	DISEASE
patients	
,	
including	
a	
high	
(	
66	
%	
)	
frequency	
of	
past	
or	
current	
sleepwalking	
,	
a	
similar	
timing	
of	
parasomnia	DISEASE
episodes	
(	
in	
the	
first	
half	
of	
the	
night	
)	
,	
and	
numerous	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
stage	
N3	
.	

On	
video	
-	
polysom-	
nography	
,	
eating	
episodes	
occurred	
mostly	
within	
one	
minute	
after	
awakening	
from	
stage	
N2	
or	
N3	
.	

The	
frequencies	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
PLMs	
,	
and	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
were	
similar	
across	
the	
three	
groups	
.	

Other	
sleep	DISEASE

that	
can	
be	
closely	
associated	
with	
SRED

OSA	DISEASE
,	
and	
circadian

Multiple	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
in	
the	
same	
patient	
have	
been	
reported	
with	
SRED	
,	
including	
sexsomnia	
and	
a	
variant	
of	
confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
and	
sleepwalking	
.	

Medication

SRED	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
with	
zolpidem	CHEMICAL
,	
in	
particular	
,	
but	
also

Onset	
of

also	
has	
been	
reported	
with	
cessation

and	
with

In	
a

study	
of	
65	
patients	
with

cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
32	
%

had	
previously	
been	
identified	
when	
nocturnal

was	
first	
reported	
in	
2008	
)	
.	

A	
study	
of	
88	
patients	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
42	
patients	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
who	
were	
systematically	
questioned	
for	
the	
presence	
of	
SRED	
or	
other	
nocturnal	
eating	
demonstrated	
that	
36	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
versus	
zero	
patients	
with	
insomnia	DISEASE
had	
SRED	
,	
and	
the	
very	
significant	
difference	
was	
not	
related	
to	
arousal	
frequency	
.	

In	
that	
study	
,	
patients	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
who	
were	
taking	
hypnotic	
medications	
were	
at	
additional	
risk	
for	
SRED	
.	

Familial	
Pattern	
A	
familial	
basis	
for	
SRED	
is	
not	
uncommon	
,	
including	
co	
-	
occurrence	
in	
fraternal	
twins	
,	
although	
detailed	
genetic	
studies	
have	
not	
been	
carried	
out	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
onset	
of	
SRED	
can	
be	
insidious	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
sporadic	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
it	DISEASE
can	
be	
precipitous	
and	
fulmi-	
nant	
with	
rapid	
development	
of	
nightly	
episodes	
of	
eating	
,	
related	
or	
unrelated	
to	
the	
start	
of	
hypnotic	
medication	
therapy	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

The	
course	
is	
usually	
unremitting	
.	

Fires	
can	
occur	
when	
the	
individual	
with	
SRED	
begins	
to	
cook	
foods	
on	
the	
stove	
or	
in	
the	
oven	
,	
and	
then	
abandons	
them	
.	

A	
variety	
of	
other	
complications	
have	
been	
described	
previously	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
SRED	
can	
emerge	
in	
childhood	
,	
either	
associated	
or	
unassociated	
with	
a	
family	
history	
of	
SRED	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
SRED	DISEASE
is	
unclear	
.	

Despite	
the	
broad	
range	
of	
pre-	
disposing	
and	
precipitating	
factors	
in	
SRED	
,	
the	
relatively	
homogeneous	
set	
of	
clinical	
features	
suggests	
the	
presence	
of	
a	
“	
final	
common	
pathway	
”	
that	
can	
be	
accessed	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
factors	
.	

Although	
SRED	DISEASE
has	
prominent	
features	
of	
both	
a	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
and	
an	
eating	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
its	
relatively	
homogeneous	
presentation	
supports	
its	
classification	
as	
a	
separate	
diagnostic	
entity	
.	

More	
than	
half	
of	
patients	
with	
SRED	DISEASE
have	
a	
history	
of	
another	
parasomnia	DISEASE
that	
preceded	
the	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
eating	
,	
suggesting	
that	
the	
presence	
of	
another	
parasomnia	DISEASE
is	
a	
major	
risk	
factor	
for	
SRED	
.	

However	
,	
the	
female	
predominance	
in	
SRED	
is	
more	
consistent	
with	
eating	DISEASE

with

disorders	
(	
RLS	DISEASE
/	
PLMD	DISEASE
)	
which	
have	
slight	
to	
no	
female	
bias	
.	

Thus	
it	
appears	
that	
two	
basic	
drive	
states	
—	
sleeping	
and	
eating	
—	
are	
pathologically	
intertwined	
in	
SRED	
.

Objective	
Findings	
Although	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
in	
the	
assessment	
of	
SRED	
,	
vPSG	
evaluations	
have	
often	
reported	
positive	
findings	
.	

The	
most	
common	
finding	
consists	
of	
multiple	
confu-	
sional	
arousals	DISEASE
,	
with	
or	
without	
eating	
,	
arising	
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
abnor-	DISEASE
mal	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
have	
been	
documented	
from	
all	
stages	
of	
NREM	
sleep	
and	
also	
occasion-	
ally	
from	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
level	
of	
consciousness	
has	
typically	
spanned	
the	
range	
from	
virtual	
unconsciousness	DISEASE
to	
various	
levels	
of	
partial	
consciousness	
despite	
a	
concurrent	
EEG	
pattern	
that	
is	
often	
predominantly	
awake	
,	
suggesting	
dissociation	
between	
the	
EEG	
and	
the	
level	
of	
consciousness	
.	

This	
dissociation	
also	
can	
be	
found	
in	
adult	
sleep-	
walking	
without	
associated	
eating	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
classic	
sleepwalking	
in	
childhood	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
the	
persistence	
of	
high	
-	
voltage	
delta	
waves	
or	
the	
admixture	
of	
delta	
,	
theta	
,	
and	
alpha	
activity	
.	

A	
predominant	
wake	
pattern	
is	
rare	
in	
childhood	
sleep-	
walking	
.	

PLMs	
and	
OSA	DISEASE
may	
be	
observed	
in	
polysomnographic	
monitoring	
of	
SRED	DISEASE
patients	
.	

In	
one	
recent	
study	
that	
addressed	
the	
boundaries	
between	
SRED	
and	
fully	
conscious	
abnormal	
nocturnal	
eating	
,	
22	
of	
35	
patients	
had	
PLMs	
,	
5	
of	
35	
had	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
and	
29	
of	
35	
had	
recurring	
chewing	
and	
swallowing	
movements	
during	
sleep	
that	
were	
associated	
with	
nearly	
half	
of	
the	
total	
number	
of	
EEG	
arousals	DISEASE
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
SRED	
must	
be	
distinguished	
primarily	
from	
night	
eating	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
(	
NES	
)	
,	
which	
is	
characterized	
by	
excessive	
eating	
between	
dinner	
and	
bedtime	
and	
during	
full	
awaken-	
ings	CHEMICAL
during	
the	
sleep	
period	
.	

In	
contrast	
to

(	
bulimia	DISEASE

,	
anorexia	DISEASE

)	
,	
inappropriate

such	
as

iting	
,	
enemas	CHEMICAL
,	
misuse	
of	
laxatives	
,	
diuretics	
,	
or	
other	
medications	
,	
or	
other	
purging	
activity	
,	
are	
not	
present	
in	
SRED	
,	
although	
the	
two	
conditions	
may	
be	
comorbid	DISEASE
.	

A	
person	
with	
a	
daytime	DISEASE
eating	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
may	
also	
have	
a	
coexisting	
SRED	
that	
is	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
but	
not	
associated	
with	
purging	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
during	
the	
night	
or	
upon	
arising	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

Patients	
with	
longstanding	
SRED	
and	
excessive	
weight	DISEASE
gain	DISEASE
may	
eventually	
fast	
during	
the	
daytime	
and/or	
engage	
in	
excessive	
exer-	
cise	
to	
prevent	
obesity	DISEASE
from	
the	
SRED	
.	

Likewise	
,	
patients	
who	
otherwise	
fulfill	
crite-	
ria	
for	
SRED	
may	
consciously	
eat	
during	
the	
prebedtime	
period	
in	
a	
futile	
attempt	
to	
suppress	
the	
compulsion	
to	
eat	
after	
subsequently	
falling	
asleep	
.	

SRED	
appears	
to	
be	
considerably	
more	
female	
predominant	
that	
NES	
(	
which	
has	
<	
60	
%	
female	
prevalence	
)	
,	
and	
mood	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
are	
more	
common	
with	
NES	
than	
with	
SRED	
.	

Nevertheless	
,	
SRED	
and	
NES	
share	
a	
considerable	
number	
of	
overlapping	
features	
and	
may	
exist	
along	
a	
common	
spectrum	
of	
pathophysiology	
.	

SRED	
should	
also	
be	
distinguished	
from	
nocturnal	
(	
sleep	
related	
)	
extensions	
of	
bulimia	DISEASE
nervosa	DISEASE
,

The	
nocturnal	
eating	
(	
drinking	
)	
syndrome	
described	
in	
the	
original	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
is	
primarily	
a	
disorder	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
infancy	DISEASE
that	
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent

the	
inability

can	
present	
with

of	
periodic

fulfilled	
by	
observation

during	
a	
single	
night

The	
observed	
vocalizations

behaviors	
often	
correlate	
with	
simultaneously	
occurring	
dream

leading	
to	
the

“

As	
defined	
by	
the	
guidelines	
for	
scoring	
PSG	
features	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
in	
the	
most	
recent	
version	
of	
the	
American	
Academy	
of	
Sleep	
Medicine	
(	
AASM	
)	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated	
Events	
.	
.	

Upon	
awakening	
,	
the	
individual	
is	
typically	
awake	
,	
alert	
,	
coherent	
,	
and	
oriented	
.	
.	

On	
occasion	
,	
there	
may	
be	
patients	
with	
a	
typical	
clinical	
history	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
with	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
,	
who	
also	
exhibit	
typical	
RBD	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
during	
vPSG

but	
do	
not	
demonstrate	
sufficient	
RWA	
,	
based	
on	
the	
current	
evidence	
-	
based	
data	
,	
to	
satisfy	
the	
PSG	
criteria	
for	
diagnosing	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

In	
such	
patients	
,	
RBD	DISEASE
may	
be	
provisionally	
diagnosed	
,	
based	
on	
clinical	
judgment	
.	

The	
same	
rule	
applies	
when	
vPSG	
is	
not	
readily	
available	
.	

6	
.	

Medications	
may	
unmask	
latent	
RBD	DISEASE
with	
preexisting	
RWA	
,	
according	
to	
current	
expert	
opinion	
.	

Therefore	
,	
medication	
-	
induced	
RBD	DISEASE
can	
be	
diagnosed	
as	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
using	
clinical	
judgment	
,	
pending	
future	
longitudinal	
studies	
.	

Essential	
Features	
RBD	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
abnormal	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
emerging	
during	
REM	
sleep	
that	
may	
cause	
injury	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
disruption	DISEASE
.	

RBD	DISEASE
is	
also	
associated	
with	
EMG	
abnormalities	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
EMG	
demonstrates	
an	
excess	
of	
muscle	
tone	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
and/or	
an	
excess	
of	
phasic	
EMG	
twitch	DISEASE
activity	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

A	
complaint	
of	
sleep	
related	
injury	
is	
common	
with	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
which	
usually	
manifests	
as	
an	
attempted	
enactment	
of	
unpleasant	
,	
action	
-	
filled	
,	
and	
violent	
dreams	
in	
which	
the	
individual	
is	
being	
confronted	
,	
attacked	
,	
or	
chased	
by	
unfamiliar	
people	
or	
animals	
.	

Typically	
,	
at	
the	
end	
of	
an	
episode	
,	
the	
individual	
awakens	
quickly	
,	
becomes	
rapidly	
alert	
,	
and	
reports	
a	
dream	
with	
a	
coherent	
story	
.	

The	
dream	
action	
corresponds	
closely	
to	
the	
observed	
sleep	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
and	
dream	
-	
related	
behaviors	
reported	
by	
history	
and	
documented	
during	
vPSG	
include	
both	
violent	DISEASE
and	
(	
less	
commonly	
)	
nonviolent	
behaviors	
:	
talking	
(	
including	
giving	
speeches	
)	
,	
smiling	
,	
laughing	
,	
singing	
,	
whistling	
,	
shouting	
,	
swearing	
profan-	
ities	
,	
crying	
,	
chewing	
,	
gesturing	
,	
reaching	
,

flailing	
,	
clapping	
,	
slap-

,	
punching	
,	
kicking	
,	
sitting	
up	
,	
leaping	
from	
bed	
,	
crawling	
,	
running	
,	
or	
dancing	
.	

Walking	
,	
however	
,	
is	
quite	
uncommon	
with	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
and	
leaving	
the	
room	
is	
especially	
rare	
,	
because	
the	
eyes	
are	
usually	
closed	
,	
precluding	
attention	
to	
the	
environment	
.	

There	
can	
be	
rare	
occurrences	
of	
smoking	
a	
fictive	
cigarette	
,	
masturbation	
-	
like	
behav-	
ior	
,	
pelvic	
thrusting	
,	
and	
mimics	
of	
eating	
,	
drinking	
,	
urinating	
,	
and	
defecating	
.	

The	
eyes	
usually	
remain	
closed	
during	
an	
RBD	DISEASE
episode	
,	
with	
the	
person	
attending	
to	
the	
dream	
action	
and	
not	
to	
the	
actual	
environment	
.	

Medical	
attention	
is	
usually	
sought	
after	
sleep	
related	
injury	
has	
occurred	
to	
either	
the	
person	
or	
the	
bed	
partner	
,	
and	
rarely	
because	
of	
sleep	
disruption	
.	

Because	
RBD	DISEASE
occurs	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
it	
usually	
appears	
at	
least	
90	
minutes	
after	
sleep	
onset	
,	
unless	
there	
is	
coexisting	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
in	
which	
case	
RBD	DISEASE
can	
emerge	
shortly	
after	
sleep	
onset	
during	
a	
sleep	
onset	
rapid	
eye	
movement	
period	
(	
SOREMP	DISEASE
)	
.	

There	
is	
an	
acute	
form	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
that	
emerges	
during	
intense	
REM	
sleep	
rebound	
states	
,	
such	
as	
during	
withdrawal	
from	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
and	
sedative	
-	
hypnotic	
agents	
,	
or	
in	
association	
with	
certain	
medication	
use	
,	
drug	
intoxication	
,	
or	
relapsing	
multiple	DISEASE
sclerosis	DISEASE
.	

Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Associated	
Features	
PLMs	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
are	
very	
common	
with	
RBD	DISEASE
and	
may	
disturb	
the	
sleep	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
.	

Daytime	DISEASE
tiredness	DISEASE
or	
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
uncommon	
,	
unless	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
is	
also	
present	
.	

There	
is	
typically	
no	
history	
of	
irritable	DISEASE
,	
aggressive	
,	
or	
violent	
behav-	
ior	
during	
the	
day	
.	

There	
may	
be	
a	
longstanding

history	
of

disorder	
is	
a	
condition	
in	
which	
patients	
have	
both	
RBD	DISEASE

either	
a

,

disorder	DISEASE
,	
sexsomnia	
,	
or

.	

This	
condition	
is	
male	
predominant	
,	
but	
less	
so	
than	
isolated	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

Most	
cases	
begin	
during	
childhood	
or	
adolescence	
.	

Virtually	
all	
age	
groups	
can	
be	
affected	
.	

It	
can	
be	
idiopathic	DISEASE

of	
a

Status	DISEASE
dissociatus	DISEASE
can	
be	
classified	
as	
a	
subtype	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
that	
manifests	
as	
an	
extreme	
form	
of	
state	
dissociation	
without	
identifiable	
sleep	
stages	
,	
but	
with	
sleep	
and	
dream	
-	
related	
behaviors	
that	
closely	
resemble	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

Status	DISEASE
dissociatus	DISEASE
represents	
a	
major	
breakdown	
of	
the	
polysomnographic	
markers	
for	
REM	
sleep	
,	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
and	
wakefulness	
,	
with	
admixtures	
of	
these	
states	
being	
present	
,	
but	
with	
conventional	
sleep	
stages	
not	
being	
identifiable	
during	
polysomnographic	
monitoring	
.	

There	
is	
abnormal	
behavioral	
release	
that	
can	
be	
associated	
with	
disturbed	
dreaming	
,	
strongly	
suggestive	
of	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
that	
closely	
resemble	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

Not	
uncommonly	
,	
the	
indi-	
vidual	
thinks	
he	
is	
awake	
when	
observers	
presume	
he	
is	
asleep	
and	
attempting	
to	
act	
out	
a	
dream	
,	
or	
vice	
versa	
.	

An	
underlying	
neurologic	
or	
medical	
condition	
,	
spanning	
a	
broad	
range	
of	
pathology	
,	
is	
virtually	
always	
present	
.	

Dream	
enactment	
(	
“	
oneirism	
”	
)	
that	
is	
REM	
sleep	
related	
or	
related	
to	
a	
dissociated	
REM	
sleep	
-	
wakefulness	
state	
can	
be	
a	
core	
feature	
of	
a	
pathologic	
condition	
called	
agrypnia	DISEASE
excitata	DISEASE
that	
is	
characterized	
by	
generalized	
motor	DISEASE
overactivity	DISEASE
,	
impaired	
ability	
to	
initiate	
and	
maintain	
sleep	
(	
with	
“	
wakeful	
dreaming	
”	
)	
,	
loss	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
,	
and	
marked	
motor	
and	
autonomic	
sympathetic	
activation	
.	

Agrypnia	
excitata	DISEASE
is	
found	
with	
such	
diverse	
conditions	
as	
delirium	DISEASE
tremens	DISEASE
,	
Morvan	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
and	
fatal	
familial	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Thus	
,	
agrypnia	DISEASE
excitata	DISEASE
manifests	
as	
both	
a	
severe	
parasomnia	DISEASE
and	
a	
severe	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Demographics	
RBD	DISEASE
is	
a	
male	
predominant	
disorder	
that	
usually	
emerges	
after	
age	
50	
years	
.	

Cases	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
from	
early	
childhood	
up	
to	
age	
88	
years	
have	
been	
reported	
.	

RBD	DISEASE
emerging	
in	
adults	
before	
age	
50	
years	
tends	
to	
have	
different	
demographics	
and	
associated	
features	
,	
including	
greater	
sex	
parity	
and	
increased	
rates	
of	
idiopathic	DISEASE
RBD	DISEASE
and	
para-	
somnia	DISEASE
overlap	
disorder	
(	
POD	
)	
,	
comorbid	DISEASE
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
medication	
use	
,	
and	
possibly	
autoimmune	DISEASE
diseases	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
clinical	
presentation	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
in	
younger	
adults	
differs	
from	
that	
in	
older	
adults	
in	
being	
less	
aggressive	
and	
violent	
,	
presumably	
due	
to	
greater	
female	
representation	
and	
higher	
rates	
of	
comorbid	
narco-	
lepsy	
(	
which	
manifests	
with	
milder	
RBD	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
)	
.	

RBD	DISEASE
associated	
with	
neurologic	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
and	
other	
symptomatic	
forms	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
are	
as	
male	
predominant	
as	
idiopathic	DISEASE
RBD	DISEASE
,	
with	
the	
exception	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
(	
as	
described	
below	
)	
and	
multiple	
system	
atrophy	DISEASE
.	

Of	
note	
,	
RBD	DISEASE
may	
not	
be	
the	
presenting	
com-	
plaint	
to	
a	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
center	
.	

Therefore	
,	
systematic	
questioning	
for	
RBD	DISEASE
should	
be	
included	
for	
all	
newly	
evaluated	
patients	
at	
a	
sleep	
center	
.	

RBD	DISEASE
in	
children	
is	
virtually	
never	
idiopathic	DISEASE
and	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
(	
at	
times	
emerging	
months	
before	
the	
emergence	
of	
narcoleptic	DISEASE
symptoms	DISEASE
)	
,	
brainstem	DISEASE
tumors	DISEASE
,	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
medications	
,	
neurodevelopmental	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
and	
various	
rare	
conditions	
.	

The	
prevalence	
is	
not	
known	
with	
much	
certainty	
,	
although	
a	
prevalence	
of	
0.38	
%	
to	
0.5	
%	
is	
reported	
in	
the	
elderly	
and	
the	
general	
population	
.	

A	
2.1	
%	
prevalence	
of	
current	
sleep	
related	
violence	
has	
been	
reported	
;	
38	
%	
of	
these	
events	
have	
associated	
dream	
enactment	
,	
suggesting	
a	
prevalence	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
as	
high	
as	
0.8	
%	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	

The	
major	
predisposing	
factors	
are	
male	
sex	
,	
age	
50	
years	
or	
older	
,	
and	
an	
under-	
lying	
neurological	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
particularly	
Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
multiple	
system	
atrophy	DISEASE
,	
dementia	DISEASE
with	
Lewy	DISEASE
bodies	
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
or	
stroke	DISEASE
.	

A	
recent	
multicenter	
case	
-	
control	
study	
of	
environmental	
risk	
factors	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
found	
that	
smoking	CHEMICAL
,	
head	DISEASE
injury	DISEASE
,	
pesticide	
exposure	
,	
and	
farming	
were	
significant	
risk	
factors	
.	

Medications	
,	
particularly	
the	
anti-	
depressants	
venlafaxine	CHEMICAL
,	
serotonin	CHEMICAL
-	
specific	
reuptake	
inhibitors	
(	
SSRIs	CHEMICAL
)	
,	
mirtazapine	CHEMICAL
,	
and	
other	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
agents	
(	
but	
not	
bupropion	CHEMICAL
)	
are	
an	
increasingly	
recognized	
precipitating	
factor	
.	

Beta	
-	
blockers	
(	
bisoprolol	CHEMICAL
,	
atenolol	CHEMICAL
)	
,	
anticholinesterase	
inhibitors	
,	
and	
selegiline	CHEMICAL
can	
also	
trigger	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

Psychiatric	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
involving	
depression	DISEASE
(	
that	
require	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
pharmacotherapy	
)	
may	
comprise	
a	
predisposing	
factor	
,	
particu-	
larly	
in	
adults	
younger	
than	
50	
years	
.	

RBD	DISEASE
may	
also	
be	
associated	
with	
posttraumatic	DISEASE
stress	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Familial	
Pattern	
A	
recent	
multicenter	
controlled	
study	
revealed	
a	
significantly	
increased	
positive	
family	
history	
of	
dream	
enactment	
,	
raising	
the	
possibility	
of	
a	
genetic	
contribution	
to	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
of	
chronic	
RBD	DISEASE
can	
be	
gradual	
or	
rapid	
,	
and	
the	
course	
is	
often	
progressive	
.	

Complications	
include	
sleep	
related	
injuries	DISEASE
to	
self	
and/or	
bed	
partner	
that	
at	
times	
are	
life	
threatening	
,	
and	
disruption	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
that	
can	
be	
severe	
.	

Marital	
discord	
due	
to	
the	
RBD	DISEASE
is	
uncommon	
but	
can	
be	
severe	
when	
present	
,	
due	
to	
repeated	
injury	
and/or	
disruption	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
.	

Delayed	
emergence	
of	
a	
neurodegenerative	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
often	
more	
than	
a	
decade	
after	
the	
onset	
of	
idiopathic	DISEASE
RBD	DISEASE
,	
is	
very	
common	
in	
men	
50	
years	
of	
age	
and	
older	
.	

These	
dis-	
orders	
include	
Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
(	
PD	DISEASE
)	
,	
multiple	
system	
atrophy	DISEASE
(	
MSA	CHEMICAL
)	
,	
and	
dementia	DISEASE
with	
Lewy	DISEASE
bodies	
(	
DLB	DISEASE
)	
.	

Two	
recently	
reported	
series	
found	
81	
%	
and	
82	
%	
eventual	
conversion	
rates	
from	
idiopathic	DISEASE
RBD	DISEASE
to	
parkinsonism	DISEASE
/	DISEASE
dementia	DISEASE
(	
and	
also	
mild	
cog-	
nitive	
impairment	
in	
the	
latter	
study	
)	
.	

Conversely	
,	
RBD	DISEASE
is	
present	
in	
>	
90	
%	
of	
reported	
cases	
of	
MSA	CHEMICAL
,	
in	
approximately	
50	
%	
of	
reported	
cases	
of	
DLB	DISEASE
,	
and	
in	
up	
to	
46	
%	
of	
reported	
patients	
with	
PD	DISEASE
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
stated	
previously	
,	
RBD	DISEASE
can	
emerge	
in	
children	
,	
usually	
in	
association	
with	
narco-	DISEASE
lepsy	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
cataplexy	DISEASE
,	
brainstem	DISEASE
tumors	DISEASE
,	
or	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
medications	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Current	
evidence	
suggests	
a	
selective	
association	
between	
RBD	DISEASE
and	
neurodegenera-	
tive	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

The	
synucleinopathies	DISEASE
comprise	
a	
set	
of	
neurodegenerative	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
that	
share	
a	
common	
pathologic	
lesion	
composed	
of	
aggregates	
of	
insoluble	
α	
-	
synu-	
clein	
protein	
in	
selectively	
vulnerable	
populations	
of	
neurons	
and	
glial	
cells	
.	

These	
pathologic	
aggregates	
appear	
to	
be	
closely	
linked	
to	
the	
onset	
and	
progression	
of	
clin-	
ical	
symptoms	
and	
the	
degeneration	
of	
affected	
brain	
regions	
in	
neurodegenerative	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

The	
major	DISEASE
synucleinopathies	DISEASE
include	
PD	DISEASE
,	
DLB	DISEASE
,	
and	
MSA	DISEASE
.	

RBD	DISEASE
can	
be	
strongly	
linked	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
(	
almost	
always	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
)	
,	
rep-	
resenting	
another	
form	
of	
REM	
sleep	
motor	
-	
behavioral	
dyscontrol	
.	

The	
RBD	DISEASE
may	
be	
precipitated	
or	
worsened	
by	
the	
pharmacologic	
treatment	
of	
cataplexy	DISEASE
.	

RBD	DISEASE
associ-	
ated	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
is	
now	
considered	
to	
be	
a	
distinct	
phenotype	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
character-	
ized	
by	
lack	
of	
sex	
predominance	
,	
less	
complex	
and	
more	
elementary	
movements	
in	
REM	
sleep	
,	
less	
violent	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
in	
REM	
sleep	
,	
earlier	
age	
of	
onset	
,	
and	
hypocretin	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
(	
that	
is	
characteristic	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
)	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
in	
pediat-	
ric	
patients	
may	
be	
an	
initial	
manifestation	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
type	
1	
.	

Other	
reported	
etiologic	
associations	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
with	
neurologic	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
include	
isch-	
emic	
or	
hemorrhagic	DISEASE
cerebrovascular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
multiple	DISEASE

,

The	
pathophysiology	
of	
human	
RBD	DISEASE
is	
presumed	
to	
correspond	
to	
the	
findings	
from	
an	
animal	
model	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
with	
respect	
to	
interruption	
of	
the	
REM	
atonia	DISEASE
pathway	
and/	
or	
disinhibition	
of	
brainstem	
motor	
pattern	
generators	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnography	
demonstrates	
an	
excessive	
amount	
of	
sustained	
or	
intermittent	
loss	
of	
REM	
atonia	DISEASE
and/or	
excessive	
phasic	
muscle	
twitch	
activity	
of	
the	
submental	
and/or	
limb	
EMGs	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Some	
patients	
have	
almost	
exclusively	
arm	
and	
hand	
behaviors	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
indicating	
the	
need	
for	
both	
upper	
and	
lower	
extremity	
EMG	
monitoring	
in	
fully	
evaluating	
for	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

Some	
patients	
preserve	
most	
of	
their	
REM	
atonia	DISEASE
but	
have	
excessive	
EMG	
twitching	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
most	
current	
evidence	
-	
based	
data	
for	
detecting	
RWA	
in	
the	
evaluation	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
indicate	
that	
any	
(	
tonic	
/	
phasic	
)	
chin	
EMG	
activity	
combined	
with	
bilateral	
phasic	
activity	
of	
the	
flexor	
digitorum	
superficialis	
muscles	
in	
>	
27	
%	
of	
REM	
sleep	
(	
scored	
in	
30	
-	
second	
epochs	
)	
reliably	
distinguishes	
RBD	DISEASE
patients	
from	
controls	
.	

Autonomic	
nervous	
system	
activa-	
tion	
(	
such	
as	
tachycardia	DISEASE
)	
is	
uncommon	
during	
REM	
sleep	
motor	
activation	
in	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
in	
contrast	
to	
the	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Approximately	
75	
%	
of	
patients	
have	
PLMs	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
;	
a	
low	
percentage	
of	
these	
movements	
is	
associated	
with	
EEG	
signs	
of	
arousal	
.	

Increased	
percentages	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
and	
increased	
delta	
power	
in	
RBD	DISEASE
have	
been	
found	
in	
controlled	
and	
uncontrolled	
studies	
,	
but	
this	
can	
be	
a	
highly	
vari-	
able	
finding	
in	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
depending	
on	
the	
clinical	
population	
.	

Sleep	
architecture	
and	
the	
customary	
cycling	
among	
REM	
and	
NREM	
sleep	
stages	
are	
usually	
preserved	
in	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
although	
some	
patients	
show	
a	
shift	
toward	
N1	
sleep	
.	

Validated	
RBD	DISEASE
screening	
questionnaires	
that	
can	
assist	
in	
the	
process	
of	
diagnosing	
RBD	DISEASE
are	
currently	
available

Differential	
Diagnosis	
RBD	DISEASE
is	
one	
of	
several

that	
can	
manifest	
as	
complex	
,	
injurious	
,	
and	
violent	
sleep	
related	
and	
dream

behaviors	
in

.	

Other

that	
can

;	
a	
diagnosis	
of

also	
should	
be	
considered	
.	

In	
general	
,	
RBD	DISEASE
involves	
attempted	
enactment	
of	
unpleasant

aggressive	
dreams	
that	
usually	
occurs	
two

more	
hours	
after

In	
contrast	
,	
sleepwalking

sleep	
terror	
episodes	
often	
emerge	
within	
two	
hours	
after	
sleep	
onset	
,	
are	
not	
usually	
associated	
with	
rapid	
alertness	
,	
and	
are	
rarely	
associated	
with

in	
children	
.	

Adults	
can	
have	
dreams	
associated	
with	
disor-	
ders	
of	
arousal	
,	
but	
they	
are	
usually	
more	
fragmentary	
and	
limited	
than	
RBD	DISEASE
dreams	
.	

Sleep

Parasomnia	DISEASE
overlap	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
status	DISEASE
dissociatus	DISEASE
in	
several	
ways	
:	
if	
there	
is	
an	
awakening	
after	
an	
episode	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
sleepwalking	
,	
or	
sleep	
terror	
,	
there	
is	
the	
realization	
of	
having	
just	
been	
asleep	
;	
status	DISEASE
dissociatus	DISEASE
,	
however	
,	
is	
more	
likely	
to	
manifest	
with	
confusion	DISEASE
over	
whether	
one	
is	
asleep	
,	
awake	
,	
or	
dreaming	
.	

vPSG

overlap	
conditions	
shows	
the	
typical	
findings	
for	
both	
RBD	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
whereas	DISEASE
with	DISEASE
status	DISEASE
dissociatus	DISEASE
,	
there	
is	
an	
inability	
to	
discern	
sleep	
stages	
.	

Also	
,	
patients	
with	
status	DISEASE
dissociatus	DISEASE
do	
not	
walk	
far	
during	
an	
episode	
,	
and	
their	
behavioral	
repertoire	
more	
closely	
resembles	
that	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
than	
that	
of	
the	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Future	
Directions	
Numerous	
questions	
related	
to	
the	
vPSG	
evaluation	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
remain	
unresolved	
.	

These	
include	
issues	
of	
defining	
and	
quantifying	
RWA	
and	
RBD	DISEASE
activity	
such	
as	
:	
(	
1	
)	
What	
is	
the	
minimum	
REM	
sleep	
percentage	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
(	
and	
minimum	
absolute	
REM	
sleep	
time	
)	
needed	
to	
diagnose	
RWA	
or	
rule	
out	
RWA	
?	

(	
2	
)	
What	
is	
the	
minimum	
number	
of	
REM	
sleep	
epochs	
and	
minimum	
duration	
of	
REM	
sleep	
epochs	
necessary	
to	
diagnose	
RWA	
or	
rule	
out	
RWA	
?	

(

)	
What	
guidelines	
can	
be	
developed	
for	
diag-	
nosing	
or	
ruling	
out	
RWA	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
disrupted	
REM	
sleep	
continuity	
associated	
with	
conditions	
such	
as	
obstructive	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
and	
with	
medications	
?	

(	
4	
)	
What	
are	
the	
minimal	
amounts	
of	
true	
RBD	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
documented	
by	
vPSG	
needed	
to	
identify	
RBD	DISEASE
in	
patients	
without	
sufficient	
RWA	
?	

It	
is	
unclear	
why	
there	
is	
a	
male	
predominance	
of	
this	
disorder	
in	
middle	
-	
aged	
and	
older	
adults	
.	

It	
is	
unknown	
if	
RBD	DISEASE
subgroups	
other	
than	
men	
age	
50	
years	
or	
older	
demon-	CHEMICAL
strate	
increased	
risk	
for	
development	
of	
parkinsonism	DISEASE
or	
dementia	DISEASE
.	

One	
such	
subgroup	
comprises	
patients	
with	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
-	
triggered	
RBD	DISEASE
for	
whom	
the	
potential	
risk	
for	
future	
parkinsonism	DISEASE
and	
dementia	DISEASE
is	
unclear	
.	

New	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
or	
other	
psychotro-	
pic	
agents	
being	
developed	
for	
clinical	
use	
should	
be

Essential	
Features	
Recurrent	
isolated	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
an	
inability	
to	
perform	
voluntary	
movements	
at	
sleep	
onset	
(	
hypnagogic	
or	
predormital	
form	
)	
or	
on	
waking	
from	
sleep	
(	
hypnopompic	DISEASE
or	
postdormital	
form	
)	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
.	

The	
event	
consists	
of	
an	
inability	
to	
speak	
or	
to	
move	
the	
limbs	
,	
trunk	
,	
and	
head	
.	

Respiration	
is	
usually	
unaffected	
.	

Consciousness	
is	
preserved	
,	
and	
full	
recall	
is	
present	
.	

An	
episode	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
lasts	
seconds	
to	
minutes	
.	

It	
usually	
resolves	
spontaneously	
but	
can	
be	
aborted	
by	
sensory	
stimulation	
,	
such	
as	
being	
touched	
or	
spoken	
to	
,	
or	
by	
the	
patient	
making	
intense	
efforts	
to	
move	
.	

Associated	
Features	
At	
least	
during	
the	
initial	
episodes	
,	
intense	
anxiety	DISEASE
is	
usually	
present	
.	

Hallucinatory	
experiences	
accompany	
the	
paralysis	DISEASE
in	
about	
25	
%	
to	
75	
%	
of	
patients	
.	

These	
may	
include	
auditory	
,	
visual	
,	
or	
tactile	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
,	
or	
the	
sense	
of	
a	
presence	
in	
the	
room	
.	

Some	
patients	
experience	
predormital	
or	
postdormital	
hallucinations	DISEASE
at	
separate	
times	
from	
episodes	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

Clinical	
or	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
A	
familial	
form	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
has	
been	
described	
(	
see	
below	
)	
.	

Demographics	
Estimates	
of	
the	
prevalence	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
vary	
widely	
due	
to	
differences	
in	
the	
definition	
used	
,	
the	
age	
of	
the	
population	
sampled	
,	
and	
possibly	
cultural	
and	
ethnic	
factors	
.	

Most	
prevalence	
studies	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
(	
usually	
of	
students	
younger	
than	
30	
years	
)	
have	
investigated	
the	
occurrence	
of	
one	
or	
more	
episodes	
without	
require-	
ment	
of	
recurrence	
or	
distress	
.	

These	
suggest	
a	
15	
%	
to	
40	
%	
prevalence	
of	
at	
least	
one	
episode	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

Two	
notable	
exceptions	
are	
a	
1962	
study	
of	
mostly	
college	
students	
that	
reported	
a	
prevalence	
of	
5	
%	
,	
and	
a	
1999	
study	
of	
all	
adult	
ages	
that	
found	
a	
prevalence	
of	
6	
%	
.	

No	
consistent	
sex	
differences	
have	
emerged	
from	
multiple	
studies	
.	

The	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
is	
14	
to	
17	
years	
,	
although	
onset	
earlier	
and	
later	
in	
life	
has	
been	
reported	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Sleep	
deprivation	
and	
irregular	
sleep	
-	
wake	
schedules	
have	
been	
identified	
as	
predis-	
posing	
factors	
to	
episodes	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

Mental	
stress	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
as	
a	
precipitating	
factor	
in	
some	
but	
not	
other	
studies	
.	

Sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
appears	
to	
be	
more	
common	
with	
sleep	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
.	

Personality	
factors	
have	
not	
been	
shown	
to	
play	
a	
major	
role	
,	
although	
one	
study	
found	
a	
higher	
score	
on	
the	
paranoia	
scale	
of	
the	
Minnesota	
Multiphasic	
Personality	
Inventory	
in	
patients	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
com-	
pared	
to	
controls	
.	

Other	
factors	
that	
have	
been	
noted	
on	
regression	
analysis	
include	
an	
association	
with	
bipolar	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
the	
use	
of	
anxiolytic	
medication	
,	
and	
sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
.	

Familial	
Pattern	
Two	
families	
with	
apparent	
familial	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
occurring	
over	
three	
and	
four	
gen-	
erations	
have	
been	
reported	
.	

A	
maternal	
form	
of	
transmission	
has	
been	
postulated	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
is	
usually	
in	
adolescence	
.	

Most	
events	
appear	
to	
occur	
in	
the	
second	
and	
third	
decades	
,	
but	
may	
continue	
later	
in	
life	
.	

There	
are	
no	
known	
complications	
,	
apart	
from	
anxiety	DISEASE
over	
the	
episodes	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Though	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
as	
part	
of	
the	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
tetrad	
in	
children	
,	
there	
is	
no	
information	
currently	
available	
about	
childhood	
presentation	
of	
recurrent	
isolated	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Episodes	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
elicited	
by	
awakening	
patients	
from	
nocturnal	
sleep	
appear	
to	
arise	
from	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
is	
an	
example	
of	
state	
dissociation	
with	
ele-	
ments	
of	
REM	
sleep	
persisting	
into	
wakefulness	
.	

Early	
-	
onset	
REM	
sleep	
after	
forced	
awakenings	DISEASE
has	
been	
shown	
to	
predispose	
an	
individual	
to	
having	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

It	
may	
be	
that	
subjects	
with	
less	
tolerance	
to	
sleep	
disruption	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
experi-	
ence	
the	
phenomenon	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Analysis	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
after	
forced	
awakenings	
during	
PSG	
studies	
reveals	
the	
event	
to	
be	
a	
dissociated	
state	
with	
the	
persistence	
of	
REM	
-	
related	
electromyographic	
atonia	DISEASE
into	
conscious	
wakefulness	
.	

Hallucinatory	
experiences	
may	
be	
present	
but	
are	
not	
essential	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Cataplexy	DISEASE
produces	
similar	
generalized	
paralysis	DISEASE
of	
skeletal	
muscles	
but	
occurs	
during	
wakefulness	
and	
is	
precipitated	
by	
emotion	
.	

Atonic	
seizures	DISEASE
occur	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Nocturnal	DISEASE
panic	DISEASE
attacks	DISEASE
are	
not	
usually	
associated	
with	
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

Familial	
periodic	
paralysis	DISEASE
syndromes	
,	
especially	
hypokalemic	DISEASE
periodic	
paralysis	DISEASE
,	
may	
occur	
at	
rest	
and	
on	
awakening	
.	

However	
,	
the	
episodes	
usually	
last	
hours	
,	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
car-	
bohydrate

Nightmare	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
in	
children	
is	
most	
likely	
to	
occur	
in	
those	
exposed	
to	
severe	
psychosocial	
stressors	
.	

Because	
childhood	
nightmares	
often	
resolve	
spontaneously	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
should	
be	
given	
only	
if	
there	
is	
persistent	
distress	
or	
impairment	
.	

Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Essential	
Features	
Nightmare	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent	
,	
highly	
dysphoric	DISEASE
dreams	DISEASE
,	
which	
are	
disturbing	
mental	
experiences	
that	
generally	
occur	
during	
REM	
sleep	
and	
that	
often	
result	
in	
awakening	
.	

Given	
that	
these	
experiences	
are	
most	
often	
associated	
with	
REM	
sleep	
,	
the	
episodes	
have	
a	
greater	
tendency	
to	
occur	
during	
the	
second	
half	
of	
the	
major	
sleep	
episode	
when	
the	
REM	
pressure	
is	
most	
pronounced	
.	

Nightmares	
involve	
an	
internally	
generated	
conscious	
experience	
or	
dream	
sequence	
that	
seems	
vivid	
and	
real	
.	

They	
have	
a	
tendency	
to	
become	
increasingly	
more	
disturbing	
as	
they	
unfold	
.	

Emotions	
are	
characteristically	
negative	
and	
most	
frequently	
involve	
anxiety	DISEASE
,	
fear	
,	
or	
terror	
but	
may	
also	
involve	
anger	DISEASE
,	
rage	
,	
embarrassment	
,	
and	
disgust	
.	

Nightmare	
content	
most	
often	
focuses	
on	
imminent	
physical	
danger	
to	
the	
individual	
but	
may	
also	
involve	
other	
distressing	
themes	
.	

Ability	
to	
detail	
the	
nightmare	
’s	
contents	
upon	
awakening	
is	
common	
in	
nightmare	
disorder	
.	

Multiple	
nightmares	
within	
a	
single	
sleep	
episode	
may	
occur	
and	
may	
bear	
similar	
themes	
.	

Because	
nightmares	
typically	
arise	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
they	
may	
occur	
at	
any	
moment	
that	
REM	
pressure	
is	
high	
.	

Nightmares	
are	
very	
common	
in	
children	
.	

They	
typically	
occur	
in	
the	
last	
third	
of	
the	
night	
and	
result	
in	
a	
complete	
awakening	
,	
after	
which	
the	
child	
can	
often	
provide	
a	
detailed	
description	
of	
the	
frightening	
scenario	
.	

However	
,	
clear	
distinction	
from	
con-	
fusional	
arousals	DISEASE
and	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
in	
young	
children	
is	
often	
not	
possible	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Postawakening	
anxiety	DISEASE
and	
difficulty	
returning	
to	
sleep	
may	
be	
present	
.	

Nightmares	
are	
more	
common	
in	
those	
with	
higher	
levels	
of	
anxiety	DISEASE
.	

Additionally	
,	
nightmares	
are	
commonly	
seen	
in	
those	
who	
have	
been	
physically	
or	
sexually	
abused	
and	
in	
those	
suf-	
fering	
from	
posttraumatic	DISEASE
stress	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Nightmares	
arising	
either	
immediately	
following	
a	
trauma	DISEASE
(	
acute	DISEASE
stress	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
[	
ASD	
]	
)	
or	
one	
month	
or	
more	
after	
a	
trauma	DISEASE
(	
posttraumatic	DISEASE
stress	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
[	
PTSD	DISEASE
]	
)	
have	
been	
described	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
especially	
N2	
,	
as	
well	
as	
during	
REM	
sleep	
and	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

Posttraumatic	
nightmares	
may	
take	
the	
form	
of	
a	
realistic	
reliving	
of	
a	
traumatic	DISEASE
event	
or	
may	
depict	
only	
some	
of	
its	
elements	
or	
emotional	
content	
.

Demographics	
Occasional	
nightmares	
are	
very	
common	
in	
children	
,	
occurring	
in	
60	
%	
to	
75	
%	
of	
chil-	
dren	
,	
beginning	
as	
young	
as	
2.5	
years	
of	
age	
.	

The	
occurrence	
of	
occasional	
nightmares	
in	
children	
does	
not	
constitute	
a	
nightmare	
disorder	
.	

However	
,	
frequent	
nightmares	
are	
uncommon	
,	
occurring	
in	
1	
%	
to	
5	
%	
of	
preadolescent	
children	
.	

It	
is	
estimated	
that	
10	
%	
to	
50	
%	
of	
children	
aged	
three	
to	
five	
years	
have	
at	
least	
occasional	
nightmares	
severe	
enough	
to	
disturb	
their	
parents	
.	

Nightmares	
appear	
to	
be	
a	
trait	
-	
like	
characteristic	
that	
persists	
over	
time	
during	
childhood	
.	

The	
best	
predictor	
of	
recurrent	
nightmares	
at	
an	
older	
age	
is	
recurrent	
nightmares	
in	
childhood	
.	

Approximately	
2	
%	
to	
8	
%	
of	
the	
general	
population	
has	
a	
current	
problem	
with	
nightmares	
,	
and	
this	
frequency	
is	
higher	
in	
clini-	
cal	
populations	
.	

Trauma	DISEASE
-	
related	
nightmares	
are	
the	
most	
consistent	
problem	
reported	
by	
patients	
with	
PTSD	DISEASE
.	

Nightmares	
beginning	
within	
three	
months	
of	
a	
trauma	DISEASE
are	
present	
in	
up	
to	
80	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
PTSD	DISEASE
.	

Although	
approximately	
50	
%	
of	
PTSD	DISEASE
cases	
resolve	
within	
three	
months	
,	
posttraumatic	
nightmares	
may	
persist	
throughout	
life	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Frequent	
nightmares	
are	
associated	
with	
enduring	
personality	
characteristics	
and	
psy-	
chopathologies	
;	
they	
are	
inversely	
correlated	
with	
measures	
of	
well	
-	
being	
.	

Associations	
with	
psychopathology	
have	
been	
identified	
for	
adults	
and	
adolescents	
,	
but	
research	
on	
children	
is	
largely	
absent	
other	
than	
for	
assessments	
of	
PTSD	DISEASE
.	

Measures	
of	
nightmare	
distress	
are	
much	
more	
robustly	
associated	
with	
psychopathology	
than	
are	
measures	
of	
nightmare	
frequency	
.

clinical	
use	
of	
pharmacologic	
agents

the	
neurotransmitters

and	
dopamine	CHEMICAL
is	
associated	
with	
the	
complaint

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Nightmares	
usually	
start	
between	
ages	
three	
years	
and	
six	
years	
.	

The	
proportion	
of	
children	
reporting	
nightmares	
reaches	
a	
peak	
between	
six	
and	
ten	
years	
of	
age	
and	
decreases	
thereafter	
.

nightmares	
into	
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
adolescence	DISEASE
or	
adulthood	
and	
may	
become	
lifelong	
nightmare	
sufferers	
.	

Nightmares	
generally	
diminish	
in	
frequency	
and	
intensity	
over	
the	
course	
of	
decades	
,	
but	
some	
patients	
still	
describe	
frequent	
episodes	
at	
the	
age	
of	
60	
or	
70	
years	
.	

Nightmare	
dis-	
order	
can	
lead	
to	
sleep	
avoidance	
and	
deprivation	
,	
and	
thereby	
to	
more	
intense	
night-	
mares	
,	
which	
can	
produce	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

ASD	DISEASE
and	
PTSD	DISEASE
associated	
nightmares	
can	
develop	
at	
any	
age	
after	
physical	
or

tional

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
stated	
above	
,	
nightmares	
are	
very	
common	
in	
children	
but	
the	
occurrence	
of	
occa-	
sional	
nightmares	
does	
not	
constitute	
nightmare	
disorder	
.	

Population	
studies	
have	
revealed	
that	
the	
prevalence	
and	
frequency	
of	
nightmares	
increases	
through	
childhood	
into	
adolescence	
.	

For	
example	
,	
preschoolers	
seldom	
report	
“	
bad	
dreams	
.	
”	

Furthermore	
,	
in	
regard	
to	
the	
prevalence	
of	
nightmares	
,	
children	
appear	
to	
exhibit	
a	
sex	
divergence	
over	
time	
,	
with	
girls	
demonstrating	
higher	
prevalence	
by	
late	
adolescence	
.

Objective	
Findings	
PSG	
recordings	
during	
actual	
nightmares	
are	
few	
in	
number	
and	
,	
in	
some	
instances	
,	
have	
shown	
abrupt	
awakenings	
from	
REM	
sleep	
preceded	
by	
accelerated	
heart	
and	
respiratory	
rates	
.	

Highly	
disturbing	
dream	
content	
frequently	
contrasts	
strikingly	
with	
relatively	
minor	
autonomic	
changes	
.	

Distinctive	
anomalies	DISEASE
in	
nightly	
sleep	
architec-	
ture	
have	
not	
been	
demonstrated	
;	
brainstem	
and	
auditory	
-	
evoked	
potentials	
appear	
normal	
.	

Recordings	
during	
posttraumatic	DISEASE
nightmares	DISEASE
are	
few	
but	
have	
been	
recorded	
from	
both	
REM	
and	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

PSG	
recordings	
of	
sleep	
in	
patients	
with	
PTSD	DISEASE
have	
provided	
widely	
variable	
results	
.	

PSG	
evaluation	
is	
not	
routinely	
performed	
but	
may	
be	
indicated	
in	
some	
circumstances	
to	
exclude	
other	
parasomnias	DISEASE
such	
as	
disorders	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
associated	DISEASE
sei-	DISEASE
zures	DISEASE
.	DISEASE

A	
PSG	
is	
particularly	
appropriate	
if	
patients	
report	
nightmares	
in	
conjunction	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
that	
are	
repetitive	
or	
stereotyped	
or	
are	
injurious	
to	
self	
or	
others	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Nightmare	
disorder	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
dream	
disturbances	
associated	
with	
certain	
other	
neurological	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Rare	
cases	
of	
seizures	DISEASE
presenting	
only	
as	
“	
nightmares	
”	
have	
been	
reported	
and	
should	
be	
considered	
in	
the	
differential	
diagno-	
sis	
,	
particularly	
in	
those	
patients	
who	
present	
with	
a	
history	
of	
central	
nervous	
system	
disease	
.	

PSG	
or	
continuous	
video	
EEG	
may	
be	
necessary	
to	
identify	
nightmares	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
nocturnal	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
.	

Nightmares	
differ	
from	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
in	
having	
detailed	
recollection	
of	
dreaming	
in	
contrast	
to	
fragments	
of	
dreams	
or	
no	
dream	
recall	
,	
pre-	
senting	
no	
or	
minimal	
overt	
movement	
or	
autonomic	
activity	
,	
occurring	
late	
in	
the	
night	
,	
being	
followed	
by	
rapid	
awakening	
and	
difficulty	
returning	
to	
sleep	
,	
and	
most	
often	
arising	
from	
REM	
sleep	
.	

RBD	DISEASE
occurs	
more	
often	
in	
late	
middle	
-	
aged	
men	
and	
is	
more	
often	
associated	
with	
violent	DISEASE
explosive	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
and	
a	
history	
of	
nocturnal	DISEASE
injuries	DISEASE
.	

The	
dream	
disturbance	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
usually	
involves	
being	
threatened	
or	
attacked	
by	
unfamiliar	
people	
or	
animals	
and	
is	
controlled	
in	
tandem	
with	
the	
sleep	
behavioral	
disturbance	
by	
appropriate	
medication	
.	

Nightmares	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
and	
are	
not	
typ-	
ically	
associated	
with	
movements	
,	
overt	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
,	
or	
injuries	DISEASE
.	

Anxiety	DISEASE
may	
accom-

either	
at

,	
and	
,	
at

Anxiety	DISEASE
may	
be	
further	
worsened	
if	
disturbing	
hypnago-

accompany	
the

Nightmares

although	
they	
may	
involve	
some	
degree	
of	
movement	
inhibition	
or	
some	
degree	
of	
apparent

are	
usually	
not	
accompanied	
by	
feelings	
of	
either	
total	
paralysis	DISEASE
or

.	

Patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
often	
report	
nightmares	
;	
these	
may	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

However	
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
and	
nightmare	
disorder	
are	
clearly	
distinguishable	
by	
other	
clinical	
symptoms	
.	

Nocturnal	DISEASE
panic	DISEASE
attacks	DISEASE
occur	
either	
during	
or	
immediately	
after	
nocturnal	
awakenings	
from	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
usually	
in	
the	
first	
four	
hours	
of	
the	
sleep	
episode	
.	

Although	
frequency	
of	
panic	DISEASE
attacks	
is	
correlated	
with	
frequency	
of	
night-	
mares	
and	
many	
patients	
report	
that	
dysphoric	DISEASE

precede	
their	
attacks	
,	
there	
may	
be	
no	
dream	
recall	
reported	
on

Sleep	
related	
dissociative	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
comprise	
a	
sleep	
related	
variant	
of	
the	
dissociative	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
as	
defined	
by	
the	
Diagnostic	
and	
Statistical	
Manual	
of	
Mental	
Disorders	
,	
Fifth	
Edition	
(	
DSM	
-	
V	
)	
.	

These	
include	
dissociative	DISEASE
identity	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
formerly	
called	
multi-	
ple	
personality	
disorder	
)	
and	
dissociative	
fugue	
,	
in	
which	
individuals	
meeting	
waking	
criteria	
for	
these	
diagnoses	
may	
at	
times	
experience	
the	
recall	
of	
actual	
physical	
or	
emotional	
trauma	DISEASE
as	
a	
“	
dream	
”	
during	
periods	
of	
EEG	
-	
documented	
nocturnal	
waking	
.	

Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Nightmares	DISEASE
that	
occur	
intermittently	
during	
the	
course	
of	
ASD	
or	
PTSD	DISEASE
are	
an	
expected	
symptom	
of	
those	
mental	
disorders	
and	
do	
not	
always	
require	
independent	
coding	
as	
nightmare	
disorder	
.	

However	
,	
as	
is	
often	
the	
case	
,	
when	
the	
frequency	
and/or	
severity	
of	
posttraumatic	DISEASE
nightmares	DISEASE
is	
such	
that	
they	
require	
independent	
clinical	
attention	
,	
then	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
nightmare	
disorder	
should	
be	
applied	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
other	
symp-	
toms	
of	
PTSD	DISEASE
may	
have	
largely	
resolved	
while	
the	
nightmares	
persist	
.	

Nightmare	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
be	
coded	
in	
these	
cases	
as	
well	
.	

It	
is	
clinically	
important	
to	
establish	
whether	
nightmares	
are	
associated	
with	
PTSD	DISEASE
or	
ASD	
because	
the	
evaluation	
,	
course	
,	
complications	
,	
and	
treatment	
differ	
significantly	
for	
these	
groups	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Basic	
pathophysiologic	
studies	
are	
still	
needed	
,	
especially	
studies	
contrasting	
“	
idio-	
pathic	
”	
nightmare	
disorder	
and	
nightmares	
associated	
with	
PTSD	DISEASE
.	

In	
particular	
,	
deter-	
mining	
whether	
posttraumatic	DISEASE
nightmares	DISEASE
arise	
from	
sleep	
or	
primarily	
from	
wakeful-	
ness	
would	
be	
an	
important	
distinguishing	
feature	
particularly	
when	
determining	
effec-	
tive	DISEASE
clinical	
interventions	
.	

The	
PSG	
correlates	
of	
nightmare	
disorder	
and	
posttraumatic	
nightmares	
as	
well	
as	
the	
variables	
affecting	
dream	
mentation	
and	
recall	
require	
further	
definition	
and	
delineation	
.	

The	
distinction	
between	
nightmares	
and	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
is	
difficult	
when	
assessed	
only	
by	
questionnaires	
.	

It	
still	
remains	
unclear	
to	
what	
degree	
and	
level	
of	
complexity	
sleep	
mentation	
is	
associated	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
.	

The	
topic	
of	
NREM	
sleep	
dream	
distur-	
bances	
(	
other	
than	
disturbed	
mentation	
that	
may	
occur	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
)	
also	
needs	
formal	
investigation	
,	
including	
whether	
or	
not	
the	
term	
NREM	
sleep	
nightmare	
should	
be	
utilized	
.	

The	
optimal	
methods	
for	
assessing	
nightmare	
frequency	
and	
nightmare	
distress	
are	
still	
unclear	
.	

Standardized	
scales	
assessing	
nightmare	
distress	
should	
be	
developed	
and	
utilized	
.	

Retrospective	
questionnaire	
-	
based	
evaluations	
of	
nightmares	
are	
problematic	
inasmuch	
as	
they	
underestimate	
nightmare	
frequencies	
relative	
to	
home	
logs	
,	
whereas	
home	
logs	
may	
selectively	
increase	
recall	
of	
nightmares	
.

Essential	
Features	
Exploding	
head	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
a	
sudden	
,	
loud	
imagined	
noise	
or	
sense	
of	
a	
violent	DISEASE
explosion	DISEASE
in	
the	
head	
occurring	
as	
the	
patient	
is	
falling	
asleep	
or	
waking	
during	
the	
night	
.	

The	
event	
is	
variously	
described	
as	
a	
painless	
loud	
bang	
,	
an	
explosion	
,	
a	
clash	
of	
cymbals	
,	
or	
a	
bomb	
exploding	
,	
but	
occasionally	
may	
be	
a	
less	
alarming	
sound	
.	

It	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
a	
sense	
of	
fright	
,	
and	
many	
patients	
believe	
they	
are	
having	
a	
stroke	DISEASE
.	

In	
a	
minority	
of	
cases	
a	
flash	
of	
light	
or	
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerk	DISEASE
may	
accompany	
the	
event	
.	

The	
abnormal	
sensation	
lasts	
a	
few	
seconds	
and	
may	
recur	
during	
further	
attempts	
at	
sleeping	
.	

The	
number	
of	
attacks	
varies	
—	
from	
many	
on	
a	
single	
night	
to	
infrequent	
—	
with	
some	
patients	
reporting	
clustering	
of	
attacks	
over	
several	
nights	
fol-	
lowed	
by	
a	
gap	
of	
weeks	
to	
months	
.	

A	
high	
level	
of	
clinical	
distress	
can	
be	
associated	
with	
recurrent	
attacks	
,	
with	
concern	
about	
their	
underlying	
cause	
.	

Associated	
Features	
A	
flash	
of	
light	
may	
accompany	
the	
sound	
,	
and	
a	
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerk	DISEASE
may	
sometimes	
occur	
.	

Although	
the	
event	
is	
typically	
painless	
,	
a	
simultaneous	
stab	
of	
pain	DISEASE
in	
the	
head	
has	
occasionally	
been	
reported	
.	

An	
insomnia	DISEASE
complaint	DISEASE
may	
develop	
as	
a	
result	
of	
the	
recurring	
arousals	DISEASE
and	
anxiety	DISEASE
regarding	
the	
events	
.	

Clinical	
or	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
None	
known	
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
is	
unknown	
.	

Exploding	
head	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
reported	
to	
be	
more	
common	
in	
women	
than	
in	
men	
.	

The	
median	
age	
of	
onset	
is	
58	
years	
,	
but	
onset	
at	
all	
ages	
has	
been	
reported	
,	
including	
the	
first	
and	
eighth	
decades	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Most	
patients	
do	
not	
detect	
precipitating	
factors	
,	
but	
some	
report	
increased	
numbers	
of	
attacks	DISEASE
when	
under	
personal	
stress	
or	
overtired	
.	

Familial	
Pattern	
Occasional	
cases	
of	
exploding	
head	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
occurring	
in	
the	
same	
family	
have	
been	
reported	
,	
although	
it	
is	
not	
clear	
whether	
this	
represents	
a	
true	
familial	
pattern	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complication	
The	
course	
is	
benign	
with	
no	
reported	
neurologic	DISEASE
sequelae	DISEASE
.	

Frequent	
events	
on	
a	
single	
night	
can	
result	
in	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Clinical	
levels	
of	
anxiety	DISEASE
may	
result	
from	
patient	
concern	
about	
a	
serious	
medical	
basis	
for	
the	
exploding	
head	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
.	

The	
condition	
may	
also	
exacerbate	
a	
comorbid	
migraine	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

In	
many	
patients	
,	
the	
symptoms	
appear	
to	
remit	
spontaneously	
over	
some	
years	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Not	
known	
or	
applicable	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
events	
occur	
most	
frequently	
during	
a	
period	
of	
drowsiness	DISEASE
preceding	
sleep	
.	

Some	
events	
are	
reported	
to	
occur	
upon	
waking	
during	
the	
night	
,	
but	
may	
actually	
be	
occur-	
ring	
during	
reinitiating	
sleep	
.	

The	
condition	
appears	
to	
be	
a	
sensory	
variant	
of	
the	
better	
-	
known	
transient	
motor	
phenomenon	
of	
sleep	
starts	
or	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
occurring	
at	
wake	
-	
sleep	
transition	
.	

The	
neurophysiologic	
mechanisms	
underlying	
these	
hypnago-	
gic	
phenomena	
are	
unknown	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
VPSG	
in	
a	
small	
sample	
of	
patients	
found	
that	
events	
arose	
from	
early	
drowsiness	DISEASE
with	
predominant	
alpha	
rhythm	
interspersed	
with	
some	
theta	
activity	
.	

In	
one	
patient	
,	
events	
arose	
during	
transition	
from	
N1	
sleep	
,	
in	
another	
patient	
from	
N1	
sleep	
to	
wakeful-	
ness	
,	
and	
in	
a	
third	
patient	
from	
N2	
sleep	
to	
wakefulness	
.	

Events	
occurring	
in	
the	
N1/	
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
N2	
to	
wake	
transition	
have	
been	
recorded	
during	
both	
nocturnal	
vPSG	
and	
MSLTs	DISEASE
.	

Slow	
eye	
movements	
were	
present	
in	
the	
only	
tracing	
reproduced	
in	
the	
report	
of	
a	
patient	
with	
exploding	
head	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
emerging	
during	
wake	
to	
N1	
sleep	
transition	
.	

Arousals	DISEASE
occurred	
immediately	
following	
the	
episodes	
.	

No	
epileptiform	
discharges	
accompany	
the	
event	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Exploding	
head	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
sudden	
onset	
-	
headache	
syn-	
dromes	
.	

“	
Idiopathic	DISEASE
stabbing	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
”	DISEASE
(	
ice	
-	
pick	
headache	DISEASE
)	
is	
a	
benign	
syndrome	
of	
brief	
stabs	
of	
pain	DISEASE
on	
the	
side	
of	
the	
head	
.	

Although	
they	
can	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
,	
they	
are	
more	
common	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

“	
Thunderclap	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
”	
is	
a	
very	
severe	
sudden	
onset	
headache	DISEASE
characteristic	
of	
subarachnoid	DISEASE
hemorrhage	DISEASE
but	
also	
resulting	
from	
other	
causes	
and	
occasionally	
occurring	
as	
a	
benign	
symptom	
.	

It	
does	
not	
usually	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

“	
Hypnic	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
”	
affects	
older	
people	
who	
regularly	
awaken	
4	
-	
6	
hours	
after	
sleep	
onset	
,	
with	
a	
diffuse	
headache	DISEASE
that	
lasts	
30	
-	
60	
minutes	
and	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
nausea	DISEASE
but	
no	
autonomic	
symptoms	
.	

Other	
conditions	
to	
be	
con-	
sidered	
include	
sleep	
related	
migraines	DISEASE
,	
cluster	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
,	
and	
nocturnal	DISEASE
paroxysmal	DISEASE
hemicrania	DISEASE
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
headache	DISEASE
syndromes	
,	
exploding	
head	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
is	
usually	
painless	
.	

Simple	
partial	
seizures	DISEASE
can	
present	
with	
sensory	
phenomena	
but	
do	
not	
usually	
occur	
predominantly	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

Nocturnal	DISEASE
panic	DISEASE
attacks	DISEASE
can	
waken	
a	
person	
from	
sleep	
,	
but	
are	
not	
usually	
associated	
with	
a	
sense	
of	
noise	
or	
explosion	
.	

Recurrent	
night-	
mares	
are	
characterized	
by	
recall	
of	
more	
complex	
and	
longer	
-	
lasting	
visual	
imagery	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
occur	
at	
wake	
-	
sleep	
transition	
but	
are	
predominantly	
a	
motor	
phenomenon	
with	
sudden	DISEASE
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
rather	
than	
an	
emphasis	
on	
sensory	
symptoms	
.

The	
neurophysiologic	
basis	
of	
these

A.	

There	
is	
a	
complaint	
of	
recurrent	
hallucinations	DISEASE
that	
are	
experienced	
just	
prior	
to	
sleep	
onset	
or	
upon	
awakening	
during	
the	
night	
or	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

B.	
The	
hallucinations	DISEASE
are	
predominantly	
visual

The	
disturbance	
is	
not

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
are	
hallucinatory	DISEASE
experiences	
that	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
or	
on	
awakening	
from	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
are	
predominantly	
visual	
but	
may	
include	
auditory	
,	
tactile	
,	
or	
kinetic	
phenomena	
.	

Hallucinations	DISEASE
at	
sleep	
onset	
(	
hypnagogic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
)	
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
differentiate	
from	
sleep	
onset	
dream-	
ing	
.	

Hallucinations	DISEASE
on	
waking	
in	
the	
morning	
(	
hypnopompic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
)	
may	
arise	
out	
of	
a	
period	
of	
REM	
sleep	
,	
and	
patients	
also	
may	
be	
uncertain	
whether	
they	
rep-	
resent	
waking	
or	
dream	
-	
related	
experiences	
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	DISEASE
visual	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
may	
represent	
a	
distinct	
form	
of	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
.	

They	
typically	
occur	
fol-	DISEASE
lowing	
a	
sudden	
awakening	
,	
without	
recall	
of	
a	
preceding	
dream	
.	

They	
usually	
take	
the	
form	
of	
complex	
,	
vivid	
,	
relatively	
immobile	
images	
of	
people	
or	
animals	
,	
sometimes	
distorted	
in	
shape	
or	
size	
.	

These	
hallucinations	DISEASE
may	
remain	
present	
for	
many	
minutes	
but	
usually	
disappear	
if	
ambient	
illumination	
is	
increased	
.	

Patients	
are	
clearly	
awake	
but	
often	
initially	
perceive	
the	
hallucinations	DISEASE
as	
real	
and	
frightening	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
may	
be	
associated	
with	
episodes	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
,	
either	
at	
the	
same	
time	
or	
on	
different	
nights	
.	

Patients	
with	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hal-	
lucinations	
may	
jump	
out	
of	
the	
bed	
in	
terror	
,	
sometimes	
injuring	
themselves	
.	

Some	
patients	
may	
experience	
other	
parasomnias	DISEASE
,	
such	
as	
sleep	
talking	
or	
sleepwalking	
,	
sep-	CHEMICAL
arate	
from	
the	
hallucinations	DISEASE
;	
some	
patients	
may	
also	
experience	
similar	
complex	
hal-	
lucinations	
during	
the	
day	
,	
unassociated	
with	
sleep	
.

Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
are	
common	
in	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
and	
also	
occur	
as	
occasional	
phenomena	
in	
a	
high	
per-	
centage	
of	
the	
general	
population	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucina-	
tions	
appear	
to	
be	
rare	
and	
occur	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
a	
range	
of	
neurologic	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
visual	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
(	
see	
Differential	
Diagnosis	
)	
as	
well	
as	
in	
an	
idiopathic	DISEASE
form	
.	

However	
,	
further	
work	
is	
needed	
to	
establish	
whether	
or	
not	
these	
forms	
of	
hallucinations	DISEASE
represent	
different	
entities	
.	

Demographics	
In	
large	
European	
population	
studies	
,	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
have	
been	
reported	
to	
occur	
with	
a	
prevalence	
of	
25	
%	
to	
37	
%	
for	
hypnagogic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
,	
whereas	
the	
equivalent	
reported	
prevalence	
for	
hypnopompic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
is	
7	
%	
to	
13	
%	
.	

Both	
hypnagogic	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
hypnopompic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
are	
more	
common	
in	
younger	
persons	
and	
occur	
slightly	
more	
frequently	
in	
women	
than	
in	
men	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Multivariate	
analyses	
in	
large	
population	
studies	
have	
suggested	
that	
sleep	
related	
hal-	
lucinations	
are	
associated	
with	
younger

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
appear	
to	
be	
more	
common	
in	
adolescence	
and	
early	
adult-	DISEASE
hood	
.	

In	
many	
patients	
,	
the	
frequency	
appears	
to	
decrease	
with	
age	
.	

The	
natural	
history	
of	
complex	
nocturnal	DISEASE

hallucinations	DISEASE
depends	
on	
the	
underlying	
cause	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Not	
known	
or	
applicable	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
It	
is	
presumed	
that	
most	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
are	
due	
to	
dream	
ideation	DISEASE
of	
REM	
sleep	
intruding	
into	
wakefulness	
,	
but	
this	
has	
not	
been	
firmly	
established	
.	

Infrequent	
hallucinations	DISEASE
of	
this	
type	
may	
be	
within	
the	
limits	
of	
normal	
sleep	
-	
wake	
transition	
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	DISEASE
visual	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
may	
in	
some	
cases	
be

Objective	
Findings	
Hypnagogic	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
appear	
to	
arise	
predominantly	
from	
sleep	
onset	
REM	
periods	
.	

However	
,	
the	
very	
few	
reports	
of	
polysomnography	
in	
complex	
nocturnal	DISEASE
visual	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
suggest	
an	
onset	
from	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

MRI	
scans	
of	
the	
brain	
,	
PSG	
,	
EEG	
,	
and	
neuropsychological	
testing	
may	
help	
in	
the	
differential	
diagnosis	
and	
in	
identifying	
underlying	
disorders	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Nightmares	
are	
frightening	
dreams	
awakening	
the	
patient	
from	
sleep	
.	

They	
are	
clearly	
recognized	
as	
dreams	
and	
do	
not	
persist	
into	
wakefulness	
.	

Exploding	
head	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
consists	
of	
a	
sudden	
sensation	
of	
an	
explosion	
in	
the	
head	
,	
usually	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
sometimes	
accompanied	
by	
a	
noise	
or	
flash	
of	
light	
.	

It	
does	
not	
involve	
complex	
visual	
imagery	
and	
lasts	
only	
seconds	
.	

In	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
the	
patient	
acts	
out	
dreams	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

If	
not	
awakened	
by	
an	
observer	
,	
the	
person	
usually	
has	
little	
recollection	
of	
dream	
content	
.	

Sleepwalking	
may	
occasionally	
be	
associated	
with	
dream	DISEASE
ideation	DISEASE
,	
but	
the	
patient	
recognizes	
that	
the	
dream	
occurred	
during	
sleep	
.	

Visual	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
can	
be	
due	
to	
epileptic	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
but	
are	
usually	
brief	
,	
stereotyped	
,	
and	
fragmentary	
in	
such	
cases	
.	

Occasionally	
,	
complex	
visual	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
may	
be	
associated	
with	
migraine	DISEASE
but	
are	
usually	
followed	
by	
a	
headache	DISEASE
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	DISEASE
visual	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
may	
be	
seen	
in	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
PD	DISEASE
,	
DLB	DISEASE
,	
visual	DISEASE
loss	DISEASE
(	
Charles

)	
,	
and	
midbrain	
and	
diencephalic	
pathology	
(	
peduncular	
hallucinosis	DISEASE
)	
,	
as	
well	
as	
with	
the	
use	
of	
β	
-	
adrenergic	
receptor-	
blocking	
medications	
.	

Anxiety	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
have	
been	
noted	
in	
some	
patients

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

In	
contrast	
to	
the	
extensive	
study	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
,	
little	
work	
has	
been	
reported	
on	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
.	

It	
is	
uncertain	
whether	
they	
represent	
normal	
variants	
or	
pathologic	
entities	
.	

It	
is	
unclear	
whether	
they	
are	
always	
associated	
with	
REM	
sleep	
intruding	
into	
wakefulness	
.	

It	
is	
uncertain	
how	
frequently	
complex	
nocturnal	DISEASE
visual	DISEASE
hallucinations	DISEASE
are	
an	
independent	
entity	
,	
as	
opposed	
to	
representing	
a	
final	
common	
pathway	
of	
a	
range	
of	
other	
disorders	
.	

Further	
work	
is	
needed	
to	
determine	
from	
which	
stages	
of	
sleep	
they	
arise	
.

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	DISEASE
enuresis	DISEASE
(	
SE	DISEASE
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
recurrent	
involuntary	
voiding	
that	
occurs	
during	
sleep	
.	

In	
primary	
SE	DISEASE
,	
recurrent	
involuntary	
voiding	
occurs	
at	
least	
twice	
a	
week	
during	
sleep	
after	
five	
years	
of	
age	
in	
a	
patient	
who	
has	
never	
been	
consistently	
dry	
during	
sleep	
for	
six	
consecutive	
months	
.	

SE	DISEASE
is	
considered	
secondary	
in	
a	
child	
or	
adult	
who	
had	
previously	
been	
dry	
for	
six	
consecutive	
months	
and	
then	
began	
wetting	
at	
least	
twice	
a	
week	
.	

Both	
primary	
and	
secondary	
enuresis	
must	
be	
present	
for	
a	
period	
of	
at	
least	
three	
months	
.	

Though	
primary	
and	
secondary	
enuresis	DISEASE
share	
the	
common	
symptom	
of	
voiding	
during	
sleep	
,	
they	
are	
understood	
as	
distinct	
phenomena	
with	
different	
etiologies	
.	

SE	DISEASE
is	
associated	
with	
difficulty	
arousing	
from	
sleep	
in	
response	
to	
an	
urge	
to	
urinate	
and	
may	
occur	
during	
any	
sleep	
stage	
.	

Sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
that	
fragment	
sleep	
such	
as	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
are	
associated	
with	
SE	DISEASE
,	
and	
treatment	
of	
these	
disorders	
may	
cure	
or	
reduce	
their	
incidence	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Involuntary	
voiding	
during	
wakefulness	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
SE	DISEASE
and	
,	
if	
present	
,	
generally	
points	
toward	
a	
physiological	
etiology	
.	

Psychosocial	
problems	
are	
consid-	
ered	
a	
relatively	
rare	
cause	
in	
primary	
SE	DISEASE
,	
though	
it	
does	
occur	
more	
commonly	
in	
children	
with	
attention	DISEASE
deficit	DISEASE
hyperactivity	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
and	
in	
children	
living	
in	
disorga-	
nized	
families	
.	

Secondary	DISEASE
SE	DISEASE
is	
seen	
more	
commonly	
in	
children	
who	
have	
recently	
experienced	
a	
significant	
psychosocial	
stress	
,	
such	
as	
parental	
divorce	
,	
physical	
or	
sexual	
abuse	
,	
or	
neglect	
.	

Chronic	DISEASE
constipation	DISEASE
and	
encopresis	DISEASE
(	
fecal	
soiling	
)	
often	
occur	
in	
children	
with	
secondary	
SE	DISEASE
.	

SE	DISEASE
can	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
diabetes	DISEASE
and	
urinary	
tract	
infection	DISEASE
.	

It	
may	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
nocturnal	DISEASE
epilepsy	DISEASE
.	

Among	
older	
adults	
,	
SE	DISEASE
may	
be	
associated	
with	
symptoms	
of	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
depression	DISEASE
,	
and	
dementia	DISEASE
.	

SRBD	
is	
reported	
in	
8	
%	
to	
47	
%	
of	
children	
with	
enuresis	DISEASE
,	
compared	
to	
an	
overall

Parasomnias	DISEASE
Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
The	
most	
important	
distinction	
is	
between	
primary	
and	
secondary	
SE	DISEASE
.	

Demographics	
SE	DISEASE
occurs	
in	
15	
%	
to	
20	
%	
of	
5	
-	
year	
-	
olds	
.	

It	
is	
three	
times	
more	
common	
in	
boys	
than	
in	
girls	
.	

SE	DISEASE
is	
reported	
by	
2.1	
%	
of	
community	
-	
dwelling	
older	
adults	
and	
is	
more	
common	
among	
women	
than	
men	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
etiology	
of	
SE	DISEASE
is	
complex	
.	

The	
factors	
that	
precipitate	
SE	DISEASE
on	
a	
particular	
night	
and	
at	
a	
particular	
time	
remain	
unknown	
.	

One	
popular	
model	
hypothesizes	
that	
SE	DISEASE
consists	
of	
three	
interrelated	
factors	
:	
large	
nocturnal	
urine	
volume	
production	
,	
noc-	
turnal	
bladder	DISEASE
overactivity	DISEASE
,	
and	
difficulty	
arousing	
from	
sleep	
.	

Several	
studies	
suggest	
difficulty	
arousing	
from	
sleep	
is	
most	
important	
in	
primary	
enuresis	DISEASE
,	
whereas	
bladder	DISEASE
instability	DISEASE
/	DISEASE
overactivity	DISEASE
is	
more	
important	
in	
secondary	
enuresis	DISEASE
.	

Children	
with	
enuresis	DISEASE
are	
often	
described	
by	
their	
families	
as	
“	
deep	
sleepers	
”	
and	
very	
difficult	
to	
arouse	
.	

A	
high	
arousal	
threshold	
has	
been	
objectively	
confirmed	
in	
these	
children	
.	

It	
has	
been	
reported	
that	
fragmentation	
of	
sleep	
by	
disorders	
such	
as	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
is	
highly	
correlated	
with	
SE	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	DISEASE
fragmenting	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	DISEASE
as	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
and	
PLMS	DISEASE
have	
been	
previously	
reported	
to	
be	
proximal	
triggers	
for	
the	
occurrence	
of	
disorders	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
—	DISEASE
sleepwalking	DISEASE
,	
confusional	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
,	
and	
night	
terrors	DISEASE
.	

Successful	
treatment	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
in	
these	
disorders	
has	
been	
reported	
to	
result	
in	
reduction	
or	
elimination	
of	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Similarly	
,	
surgical	
treatment	
of	
sleep	
apneas	
by	
adenotonsillec-	
tomy	
has	
been	
reported	
to	
cure	
nocturnal	DISEASE
enuresis	DISEASE
in	
60	
%	
or	
more	
of	
patients	
,	
although	
this	
is	
not	
a	
consistent	
result	
.	

Several	
studies	
have	
noted	
the	
presence	
of	
sleep	
related	
breathing	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
in	
>	
40	
%	
of	
enuresis	DISEASE
patients	
studied	
.	

However	
,	
not	
all	
sleep	
studies	
have	
noted	
SRBD	
in	
patients	
with	
enuresis	DISEASE
.	

Those	
without	
SRBD	
were	
still	
found	
to	
have	
high	
arousal	
threshold	
from	
sleep	
.	

Primary	DISEASE
SE	DISEASE
is	
a	
disorder	
that	
occurs	
when	
an	
individual	
fails	
to	
arouse	
from	
sleep	
in	
response	
to	
bladder	DISEASE
sensations	DISEASE
or	
fails	
to	
inhibit	
a	
bladder	
contraction	
.	

These	
are	
devel-	
opmentally	
acquired	
skills	
,	
and	
,	
as	
such	
,	
there	
is	
a	
range	
in	
the	
ages	
of	
their	
acquisition	
.	

A	
small	
proportion	
of	
children	
with	
primary	DISEASE
SE	DISEASE
lack	
the	
normal	
increase	
in	
vasopressin	CHEMICAL
release	
during	
sleep	
,	
leading	
to	
a	
high	
urinary	
volume	
that	
exceeds	
the	
bladder	
capac-	
ity	
.	

If	
these	
children	
do	
not	
arouse	
to	
the	
sensation	
of	
a	
full	
bladder	
,	
primary	
SE	DISEASE
is	
the	
result	
.	

Secondary	DISEASE
SE	DISEASE
can	
be	
caused	
by	
,	
or	
be	
associated	
with	
,	
any	
one	
of	
the	
following	
identifiable	
problems	
:	
(

,

,

or

abuse	
,	
and	
institution-	
alization	
.	

The	
mechanisms	
by	
which	
secondary	
SE	DISEASE
is	
associated	
with	
these	
problems	
are	
often	
not	
understood	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Hereditary	
factors	
are	
suspected	
in	
children	
with	
primary	DISEASE
enuresis	DISEASE
.	

There	
is	
often	
a	
high	
prevalence	
of	
enuresis	DISEASE
among	
the	
parents	
,	
siblings	
,	
and	
other	
relatives	
of	
the	
child	
with	
primary	DISEASE
enuresis	DISEASE
.	

The	
reported	
prevalence	
is	
77	
%	
when	
both	
parents	
were	
enuretic	
as	
children	
and	
44	
%	
when	
one	
parent	
has	
a	
history	
of	
enuresis	DISEASE
.	

Recent	
linkage	
studies	
support	
the	
hypothesis	
of	
genetic	
and	
phenotypic	
heterogeneity	
of	
SE	DISEASE
.	

A	
putative	
linkage	
of	
SE	DISEASE
to	
a	
region	
on	
chromosomes	
22q	
,	
13q	
,	
and	
12q	
across	
different	
families	
has	
been	
reported	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Voiding	
is	
a	
spinal	
reflex	
during	
wakefulness	
and	
sleep	
during	
infancy	
,	
until	
about	
18	
months	
of	
age	
.	

Between	
18	
months	
and	
three	
years	
of	
age	
,	
the	
child	
is	
able	
to	
delay	
voiding	
with	
a	
full	
bladder	
,	
first	
during	
wakefulness	
and	
at	
a	
later	
age	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
primary	
determinant	
of	
the	
age	
at	
which	
this	
skill	
is	
acquired	
is	
developmental	
matura-	
tion	
.	

Somewhat	
arbitrarily	
,	
primary	
SE	DISEASE
is	
defined	
as	
a	
problem	
if	
it	
persists	
beyond	
five	
years	
of	
age	
.	

The	
spontaneous	
cure	
rate	
is	
15	
%	
per	
year	
.	

The	
primary	
complication	
of	
SE	DISEASE
is	
to	
the	
child	
’s	
self	
-	
esteem	
.	

How	
well	
the	
child	
’s	
family	
deals	
with	
the	
symptom	
is	
an	
important	
determinant	
of	
whether	
complications	
develop	
.	

Secondary	DISEASE
SE	DISEASE
can	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
.	

Complications	
of	
secondary	
SE	DISEASE
are	
determined	
by	
the	
problem	
leading	
to	
the	
enuresis	DISEASE
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
The	
developmental	
pattern	
of	
enuresis	DISEASE
is	
similar	
to	
NREM	
parasomnias	DISEASE
,	
although	
its	
first	
occurrence	
in	
adulthood	
is	
uncommon	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
SE	DISEASE
is	
a	
heterogeneous	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
with	
various	
underlying	
pathophysiological	
mecha-	
nisms	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
mismatch	
between	
nocturnal	
bladder	
capacity	
and	
the	
amount	
of	
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
urine	
produced	
during	
sleep	
,	
in	
association	
with	
a	
simultaneous	
failure	
of	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
in	
response	
to	
the	
sensation	
of	
bladder	DISEASE
fullness	DISEASE
.	

SE	DISEASE
can	
be	
seen	
in	
association	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
fragmentation	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
including	
SRBD	
,	
which	
in	
children	
is	
most	
often	
secondary	
to	
adenotonsillar	DISEASE
hypertrophy	DISEASE
.	

Objective	
Findings	
In	
primary	
and	
secondary	
SE	DISEASE
,	
enuretic	
episodes	
can	
occur	
in	
all	
sleep	
stages	
,	
during	
nocturnal	
wakefulness	
,	
and	
in	
association	
with	
transient	
arousals	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
stages	
have	
not	
been	
found	
to	
be	
different	
on	
nights	
when	
enuresis	DISEASE
occurs	
versus	
nights	
on	
which	
it	
does	
not	
occur	
.	

The	
results	
of	
polysomnographic	
studies	
of	
children	
with	
enuresis	DISEASE
com-	
pared	
to	
normal	
controls	
have	
been	
inconsistent	
.	

A	
computerized	
power	
analysis	
of	
sleep	
data	
suggested	
an	
increase	
in	
delta	
power	
,	
whereas	
the	
majority	
of	
other	
studies	
have	
reported	
no	
differences	
.	

However	
,	
a	
recent	
study	
found	
those	
age	
6	
-	
14	
years	
had	
elevated	
light	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
and	
reduced	
N3	
sleep	
and	
REM	
sleep	
compared	
to	
normal	
controls	
.	

The	
population	
with	
enuresis	DISEASE
had	
a	
significantly	
elevated	
arousal	
index	
.	

SRBD	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
in	
8	
%	
to	
47	
%	
of	
children	
with	
SE	DISEASE
.	

SE	DISEASE
and	
sleep	
apnea	DISEASE
are	
highly	
correlated	
with	
an	
increasing	
prevalence	
of	
enuresis	DISEASE
as	
the	
respiratory	
distur-	
bance	
index	
(	
RDI	
)	
increases	
.	

In	
addition	
to	
SRBD	
,	
PLMS	DISEASE
(	
range	
of	
3.9	
to	
38.6	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
)	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
a	
group	
of	
children	
with	
treatment	
-	
resistant	
SE	DISEASE
.	

Recent	
studies	
have	
demonstrated	
that	
patients	
with	
enuresis	DISEASE
are	
subjectively	
sleepier	
than	
normal	
controls	
.	

This	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
to	
result	
from	
fragmented	
nocturnal	
sleep	
and	
is	
consistent	
with	
a	
large	
body	
of	
sleep	
research	
in	
other	
areas	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Enuresis	DISEASE
may	
be	
caused	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
medical	
or	
neurological	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
diabetes	DISEASE
mellitus	DISEASE
,	
diabetes	DISEASE
insipidus	DISEASE
,	
epilepsy	DISEASE
,	
sickle	DISEASE
cell	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
bowel	
or	
bladder	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
,	
anatomical	
abnormalities	
or	
infection	DISEASE
of	
the	
urinary	
tract	
,	
neurological/	DISEASE
developmental	
disorders	
or	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
especially	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

Organic	
pathology	
of	
the	
urinary	
tract	
is	
more	
prevalent	
in	
children	
who	
,	
in	
addition	
to	
sleep	DISEASE
enuresis	DISEASE
,	
also	
exhibit	
daytime	DISEASE
enuresis	DISEASE
,	
abnormalities	
in	
the	
initiation	
of	
micturition	
,	
or	
abnormal	
urinary	
flow	
.	

Evaluation	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
enuresis	DISEASE
should	
include	
complete	
enuresis	DISEASE
history	
,	
sleep	
history	
,	
physical	
examination	
and	
laboratory	
studies	
(	
as	
indicated	
)	
to	
exclude	
these	
etiol-	
ogies	
.	

When	
signs	
and	
symptoms	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
are	
present	
—	
mouth	
breathing	
,	
snoring	DISEASE
,	
adenotonsillar	DISEASE
hypertrophy	DISEASE
,	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
hyperactivity	DISEASE
—	
a	
sleep	
study	
should	
be	
conducted	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
Recent	
advances	
suggest	
that	
the	
terms	
primary	
and	
secondary	
enuresis	DISEASE
may	
be	
overly	
simplistic	
.	

Further	
work	
is	
necessary	
to	
understand	
the	
genetic	
and	
clinical	
aspects	
of	
SE	DISEASE
.	

Other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
are	
common	
in	
children	
with	
SE	DISEASE
.	

Though	
it	
may	
be	
possible	
that	
the	
apneas	
,	
hypopneas	DISEASE
,	
and	
snoring	
-	
related	
arousals	DISEASE
in	
children	
with	
SRBD	
could	
be	
the	
trigger	
of	
SE	DISEASE
,	
many	
children	
with	
SE	DISEASE
do	
not	
have	
a	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

In	
such	
cases	
,	
the	
underlying	
bladder	DISEASE
overactivity	DISEASE
may	
be	
the	
stimulus	
for	
arousal	
.	

Studies	
of	
the	
relationship	
of	
sleep	
,	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
and	
sleep	
fragmentation	
to	
SE	DISEASE
performed	
to	
date	
have	
been	
inconsistent	
.	

This	
is	
likely	
due	
to	
differing	
definitions	
of	
enuresis	DISEASE
and	
varying	
research	
methodologies	
.	

Further	
sophisticated	
sleep	
laboratory	
studies	
are	
necessary	
to	
elucidate	
the	
relationship	
.	

In	
particular	
,	
the	
proximal	
trigger	
for	
episodes	
of	
SE	DISEASE
has	
not	
been	
determined	
.	

Some	
studies	
suggest	
enuresis	DISEASE
is	
sponta-	
neous	
,	
whereas	
others	
suggest	
a	
relationship	
to	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
that	
result	
in	
arousals	DISEASE
—	
similar	
to	
findings	
in	
disorders	
of	
arousal

The	
essential	
feature	
of	
this	
diagnosis	
is	
the	
presence	
of	
a	
parasomnia	DISEASE
that	
is	
attrib-	
utable	
to	
an	
underlying	
neurological	
or	
medical	
condition	
.	

RBD	DISEASE
is	
the	
parasomnia	DISEASE
most	
commonly	
associated	
with	
an	
underlying	
neurological	
condition	
(	
“	
symptomatic	
RBD	DISEASE
”	
)	
.	

However	
,	
when	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
RBD	DISEASE
are	
met	
,	
the	
more	
specific	
diagno-	
sis	
of	
REM	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
be	
made	
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	
sleep	
related	
(	
hypnagogic	
and	
hypnopompic	DISEASE
)	
visual	
hallucina-	
tions	
can	
occur	
with	
neurological	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
PD	DISEASE
,	
DLB	DISEASE
,	
visual	DISEASE

(

for

instructions	
)	

The	
essential	
feature	
of	
this	
diagnosis	
is	
the	
close	
temporal	
relationship	
between	
expo-	
sure	
to	
a	
drug	
,	
medication	
,	
or	
biological	
substance	
and	
the	
onset	
of	
the	
signs	
and	
symp-	
toms	
of	
that	
disorder	
.	

A	
likely	
causal	
relationship	
can	
be	
inferred	
if	
signs	
and	
symp-	
toms	
of	
the	
parasomnia	DISEASE
disappear	
when	
the	
drug	
or	
substance	
is	
withdrawn	
.	

The	
emergent	
parasomnia	DISEASE
can	
be	
a	
de	
novo	
parasomnia	DISEASE
,	
the	
aggravation	
of	
a	
chronic	
intermittent	
parasomnia	DISEASE
,	
or	
the	
reactivation	
of	
a	
previous	
parasomnia	DISEASE
.	

As	
discussed	
previously	
,	
a	
variety	
of	
medications	
and	
biological	
substances	
,	
including	
selective	
serotonin	CHEMICAL
reuptake	
inhibitors	
,	
venlafaxine	CHEMICAL
,	
tricyclic	
antidepressants	CHEMICAL
,	
mono-	CHEMICAL
amine	CHEMICAL
oxidase

,	
mirtazapine	CHEMICAL
,	
bisoprolol	CHEMICAL
,	
selegiline	CHEMICAL
,	
or	
cholinergic	
treatment	
for	
Alzheimer	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
associated	
with	
acute	
or	
chronic	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

Acute	
RBD	DISEASE
can	
also	
be	
seen	
during	
states	
of	
withdrawal	
from	
cocaine	CHEMICAL
,	
amphetamine	CHEMICAL
,	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
,	
barbiturate	CHEMICAL
,	
and	
meprobamate	CHEMICAL
abuse	
.	

Caffeine	CHEMICAL
and	
chocolate	DISEASE
abuse	DISEASE
have	
been	
implicated	
in	
causing	
or	
unmasking	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
when	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
RBD	DISEASE
are	
met	
,	
the	
more	
specific	
diagnosis	
of	
REM	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
should	
be	
made	
.	

The	
use	
of	
medications	
such	
as	
β	
-	
adrenergic	
receptor	
-	
blocking	
agents	
can	
be	
associ-	
ated	
with	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
.	

When	
the	
clinical	
presentation	
suggests	
a	
direct	
relationship	
between	
a	
drug	
or	
substance	
and	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	DISEASE
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
parasomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
should	
be	
employed	
.	

Sedative	
-	
hypnotics	
such	
as	
zolpidem	CHEMICAL
and	
zopiclone	CHEMICAL
have	
been	
associated	
with	
apparent	
NREM	
parasomnias	DISEASE
including	
SRED	
and	
sleep	
driving	
.	

It	
has	
been	
suggested	
that	
sleep	
driving	
is	
an	
overlap	
behavior	
in	
which	
the	
sedative	
-	
hypnotic	
increases	
the	
arousal	
threshold	
during	
sleep	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
the	
behavior	
,	
while	
later	
behavior	
is	
due	
to	
the	
CNS	
depressing	
effects	
of	
the	
drug	
while	
awake	
.	

It	
has	
not	
been	
determined	
if	
drug	
-	
re-	
lated	
NREM	DISEASE
parasomnias	DISEASE
are	
associated	
with	
the	
same	
genetic	
predisposition	
,	
priming	
factors	
,	
and	
triggers	
observed	
in	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

When	
clinical	
presentation	
sug-	
gests	
a	
direct	
relationship	
between	
disorders	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
use	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
a	DISEASE
drug	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
substance	DISEASE
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
parasomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
should	
be	
employed	
.	

Alcohol	CHEMICAL
has	
often	
appeared	
on	
lists	
of	
potential	
sleepwalking	
triggers	
without	
a	
basis	
in	
reliable	
empirical	
scientific	
research	
.	

Recent	
evidence	
-	
based	
reviews	
have	
found	
no	
relationship	
between	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
and	
sleepwalking	
.	

The	
behavior	
of	
the	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
-	
in-	
toxicated	
individual	
may	
superficially	
resemble	
that	
of	
the	
sleepwalker	
.	

However	
,	
the	
sleepwalker	
is	
typically	
severely	
cognitively	
impaired	
,	
but	
with	
only	
limited	
motor	
impairment	
.	

The	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
-	
intoxicated	
individual	
’s	
level	
of	
cognitive	
functioning	
may	
be	
reduced	
,	
but	
not	
absent	
,	
whereas	
motor	
behavior	
is	
severely	
impaired	
.	

Proponents	
of	
the	
theory	
of	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
related	
sleepwalking	
suggest	
that	
the	
effects	
of	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
are	
similar	
to	
that	
of	
sleep	
deprivation	
—	
that	
is	
,	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
increases	
deep	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
this	
claim	
in	
not	
substantiated	
by	
sleep	
laboratory	
-	
based	
studies	
in	
normal	
controls	
,	
and	
no	
empirical	
sleep	
studies	
of	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
and	
sleepwalking	DISEASE
have	
ever	
been	
conducted	
.	

There	
is	
no	
scientific	
evidence	
that	
complex	
behaviors	
occurring	
during	
the	
sleep	
period	
following	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
ingestion	
are	
anything	
other	
than	
the	
nocturnal	
wandering	
of	
Parasomnias	DISEASE
Parasomnias	DISEASE
an	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
-	
intoxicated	
individual	
.	

Unconsciousness	DISEASE
,	
intoxication	
,	
and	
sleep	
are	
very	
different	
states	
of	
consciousness	
.	

Parasomnias	DISEASE
should	
be	
easily	
distinguished	
from	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
intoxication	
by	
the	
presence	
of	
significant	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
ingestion	
prior	
to	
bedtime	
.	

The	
association	
of	
therapeutic	
doses	
of	
sedative	
hypnotic	
drugs	
and	
apparent	
para-	
somnias	
should	
be	
carefully	
distinguished	
from	
the	
expected	
effects	
of	
drug	DISEASE
abuse	DISEASE
or	
misuse	
that	
result	
in	
CNS	
depression	DISEASE
.	

Investigations	
of	
drivers	
who	
had	
accidents	DISEASE
attributed	
to	
drug	
-	
related	
sleep	
driving	
are	
reported	
to	
show	
that	
(

)	
blood	
levels	
of	
prescribed	
sedative	
hypnotics	
exceeded	
therapeutic	
ranges	
;	
(

)	
the	
individuals	
failed	
to	
take	
the	
medication	
at	
the	
correct	
time	
or

for	
sufficient	
time

)	
the	
individuals	
combined

and/or	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
.	

Driving	
with	
a	
high	
blood	
level	
of	
a	
sedative

hypnotic	
can	
result	
in	
significant	
cognitive	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
motor	DISEASE
impairment	DISEASE
.	

Serious	DISEASE
accidents	DISEASE
can	
result	
.	

Sleep	
driving	
and	
other	
complex	
behaviors	
in	
this	
population	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
have	
resulted	
from	
drug	
misuse	
and	
abuse	
rather	
than	
true

This	
diagnosis	
is	
intended	
for	
parasomnias	DISEASE
that	
can	
not	
be	
classified	
elsewhere	
or	
for	
cases	
in	
which	
the	
physician	
has	
a	
clinical	
suspicion

a	
parasomnia	DISEASE

establish	
a

Sleep	
Talking	
Alternate	
Names	
Somniloquy	
.	

The	
essential	
feature	
is	
talking	
,	
with	
varying	
degrees	
of	
comprehensibility	
,	
during	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
may	
occur	
during	
REM	
or	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
can	
be	
idiopathic	DISEASE
or	
associated	
with	
parasomnias	DISEASE
such	
as	
RBD	DISEASE
or	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
such	
as	
confusional	
arousal	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
may	
follow	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
sleep	
or	
more	
rarely	
cause	
them	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
is	
highly	
prevalent	
.	

A	
recent	
cross	
-	
sectional	
epidemiologic	
study	
found	
the	
life-	
time	
prevalence	
of	
sleep	
talking	
to	
be	
66	
%	
and	
current	
prevalence	
—	
in	
the	
past	
three	
months	
—	
to	
be	
17	
%	
.	

There	
is	
no	
apparent	
sex	
difference	
.	

Onset	
and	
course	
are	
unknown	
.	

Complications	
usually	
arise	
when	
sleep	
talking	
is	
very	
frequent	
or	
loud	
or	
if	
the	
content	
is	
objectionable	
to	
others	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
is	
usually	
reported	
by	
the	
bed	
partner	
or	
someone	
sleeping	
in	
the	
same	
room	
or	
sleeping	
area	
as	
the	
affected	
individual	
.	

Sleep	
talking	
can	
disrupt	
the	
sleep	
of	
a	
bed	
partner	
,	
roommate	
,	
or	
others	
in	
a	
group	
-	
sleeping	
situation	
(	
such	
as	
college	
dormitories	
,	
military	
barracks	
,	
fire	
stations	
,	
or	
a	
tent	
while	
camping	
)	
.	

The	
content	
of	
sleep	
talking	
has	
not	
been	
shown	
to	
reflect	
actual	
prior	
waking	
behavior	
or	
memories	
.	

The	
sleep	
talker	
is	
rarely	
aware	
of	
his	
or	
her	
sleep	
talking	
.	

Nocturnal	
vocalization	
,	
including	
frank	
sleep	
talking	
,	
is	
often	
seen	
in	
patients	
with	
RBD	DISEASE
and	
subclinical	
RBD	DISEASE
.	

A	
recent	
report	
notes	
that	
sleep	
talking	
may	
be	
a	
useful	
diagnostic	
marker	
for	
differentiating	
DLB	DISEASE
from	
Alzheimer	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
and	
other	
types	
of	
dementia	DISEASE
.	

The	
vocalizations	
of	
RBD	DISEASE
may	
be	
loud	
,	
emotional	
,	
profane	
,	
and	
associated	
with	
behav-	
iors	
that	
correlate	
with	
remembered	
dream	
mentation	
.	

Nocturnal	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
may	
be	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
vocalization	
that	
tends	
to	
be	
stereotypic	
.	

The	
vocalizations	
associated	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
are	
emotionally	
laden	
and	
associated	
with	
behaviors	
of	
intense	
arousal	
and

.	

In	
PTSD	DISEASE
,	
increased	
vocalizations	
during	
sleep	
have	
been	
described

Sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
are	
primarily	
characterized	
by	
relatively	
simple	
,	
usually	
stereotyped	
,	
movements	
that	
disturb	
sleep	
or	
its	
onset	
.	

Restless	DISEASE
legs	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
(	
RLS	DISEASE
)	
is	
an	
exception	
in	
that	
patients	
typically	
engage	
in	
walking	
or	
nonstereotypic	
limb	
movement	
to	
reduce	
leg	
discomfort	
.	

However	
,	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
closely	
associated	
with	
periodic	
limb	
movements	
(	
PLMs	
)	
,	
which	
are	
usually	
simple	
and	
stereotyped	
within	
a	
series	
.	

Nocturnal	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
or	
complaints	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
or	
fatigue	DISEASE
are	
a	
prerequisite	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
a	
sleep	
related	
movement	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

For	
example	
,	
many	
normal	
sleepers	
exhibit	
episodes	
of	
periodic	
limb	
movements	
of	
sleep	
(	
PLMS	DISEASE
)	
but	
have	
no	
complaint	
of	
a	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
,	
nor	
do	
they	
show	
a	
significant	
objective	
dis-	
turbance	
of	
their	
sleep	
as	
a	
result	
of	
the	
movements	
.	

Such	
persons	
should	
not	
be	
classi-	
fied	
as	
having	
periodic	
limb	
movement	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
PLMD	DISEASE
)	
,	
but	
instead	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
should	
simply	
be	
noted	
.	

Similar	
considerations	
relate	
to	
the	
distinction	
between	
rhythmic	
movement	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
and	
the	
presence	
of	
rhythmic	
movements	
.	

Body	
movements	
that	
disturb	
sleep	
also	
are	
seen	
in	
many	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
categories	
(	
e.g.	
,	
in	
parasomnias	DISEASE
such	
as	
sleepwalking	
,	
sleep	DISEASE
terrors	DISEASE
,	
and	
rapid	
eye	
movement	
(	
REM	
)	
sleep	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
RBD	DISEASE
)	
)	
.	

However	
,	
these	
parasomnias	DISEASE
differ	
from	
the	
simple	
ste-	
reotyped	
movements	
categorized	
as	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
in	
that	
they	
involve	
complex	
behaviors	
during	
the	
sleep	
period

.	

Parasomnias	DISEASE
are	
listed	
in	
a	
separate	
section	
from	
the	
sleep

movement	
disorders	
.	

Although	
the	
history	
may	
be	
diagnostic	
,	
polysomnography	
is	
sometimes	
necessary	
to	
make	
a	
firm	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
and	
distinguish	
them	
from	
parasomnias	DISEASE
.	

In	
these	
cases	
,	
it	
is	
necessary	
to	
add	
all	
-	
night	
video	
recording	
to	
the	
poly-	
somnographic	
recording	
and	
to	
correlate	
the	
documented	
movements	
with	
the	
techni-	
cian	
’s	
description	
of	
the	
patient	
’s	
behavior	
and	
level	
of	
consciousness	
in	
order	
to	
estab-	
lish	
a	
diagnosis	
.	

There	
are	
some	
movement	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
that	
may	
occur	
during	
both	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

If	
the	
presentation	
during	
sleep	
is	
significantly	
different	
from	
that	
during	
wakefulness	
,	
or	
if	
the	
movement	
is	
entirely	
confined	
to	
sleep	
,	
then	
the

is	
classified	
here	
(

the

Sometimes	
the

the	
legs	
is	
present	
without	
the

sometimes	
the

the

are

When

Essential	
Features	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
a	
sensorimotor	
disorder	
characterized	
by	
a	
complaint	
of	
a	
strong	
,	
nearly	
irresist-	
ible	
urge	
to	
move	
the	
limbs	
.	

This	
urge	
to	
move	
is	
often	
but	
not	
always	
accompanied	
by	
other	
uncomfortable	
sensations	
felt	
deep	
inside	
the	
limbs	
or	
by	
a	
feeling	
that	
is	
simply	
difficult	
or	
impossible	
to	
describe	
.	

Although	
the	
legs	
are	
most	
prominently	
affected	
,	
“	
restless	
legs	
”	
is	
a	
misnomer	
,	
in	
that	
21	
%	
to	
57	
%	
of	
individuals	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
describe	
some	
arm	
sensations	
.	

The	
most	
common	
adult	
RLS	DISEASE
descriptors	
in	
English	
are	
“	
rest-	
less	
,	
”	
“	
uncomfortable	
,	
”	
“	
twitchy	
,	
”	
“	
need	
to	
stretch	
,	
”	
“	
urge	
to	
move	
,	
”	
and	
“	
legs	
want	
to	
move	
on	
their	
own	
.	
”	

About	
half	
express	
their	
RLS	DISEASE
sensations	DISEASE
as	
painful	
.	

“	
Numb	
”	
and	
“	
cold	
”	
are	
very	
uncommon	
descriptors	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
.

Disturbed	
sleep	
is	
a	
common

aspect	
of	
RLS	DISEASE

Sleep

are	
also

complaints	
;	
however	
,	
the

Clinical	
sleep	
disturbance	
correlates	
with	
both	
severity	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
health	
impact	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Some	
individuals	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
may	
choose	
to	
work	
at	
night	
,	
thereby	
shifting	
quiet	
activities	
and	
their	
sleep	
schedule	
away	
from	
the	
circadian	
peak	
of	
their	
RLS	DISEASE
symptoms	
.	

PLMs	
,	
a	
family	
history	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
and	
response	
to	
dopaminergic	
therapy	
are	
supportive	
of	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

Periodic	
limb	
movements	
can	
occur	
in	
sleep	
(	
PLMS	DISEASE
)	
or	
wakeful-	
ness	
(	
PLMW	
)	
.	

PLMW	
occur	
during	
quiet	
rest	
and	
frequently	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
waking	
and	
sleep	
,	
disrupting	
sleep	
onset	
or	
the

Relevant	
to	
the

relationship	
is	
the

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Evidence	
in	
the	
literature	
is	
not	
sufficient	
to	
support	
well

defined	
subtypes	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Early	
-	
onset	
RLS	DISEASE
(	
prior	
to	
age	
45	
years	
)	
is	
more	
familial	
and	
associated	
with	
slower	
progression	
than	
late

onset	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
classification	
of	
“	
secondary	
”	
RLS	DISEASE
has	
been	
suggested	
when	
the	
condition	
occurs	
in	
association	
with	
iron	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
,	
preg-	
nancy	
,	
and	
chronic	DISEASE
renal	DISEASE

this	
construct	
has	
been	
challenged

history

genetic	
,	
and	
clinical

data

Demographics	
The	
overall	
prevalence	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
has	
been	
estimated	
at	
5	
%	
to	
10	
%	
in	
European

American	
population

However	
,	
in	
Asian	
countries	
,	
studies	
thus	
far	
indicate	
a	
lower	
prevalence	
.	

Prevalence	
is	
about	
twice	
as	
high	
in	
women	
than	
in	
men	
.	

In	
most	
studies	
,	
prevalence	
increases	
with	
age	
up	
to	
60

70	
years	
,	
except	
in	
Asian	
populations	
where	
an	
age

increase	
has	
not	
been

Adolescents	
are

Boys	
are

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
A	
positive	
family	
history	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
the	
genetic	
variants	
noted	
below	
,	
and	
female	
sex	
confer	
increased	
risk	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

The	
best	
characterized	
precipitating	
factors	
are	
iron	CHEMICAL
deficiency	
,	
certain	
medications	
,	
pregnancy	
,	
chronic	DISEASE
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
and	
prolonged	
immo-	
bility	DISEASE

Mild	
iron	DISEASE
deficiency	DISEASE
,	
characterized	
by

,	
has	
been	
associated	
with	
increased	
severity

,	
and	
repletion	
of	
iron	CHEMICAL

been	
found	
to	
diminish	
RLS	DISEASE
symptoms	
.	

Medications	
that	
may	
precip-	
itate	
or	
aggravate	
RLS	DISEASE
and/or	
PLMS	DISEASE
include	
sedating	
antihistamines	CHEMICAL
,	
some	
centrally	
active	
dopamine	CHEMICAL
receptor	
antagonists	
,	
and	
most	
antidepressants	CHEMICAL
.	

An	
exception	
is	
the	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
bupropion	CHEMICAL
,	
with	
its	
dopamine	CHEMICAL

.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
during	
pregnancy	
is	
two	
to	
three	
times	
greater	
than	
in	
the	
general	
population

Parity	
,	
the

sex	
difference	
between	
women	
and	
men	
in	
the	
general	
population	
prevalence	
of	
RLS	DISEASE

In	
chronic	DISEASE
renal	DISEASE

patients	
,	
the	
prevalence	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
two	
to	
five	
times	
greater	
than	
in	
the	
general	
population

This	
represents	
prevalence

11	
%	
to	
58	
%	
in	
US	
and	
European

Compared	
to	
patients	
with	
chronic	DISEASE
renal	DISEASE

without	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
those	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
have	
greater

report	
poorer

and	
more

Typically	
,	
RLS	DISEASE
symptoms	
improve	
dramatically	
within

Familial	
Patterns	
Early	
-	
onset	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
highly	
familial	
,	
with	
40	
%	
to	
92	
%	
of	
cases	
reporting	
affected	
family	
members	
.	

High	
concordance	
rates	
are	
observed	
in	
monozygotic	
twins	
.	

The	
risk	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
two	
to	
six	
times	
greater	
for	
first	
-	
degree	
relatives	
of	
patients	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
than	
for	
those	
from	
the	
general	
population	
.	

Although	
an	
autosomal	
dominant	
model	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
sug-	
gested	
by	
many	
family	
studies	
,	
recent	
genomewide	
linkage	
and	
association	
studies	
suggest	
a	
more	
complex	
gene	
-	
environment	
pattern	
.	

Linkage	
analyses	
have	
reported	
several	
different	
gene	
loci	
associated	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
but	
,	
to	
date	
,	
no	
single	
causative	
gene	
.	

However	
,	
genomewide	
association	
studies	
have	
identified	
single	
nucleotide	
poly-	
morphisms	
in	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
four	
of	
which	
have	
been	
replicated	
:	
BTBD9	
,	
MEIS1	
,	
MAP2K5/	
LBXCOR	
,	
and	
PTPRD	
.	

Nonetheless	
,	
the	
relationship	
between	
familial	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
these	
findings	
remains	
to	
be	
determined	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
symptoms	
occurs	
at	
all	
ages	
,	
from	
childhood	
to	
late	
adult	
life	
.	

Mean	
age	
of	
onset	
for	
familial	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
in	
the	
third	
or	
fourth	
decade	
,	
with	
onset	
prior	
to	
age	
21	
years	
in	
about	
one	
third	
of	
cases	
.	

The	
clinical	
course	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
differs	
based	
on	
age	
of	
onset	
.	

In	
early	
-	
onset	
RLS	DISEASE
(	
before	
age	
45	
years	
)	
,	
slow	
progression	
of	
symptoms	
is	
found	
in	
about	
two	
thirds	
of	
cases	
.	

Most	
of	
the	
remaining	
one	
third	
report	
stable	
symp-	
toms	
over	
time	
,	
although	
remission	
has	
been	
described	
.	

In	
late	
-	
onset	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
rapid	
pro-	
gression	
is	
typical	
and	
aggravating	
factors	
are	
common	
.	

Significant	
impairment	
of	
health	
-	
related	
quality	
of	
life	
(	
HRQoL	
)	
has	
been	
found	
in	
moderate	
to	
severe	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Both	
physical	
health	
and	
mental	
health	
scores	
have	
consis-	
tently	
been	
found	
to	
be	
lower	
for	
individuals	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
using	
standard	
QoL	
assess-	
ment	
tools	
.	

The	
HRQoL	
impairments	
are	
strongly	
associated	
with	
severity	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
remain	
after	
controlling	
for	
age	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
disease	
comorbidity	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
patients	
with	
cancer	DISEASE
,	
type	
2	
diabetes	DISEASE
,	
or	
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
who	
also	
have	
RLS	DISEASE
have	
been	
shown	
to	
have	
poorer	
quality	
of	
life	
than	
those	
without	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Overall	
,	
RLS	DISEASE
accounts	
for	
a	
major	
disease	
burden	
on	
those	
who	
suffer	
from	
it	
,	
demonstrated	
to	
be	
similar	
to	
or	
worse	
than	
that	
associated	
with	
osteoarthritis	DISEASE
,	
congestive	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
,	
depression	DISEASE
,	
Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
or	
stroke	DISEASE
.	

Large	
population	
-	
based	
studies	
have	
found	
positive	
associations	
between	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
cardiovascular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
including	
coronary	DISEASE
heart	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
and	
stroke	DISEASE
.	

Repetitive	
surges	
in	
heart	
rate	
and	
blood	
pressure	
associated	
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
a	
potential	
mediator	
in	
the	
physiology	
of	
these	
relationships	
.	

Only	
limited	
mortality	
data	
are	
available	
,	
suggesting	
increased	
risk	
of	
mortality	
in	
women	
and	
in	
chronic	DISEASE
renal	DISEASE
failure	DISEASE
patients	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
The	
accurate	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
in	
children	
and	
adolescents	
requires	
understanding	
of	
developmental	
language	
and	
cognitive	
skills	
.	

Adequate	
verbal	
skills	
are	
needed	
for	
children	
to	
communicate	
the	
sensory	
component	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
description	
must	
be	
in	
“	
the	
child	
’s	
own	
words	
,	
”	
rather	
than	
by	
a	
parent	
or	
caretaker	
.	

For	
criterion	
A	
,	
children	
rarely	
use	
or	
understand	
the	
word	
“	
urge	
.	
”	

Instead	
they	
describe	
that	
their	
legs	
“	
need	
to	
”	
“	
have	
to	
”	
or	
“	
got	
to	
”	
move	
.	

Descriptors	
for	
the	
discomfort	
include	
:	
bugs	
,	
ants	
,	
weird/	
funny	
feelings	
,	
tingle	DISEASE
,	
wiggly	
,	
and	
shaky	
.	

Younger	
children	
often	
use	
the	
word	
“	
kick	
”	
rather	
than	
“	
move	
,	
”	
e.g.	
,	
“	
my	
legs	
want	
to	
kick	
.	
”	

Similar	
to	
adults	
,	
children	
report	
arm	
involvement	
in	
almost	
half	
of	
cases	
.	

Sitting	
in	
class	
,	
lying	
in	
bed	
,	
reading	
a	
book	
,	
and	
riding	
in	
a	
car	
are	
situations	
where	
children	
report	
onset	
or	
worsening	
of	
their	
symp-	
toms	
.	

Relief	
is	
typically	
achieved	
by	
moving	
around	
,	
walking	
,	
rubbing	
,	
kicking	
,	
or	
distraction	
.	

Perhaps	
as	
a	
result	
of	
prolonged	
periods	
of	
sitting	
in	
class	
,	
two	
thirds	
of	
children	
and	
adolescents	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
report	
daytime	DISEASE
leg	DISEASE
sensations	DISEASE
.	

Because	
of	
this	
,	
for	
diagnostic	
criterion	
A3	
(	
worse	
in	
the	
evening	
/	
night	
)	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
compare	
equal	
duration	
of	
sitting	
or	
lying	
down	
in	
the	
day	
to	
sitting	
or	
lying	
down	
in	
the	
evening/	
night	
.	

However	
,	
even	
with	
such	
comparisons	
,	
a	
significant	
subset	
of	
children	
do	
not	
report	
worsening	
at	
evening	
/	
night	
,	
yet	
meet	
all	
other	
diagnostic	
criteria	
and	
have	
sup-	
portive	
features	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
including	
a	
positive	
family	
history	
.	

Children	
who	
are	
age	
six	
years	
or	
older	
and	
developmentally	
normal	
have	
been	
shown	
to	
report	
detailed	
,	
ade-	
quate	
descriptors	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
symptoms	
.	

For	
children	
who	
are	
too	
young	
to	
adequately	
describe	
RLS	DISEASE
sensations	DISEASE
or	
are	
developmentally	
delayed	
,	
a	
PLMD	DISEASE
diagnosis	
may	
be	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
the	
initial	
diagnosis	
,	
with	
full	
RLS	
symptomatology	
evident	
over	
time	
.	

Diagnosis	
by	
observational	
techniques	
has	
been	
suggested	
but	
not	
yet	
validated	
.	

The	
differential	
diagnosis	
of	
pediatric	
RLS	DISEASE
includes	
positional	
discomfort	
,	
sore	DISEASE
leg	
muscles	
,	
joint	
/	
tendon	
injury	
,	
and	
bruises	
,	
all	
of	
which	
are	
common	
mimics	
.	

In	
child-	
hood	
,	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
frequently	
misdiagnosed	
as	
“	
growing	
pains	DISEASE
.	
”	

Four	
specific	
domains	
that	
are	
affected	
in	
pediatric	
RLS	DISEASE
are	
sleep	
,	
daily	
activities	
,	
mood	
,	
and	
energy	
/	
vital-	
ity	
.	

Difficulties	
with	
sleep	
onset	
,	
sleep	
maintenance	
,	
and	
sleep	
quality	
are	
common	
.	

Negative	
influence	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
on	
waking	
activities	
includes	
academic	
impact	
due	
to	
dis-	
ruption	
of	
schoolwork	
,	
homework	
,	
and	
ability	
to	
concentrate	
.	

Severity	
assessment	
of	
pediatric	
RLS	DISEASE
has	
thus	
far	
been	
limited	
to	
simple	
measures	
of	
self	
-	
reported	
frequency	
and	
intensity	
.	

Because	
pediatric	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
highly	
familial	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
in	
a	
first	
-	
degree	
rela-	
tive	DISEASE
helps	
to	
increase	
diagnostic	
certainty	
in	
childhood	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Similarly	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
or	
a	
history	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
is	
quite	
helpful	
in	
supporting	
an	
RLS	DISEASE
diagnosis	
in	
chil-	
dren	
.	

As	
in	
adults	
,	
approximately	
70	
%	
of	
children	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
demonstrate	
PLMS	DISEASE
≥	
5/	
hour	
on	
a	
single	
night	
and	
nearly	
90	
%	
when	
multiple	
nights	
are	
sampled	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
≥	
5/	
hour	
are	
uncommon	
in	
pediatric	
normative	
samples	
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
pediatric	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
comorbid	
with	
ADHD	DISEASE
in	
about	
one	
fourth	
of	
cases	
,	
and	
,	
as	
in	
adults	
,	
higher	
rates	
of	
anxiety	DISEASE
and	
depressive	DISEASE
symptoms	
are	
found	
.	

RLS	DISEASE
is	
common	
in	
pediatric	
chronic	DISEASE
kidney	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
.	

Prevalence	
rates	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
increase	
with	
age	
until	
late	
adulthood	
then	
stabilize	
or	
decrease	
slightly	
in	
the	
elderly	
.	

However	
,	
strong	
associations	
with	
anxiety	DISEASE
,	
mood	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
and	
decreased	
QoL	
measures	
remain	
in	
the	
elderly	
.	

Diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
in	
the	
cog-	
nitive	
-	
impaired	
elderly	
have	
been	
suggested	
but	
not	
validated	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Brain	
iron	CHEMICAL
deficiency	
,	
central	
nervous	
system	
dopamine	CHEMICAL
regulation	
,	
and	
genetics	
appear	
to	
be	
primary	
factors	
in	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Iron	CHEMICAL
is	
important	
in	
brain	
dopa-	
mine	
production	
and	
synaptic	
density	
,	
as	
well	
as	
in	
myelin	
synthesis	
and	
energy	
pro-	
duction	
.	

A	
connection	
between	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
low	
brain	
iron	CHEMICAL
is	
supported	
by	
autopsy	
data	
,	
MRI	
,	
brain	
sonography	
,	
and	
cerebrospinal	
fluid	
analysis	
.	

Evidence	
for	
central	
nervous	
system	
dopaminergic	
system	
involvement	
comes	
mainly	
from	
multiple	
randomized	
clinical	
trials	
that	
have	
clearly	
demonstrated	
the	
effect	
of	
dopaminergic	
drugs	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
an	
altered	
dopaminergic	
profile	
in	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
supported	
by	
func-	
tional	
MRI	
,	
positron	
emission	
tomography	
,	
and	
autopsy	
data	
.	

Association	
of	
gene	
vari-	
ants	
BTBD9	
,	
MEIS1	
,	
MAP2K5	
/	
LBXCOR	
,	
and	
PTPRD	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
has	
been	
replicated	
,	
indicating	
a	
genetic	
substrate	
upon	
which	
environmental	
factors	
might	
act	
.	

BTBD9	
is	
estimated	
to	
confer	
a	
population	
attributable	
risk	
(	
PAR	
)	
of	
50	
%	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Together	
,	
BTBD9	
,	
MEIS1	
,	
and	
MAP2K5	
/	
LBXCOR	
account	
for	
70	
%	
of	
the	
PAR	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
in	
indi-	
viduals	
with	
European	
ancestry	
.	

Thus	
far	
,	
two	
of	
the	
variants	
,	
BTBD9	
and	
MEIS1	
,	
appear	
to	
influence	
expression	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
,	
as	
well	
as	
iron	CHEMICAL
homeostasis	
.	

However	
,	
the	
full	
role	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
gene	
variants	
has	
not	
been	
adequately	
defined	
.	

Objective	
Findings	

Although	
polysomnography	
is	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
in	
the	
evaluation

PLMS	DISEASE
≥5

occur	
in	
70	
%	
to	
80	
%	
of	
adults	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
on	
single	
-	
night	
testing	
but	
in	
>	
90	
%	
when	
multiple	
nights	
are	
sampled	
.	

In	
adult	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
more	
prominent	
during	
the	
first	
half	
of	
the	
night	
and	
vary	
in	
frequency	
from	
night	
to	
night	
.	

About	
one	
third	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
associated	
with	
cortical	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
,	
and	
most	
have	
associated	
autonomic	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
are	
not	
influenced	
by	
placebo	
effect	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
contribute	
to	
the	
primary	
RLS	
morbidity	
of	
sleep	
dis-	
turbance	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
RLS	DISEASE
sensory	
symptoms	
impair	
return	
to	
sleep	
,	
and	
thereby	
result	
in	
more	
prolonged	
awakening	
.	

The	
Suggested	
Immobilization	
Test	
(	
SIT	
)	
evaluates	
PLMW	
and	
related	
sensory	
com-	
ponents	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
during	
resting	
wakefulness	
.	

A	
standard	
polysomnogram	
recording	
without	
respiratory	
measures	
is	
used	
for	
one	
hour	
before	
the	
usual	
bedtime	
while	
the	
subject	
sits	
comfortably	
awake	
and	
upright	
in	
bed	
with	
the	
legs	
outstretched	
.	

RLS	DISEASE
diagnosis	
is	
supported	
by	
a	
finding	
of	
more	
than	
40	
PLMW	
/	
hour	
.	

Activity	
monitors	
with	
high	
-	
frequency	
sampling	
and	
body	
-	
position	
monitoring	
may	
be	
attached	
to	
the	
ankle	
or	
foot	
to	
provide	
an	
alternate	
measure	
of	
PLMs	
.	

Recordings	
assess	
the	
frequency	
and	
variability	
of	
PLMs	
from	
night	
to	
night	
,	
typically	
over	
three	
to	
five	
nights	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	

The	
differentiation	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
from	
other	
conditions	
that	
may	
have	
characteristics	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
essential	
,	
because	
approximately	
40	
%	
of	
individuals	
without	
RLS	DISEASE
will	
report	
some	
urge	
or	
need	
to	
move	
the	
legs	
while	
at	
rest	
.	

Fulfilling	
diagnostic	
criteria	
A2	
(	
better	
with	
movement	
)	
and	
A3	
(	
worse	
in	
the	
evening	
/	
night	
)	
improves	
specificity	
for	
an	
RLS	DISEASE
diagnosis	
to	
only	
about	
70	
%	
,	
based	
on	
studies	
that	
have	
used	
structured	
diagnostic	
interviews	
.	

However	
,	
differentiating	
RLS	DISEASE
from	
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
and	
positional	
discomfort	
improves	
specificity	
to	
94	
%	
,	
emphasizing	
the	
importance	
of	
differential	
diagnosis	
.	

The	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
most	
important	
“	
mimics	
”	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
are	
leg	
cramps	
,	
positional	
discomfort	
,	
arthralgias/	
arthritis	DISEASE
,	
myalgias	DISEASE
,	
leg	DISEASE
edema	DISEASE
,	
peripheral	DISEASE
neuropathy	DISEASE
,	
radiculopathy	DISEASE
,	
and	
habitual	
foot	
tapping	
.	

Not	
characteristic	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
are	
:	
“	
knotting	
”	
of	
the	
muscle	
(	
cramps	DISEASE
)	
,	
relief	
with	
a	
single	
postural	
shift	
(	
positional	
discomfort	
)	
,	
limitation	
to	
joints	
(	
arthritis	DISEASE
)	
,	
sore-	
ness	
to	
palpation	
(	
myalgias	DISEASE
)	
,	
and	
other	
abnormalities	
on	
physical	
examination	
.	

Less	
common	
conditions	
to	
be	
differentiated	
from	
RLS	DISEASE
include	
neuroleptic	
-	
induced	
akathi-	

sia	
,	
myelopathy	DISEASE
,	
symptomatic	
venous	DISEASE
insufficiency	DISEASE
,	
peripheral	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
eczema	DISEASE
,	
orthopedic	
problems	
,	
painful	
legs	
and	
moving	
toes	
,	
and	
anxiety	DISEASE
-	
induced	
restlessness	
.	

Neuroleptic	
-	
induced	
akathisia	DISEASE
differs	
from	
RLS	DISEASE
in	
that	
akathisia	DISEASE
is	
associated	
with	
the	
need	
to	
move	
the	
entire	
body	
and	
occurs	
in	
association	
with	
use	
of	
dopamine	CHEMICAL
-	
receptor	
antagonists	
.	

Painful	
legs	
and	
moving	
toes	
have	
neither	
a	
clear	
circadian	
pattern	
nor	
the	
sense	
of	
an	
urge	
to	
move	
.	

Pain	DISEASE
involving	
the	
legs	
occurs	
with	
numerous	
conditions	
,	
including	
arthritis	DISEASE
,	
vascular	
problems	
,	
sports	
/	
orthopedic	
injuries	DISEASE
,	
and	
neuropathy	DISEASE
.	

These	
pains	DISEASE
can	
have	
a	
nocturnal	
presentation	
and	
may	
be	
worse	
at	
rest	
,	
but	
improvement	
with	
movement	
either	
does	
not	
occur	
or	
entails	
more	
exercise	
than	
simple	
movement	
of	
the	
leg	
.	

The	
urge	
to	
move	
,	
if	
present	
at	
all	
,	
usually	
stems	
from	
awareness	
that	
movement	
produces	
relief	
rather	
than	
the	
strong	
primary	
urgency	
of	
movement	
felt	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

The	
presence	
of	
pain	DISEASE
,	
however	
,	
does	
not	
exclude	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
because	
about	
50	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
report	
their	
RLS	DISEASE
symptoms	
as	
painful	
.	

Although	
it	
is	
important	
that	
RLS	DISEASE
symptoms	
not	
be	
attributable	
solely	
to	
another	
medical	
or	
behavioral	
condition	
,	
it	
should	
also	
be	
appreciated	
that	
any	
of	
these	
mimics	
can	
occur	
in	
an	
individual	
who	
also	
has	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

For	
example	
,	
some	
subjects	
may	
have	
both	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
leg	
cramps	
.	

When	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
not	
certain	
,	
evaluation	
for	
the	
supportive	
features	
such	
as	
the	
presence	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
or	
a	
family	
history	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
may	
be	
helpful	
.	

Diagnostic	
interviews	
that	
include	
differential	
diagnosis	
have	
been	
validated	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

These	
demonstrate	
sensitivity	
and	
specificity	
of	
>	
90	
%	
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

The	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
relies	
on	
the	
subjective	
report	
of	
sensory	
symptoms	
that	
lie	
outside	
the	
range	
of	
common	
sensory	
experience	
.	

Many	
patients	
have	
difficulty	
describing	
the	
sensations	
.	

Further	
studies	
of	
the	
biological	
bases	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
may	
lead	
to	
better	
classification	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
possibly	
to	
objective	
tests	
for	
diagnosis	
.	

Iron	CHEMICAL
,	
dopa-	
mine	
,	
and	
genetic	
research	
hold	
particular	
promise	
.	

Additional	
epidemiological	
and	
genetic	
studies	
outside	
the	
US	
and	
Europe	
are	
needed	
to	
explore	
apparent	
population	
differences	
.	

The	
diagnostic	
standards	
and	
severity	
assessment	
for	
children	
and	
cogni-	
tively	
impaired	
adults	
require	
further	
development	
.	

Clarification	
of	
the	
natural	
course	
and	
potential	
exacerbating	
factors	
is	
needed	
.	

Better	
understanding	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
with	
comor-	DISEASE
bidities	DISEASE
such	DISEASE
as	DISEASE
mood	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
and	
attention	DISEASE
deficit	DISEASE
hyperactivity	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
might	
lead	
to	
improved	
outcomes	
in	
those	
disorders	
.	

Further	
evaluation	
of	
long	
-	
term	
complica-	
tions	
is	
important	
,	
including	
clarification	
of	
associations	
with	
hypertension	DISEASE
,	
cardiovas-	
cular	
disease	
,	
and	
stroke	DISEASE

Notes	
.	

The	
PLMS	DISEASE
Index	
must	
be	
interpreted	
in	
the	
context	
of	
a	
patient	
’s	
sleep	
related	
complaint	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
normative	
values	
greater	
than	
five	
per	
hour	
have	
been	
found	
in	
studies	
that	
did	
not	
exclude	
respiratory	
event	
-	
related	
arousals	DISEASE
(	
using	
sensitive	
respiratory	
monitoring	
)	
and	
other	
causes	
for	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Data	
suggest	
a	
partial	
overlap	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
Index	
values	
between	
symptomatic	
and	
asymptomatic	
individuals	
,	
emphasizing	
the	
importance	
of	
clinical	
context	
over	
an	
absolute	
cutoff	
value	
.	
.	

If	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
present	
without	
clinical	
sleep	
disturbance	
or	
daytime	DISEASE
impairment	DISEASE
,	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
can	
be	
noted	
as	
a	
polysomnographic	
finding	
,	
but	
criteria	
are	
not	
met	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
.	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
or	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
is	
not	
sufficient	
to	
establish	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
.	

Studies	
have	
shown	
that	
in	
most	
cases	
the	
cause	
of	
the	
accompanying	
insomnia	DISEASE
or	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
is	
something	
other	
than	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

To	
establish	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
,	
it	
is	
essential	
to	
establish	
a	
reasonable	
cause	
-	
and	
-	
effect	
relationship	
between	
the	
insomnia	DISEASE
or	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
and	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

This	
requires	
that	
other	
causes	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
such	
as	
anxiety	DISEASE
or	
other	
causes	
of	
hypersomnia	DISEASE
such	
as	
obstructive	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
or	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
are	
ruled	
out	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
are	
common	
,	
but	
PLMD	DISEASE
is	
thought	
to	
be	
rare	
in	
adults	
.	
.	

PLMD	DISEASE
can	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
in	
the	
context	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
untreated	
obstructive	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
,	
or	
REM	
sleep	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
;	
PLMS	DISEASE
occur	
commonly	
in	
these	
conditions	
but	
the	
sleep	
complaint	
is	
more	
readily	
ascribed	
to	
the	
accompanying	
disorder	
.	

The	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
takes	
precedence	
over	
that	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
when	
potentially	
sleep-	
disrupting	
PLMS	DISEASE
occur	
in	
the	
context	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

In	
such	
cases	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
is	
made	
and	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
noted	
.	
.	

When	
it	
is	
reasonably	
certain	
that	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
have	
been	
induced	
by	
medication	
,	
and	
full	
criteria	
for	
PLMD	DISEASE
are	
met	
,	
it	
is	
preferred	
that	
the	
more	
specific	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
be	
used	
,	
rather	
than	
“	
Sleep	
related	
movement	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
due	
to	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
.	
”	

Essential	
Features	
PLMD	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
periodic	
episodes	
of	
repetitive	
,	
highly	
stereotyped	
limb	
movements	
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
(	
PLMS	DISEASE
)	
,	
in	
conjunction	
with	
clinical	
sleep	
dis-	
turbance	
or	
fatigue	DISEASE
that	
can	
not	
be	
accounted	
for	
by	
another	
primary	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
or	
other	
etiology	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
occur	
most	
frequently	
in	
the	
lower	
extremities	
.	

They	
typically	
involve	
exten-	
sion	
of	
the	
big	
toe	
,	
often	
in	
combination	
with	
partial	
flexion	
of	
the	
ankle	
,	
the	
knee	
,	
and	
sometimes	
,	
the	
hip	
.	

Similar	
movements	
can	
occur	
in	
the	
upper	
limbs	
.	

Individual	
movements	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
autonomic	
arousal	
,	
a	
cortical	
arousal	
,	
or	
an	
awakening	
.	

Typically	
,	
the	
patient	
is	
unaware	
of	
the	
limb	
movements	
or	
the	
frequent	
sleep	
disruption	
.	

An	
arousal	
may	
precede	
,	
coincide	
with	
,	
or	
follow	
the	
limb	
movement	
,	
suggesting	
that	
a	
central	
generator	
may	
give	
rise	
to	
both	
the	
periodic	
movements	
and	
the	
related	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
.	

A	
clinical	
history	
of	
sleep	
onset	
problems	
,	
sleep	
maintenance	
problems	
,	
or	
unrefresh-	
ing	
sleep	
attributable	
to	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
is	
needed	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
.	

These	
symp-	
toms	
have	
most	
consistently	
been	
associated	
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
,	
and	
the	
presence	
of	
these	
clinical	
symptoms	
differentiates	
PLMD	DISEASE
from	
asymptomatic	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Although	
exces-	
sive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
with	
PLMD	DISEASE
in	
the	
past	
,	
newer	
data	
do	
not	
find	
significantly	
elevated	
Epworth	
Sleepiness	
Scale	
scores	
or	
Multiple	
Sleep	
Latency	
Test	
(	
MSLT	
)	
values	
in	
subjects	
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

If	
the	
only	
complaint	
is	
sleep	
disruption	
for	
the	
bed	
partner	
,	
then	
PLMD	DISEASE
should	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
but	
the	
sleep	
disturbance	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
can	
be	
noted	
.

The	
PLMS	DISEASE
index	
should	
exceed	
five	
per	
hour	
in	
children	
and	
15	
per	
hour	
in	
adult	
cases	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
.	

This	
is	
based	
on	
substantial	
normative	
data	
in	
children	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
there	
is	
a	
significant	
increase	
in	
sleep	DISEASE

symptoms	
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
>	
15

.	

The	
PLMS	DISEASE
and	
the	
symptoms	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
or	
nonrestorative	
sleep	
should	
not	
be	
better	
explained	
by	
another	
etiology	
.	

Most	
important	
in	
the	
differential	
diagnosis	
are	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
REM	
sleep	DISEASE
behavior	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
RBD	DISEASE
)	
,	
and	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
.	

Research	
studies	
indicate	
that	
five	
or	
more	
PLMS	DISEASE
per	
hour	
occur	
in	
80	
%	
to	
90	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
in	
about	
70	
%	
with	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
and	
in	
45	
%	
to	
65	
%	
with	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
.	

In	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
often	
present	
without	
arousals	DISEASE
during	
nonrapid	
eye

sleep	
(	
NREM

sleep	
but	
can	
also	
con-	
tinue	
into	
REM	
sleep	
,	
which	
is	
unusual	
in	
all	
other	
settings	
.	

If	
significant	
daytime	
sleep-	
iness	
and	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
present	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
should	
be	
considered	
.	

PLMD	DISEASE
should	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
when	
criteria	
for	
one	
of	
these	
three	
disorders	
is	
met	
.	

However	
,	
the	
primary	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
“	
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
”	
can	
be	
specified	
(	
e.g.	
,	
“	
RLS	DISEASE
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
”	
)	
.	

A	
sensitive	
technique	
,	
such	
as	
pressure	
transducer	
airflow	
monitoring	
or	
esophageal	
manometry	
,	
should	
be	
used	
to	
monitor	
breathing	
during	
polysomnography	
to	
rea-	
sonably	
exclude	
sleep	
related	
breathing	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
(	
SRBDs	DISEASE
)	
as	
the	
direct	
cause	
of	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

When	
independent	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
present	
in	
patients	
with	
SRBDs	DISEASE
,	
a	
separate	
diag-	
nosis	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
may	
be	
considered	
if	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
persist	
despite	
adequate	
treatment	
of	
the	
SRBD	
and	
otherwise	
unexplained	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
remains	
.	

Ideally	
,	
polysom-	
nography	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
should	
be	
performed	
after	
the	
biologic	
effect	
of	
a	
medication	
or	
substance	
,	
such	
as	
an	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
known	
to	
induce

In	
children	
with	
PLMD	DISEASE

a

is	
common

A

supportive	
of	
the

Although	
PLMD	DISEASE

may	
be	
responsive	
to	
benzodiazepines	CHEMICAL
,	
benzodiazepine	CHEMICAL
responsiveness	
is	
not	
support-	
i

Although

is	
thought	
to	
be	
rare	
,	
the	
exact	
prevalence	
is	
not	
known	
.	

PLMD	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
in	
both	
children	
and	
adults	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE

are	
very	
uncommon	
in	
children	
and	
adults	
younger	
than	
the	
age	
of	
40	
years	
,	
but	
then	
increase	
markedly	
with	
advancing	
age	
,	
occurring	
in	
over	
45	
%	
of	
the	
elderly	
.	

The	
population	
prevalence	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
>	
15

has	
been	
estimated	
at	
7.6	
%	
of	
18-

65	
-	
year

olds	
,	
with	
4.5	
%	
of	
the	
total	
population	
also	
reporting	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
or	
excessive	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
medication	
-	
induced	
PLMS	DISEASE
were	
not	
exclusionary	
criteria	
in	
this	
popula-	
tion	
,	
suggesting	
much	
lower	
rates	
for	
PLMD	DISEASE
.	

The	
increase	
in	
PLMS	DISEASE
with	
age	
may	
occur	
as	
a	
partial	
expression	
of	
familial	
or	
genetic	
factors	
associated	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
based	
on	
data	
that	
show	
very	
little	
increase	
in	
PLMS	DISEASE
with	
age	
when	
individuals	
who	
have	
RLS	DISEASE
or	
first

relatives	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
are	
excluded	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
are

No

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
A	
positive	
family	
history	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
confers	
increased	
risk	
for	
PLMS	DISEASE
and	
PLMD	DISEASE
.	

The	
genetic	
variants	
noted	
below	
may	
be	
a	
mediator	
of	
this	
risk	
.	

Precipitation	
or	
aggrava-	
tion	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
has	
been	
reported	
with	
the	
use	
of	
several	
medications	
.	

Selective	
sero-	
tonin

inhibitor	
antidepressants	CHEMICAL
,	
tricyclic	
antidepressants	CHEMICAL
,	
lithium	CHEMICAL
,	
and	
dopa-	
mine	
receptor	
antagonists	
have	
most	
often	
been	
associated	
with	
this	
effect	
.	

Low	
brain	
iron	CHEMICAL
,	
as	
reflected	
by	
serum	
ferritin	
level	
,	
may	
worsen	
PLMS	DISEASE
via

Familial	
Patterns	

The	
familial	
pattern	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
has	
not	
been	
studied	
in	
detail	
.	

Families	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
have	
been	
found	
to	
include	
first	
-	
degree	
relatives	
without	
RLS	DISEASE
but	
with	
increased	
rates	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
or	
PLMD	DISEASE
,	
raising	
the	
possibility	
that	
PLMD	DISEASE
is	
an	
attenuated	
manifestation	
or	
a	
precursor	
to	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

The	
gene	
variants	
BTBD9	
and	
MEIS1	
,	
which	
were	
found	
in	
genome-	
wide	
studies	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
appear	
to	
influence	
the	
expression	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE

Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Although	
the	
typical	
age	
of	
onset	
is	
not	
known	
,	
PLMD	DISEASE
occurs	
in	
both	
children	
and	
adults	
,	
with	
onset	
as	
early	
as	
infancy	
.	

The	
natural	
history	
has	
not	
been	
described	
in	
detail	
,	
but	
some	
pediatric	
cases	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
progress	
to	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Incidence	
and	
remission	
rates	
are	
unknown	
.	

Impaired	
performance	
in	
a	
simulated	
driving	
task	
has	
been	
found	
in	
patients	
with	
PLMD	DISEASE
.	

Increased	
PLMS	DISEASE
have	
been	
associated	
with	
a	
higher	
risk	
of	
cardiovascular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
stroke	DISEASE
,	
and	
mortality	
in	
some	
studies	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
-	
related	
overac-	
tivity	
of

for	
these	
associations

Sleep

Developmental	
Issues	
Given	
the	
low	
background	
rates	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
in	
children	
,	
PLMD	DISEASE
has	
emerged	
as	
a	
useful	
diagnostic	
category	
in	
pediatric	
sleep	
medicine	
.	

Pediatric	
PLMD	DISEASE
has	
important	

clini-	

cal	

and	
polysomnographic	
correlates	
that	
are	
comparable	
in	
severity	
to	
pediatric	
OSA	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
PLMS	DISEASE
and	
PLMD	DISEASE
normative	
data	
remain	
sparse	
for	
children	
younger	
than	
two	
years	
.	

In	
the	
elderly	
,	
frequent	
occurrence	
of	
other	
conditions	
that	
can	
account	
for	
sleep	
dis-	

turbance	
and	
fatigue	DISEASE
makes	
application	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
criteria	
difficult	
,	
even	
though	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
common	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Dopaminergic	
impairment	DISEASE
has	
been	
implicated	
in	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
and	
PLMD	DISEASE
.	

The	
study	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
in	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
in	
children	
also	
suggests	
genetic	
diathesis	DISEASE
and	
iron	CHEMICAL
status	
as	
factors	
.	

Cyclic	
alternating	
pattern	
,	
a	
marker	
of	
nonrestorative	DISEASE
sleep	
,	
is	
increased	
in	
individuals	
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
and	
may	
influence	
the	
periodicity	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Cortical	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
can	
precede	
,	
coincide	
with	
,	
or	
follow	
PLMS	DISEASE
,	
indicating	
that	
PLMS	DISEASE
do	
not	
cause	
the	
arousals	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
PLMS	DISEASE
can	
be	
dissociated	
from	
arousals	DISEASE
pharma-	
cologically	
,	
suggesting	
an	
indirect	
relation	
,	
possibly	
mediated	
by	
a	
central	
generator	
.	

The	
autonomic	
arousals	DISEASE
associated	
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
characterized	
by	
significant	
heart	
rate	
and	
blood	
pressure	
surges	
,	
a	
mechanism	
for	
possible	
increased	
cardiovascular	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
cerebrovascular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
risk	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
PLMS	DISEASE
can	
appear	
immediately	
with	
the	
onset	
of	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
,	
are	
frequent	
during	
stage	
N2	
sleep	
,	
decrease	
in	
frequency	
in	
stage	
N3	
,	
and	
are	
usually	
absent	
during	
stage	
R	
sleep	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
typically	
occur	
in	
discrete	
episodes	
that	
last	
from	
a	
few	
minutes	
to	
an	
hour	
.	

Both	
lower	
limbs	
should	
be	
monitored	
for	
the	
presence	
of	
limb	
movements	
.	

Movements	
of	
the	
upper	
limbs	
may	
be	
sampled	
if	
clinically	
indicated	
.	

The	
anterior	
tibialis	
electro-	
myogram	
(	
EMG	
)	
shows	
repetitive	
contractions	
,	
each	
lasting	
0.5	
to	
10	
seconds	
.	

The	
movements	
may	
affect	
one	
or	
,	
more	
typically	
,	
both	
of	
the	
lower	
limbs	
,	
but	
not	
neces-	
sarily	
in	
a	
symmetric	
or	
simultaneous	
pattern	
.	

Specific	
scoring	
criteria	
for	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
described	
in	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated	
Events	
.	

Self	
-	
reports	
,	
bed	
partner	
observations	
,	
or	
parental	
reports	
for	
children	
have	
not	
been	
found	
to	
have	
sufficient	
specificity	
or	
sensitivity	
to	
replace	
objective	
testing	
for	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Care	
must	
be	
taken	
to	
discriminate	
PLMS	DISEASE
from	
other	
movements	
such	
as	
a	
simple	
change	
in	
body	
position	
,	
stretching	
of	
a	
limb	
,	
or	
a	
muscle	DISEASE
cramp	DISEASE
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
are	
longer	
in	
duration	
than	
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
,	
which	
,	
by	
definition	
,	
are	
typically	
50	
to	
150	
millisec-	
onds	
long	
.	

Movements	
associated	
with	
respiratory	
events	
,	
hypnagogic	
foot	
tremor	DISEASE
,	
or	
alternating	
leg	
muscle	
activation	
during	
sleep	
(	
ALMA	
)	
should	
not	
be	
included	
in	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
index	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
may	
be	
associated	
with	
electroencephalographic	
(	
cortical	
)	
arousals	DISEASE
or	
with	
awakenings	
.	

Autonomic	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE

by	
a	
change	
in	
heart	
rate	
,	
blood

,	
or	
pulse	
transit	
time	
—	
have	
been	
shown	
to	
be	
more	
frequent	
than	
cortical	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
periodic	
arousals	DISEASE
may	
persist	
even	
though	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
have	
subsided	
.	

The	
arousals	DISEASE
are	
typically	
more	
difficult	
to	
measure	
than	
are	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
,	
and	
their	
clinical	
significance	
is	
a	
topic	
of	
ongoing	
debate	
.	

As	
with	
obstructive	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
,	
the	
associated	
cortical	
arousal	
index	
has	
not	
proven	
more	
useful	
than	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
index	
in	
making	
clini-	
cal	
decisions	
.	

Although	
a	
subjective	
report	
of	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
is	
present	
in	
some	
patients	
with	
PLMD	DISEASE
,	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
measured	
by	
MSLT	
has	
not	
been	
found	
to	
be	
consistently	
abnormal	
or	
to	
correlate	
with	
the	
PLMS	
cortical	
arousal	
index	
.	

The	
movements	
should	
be	
reported	
as	
an	
index	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
,	
called	
the	
PLMS	DISEASE
index	
.	

The	
PLMS	DISEASE
index	
is	
the	
number	
of	
periodic	
limb	
movements	
per	
hour	
of	
total	
sleep	
time	
,	
as	
determined	
by	
polysomnography	
.	

The	
PLMS	DISEASE
arousal	
index	
is	
the	
number	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
associated	
with	
a	
cortical	
arousal	
,	
expressed	
per	
hour	
of	
total	
sleep

.	

Other	
parameters	
for	
the	
description	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE

Differential	
Diagnosis	
As	
described	
in	
the	
essential	
features	
section	
,	
PLMD	DISEASE
is	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
exclusion	
and	
it	
is	
important	
to	
differentiate	
it	
from	
other	
conditions	
in	
which	
PLMS	DISEASE
occur	
,	
particularly	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
and	
SRBDs	DISEASE
.	

Increased	
rates	
of

have	
also

Dopaminergic	
impairment	
and/or	
diminished	
inhibition	
of	
the	
central	
pattern	
generator	
for	
PLMS	DISEASE
have	
been	
proposed	
as	
common	
factors	
linking	
various	
disorders	
and	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
starts	
(	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
)	
need	
to	
be	
differentiated	
from	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
starts	
typically	
are	
limited	
to	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
,	
are	
not	
periodic	
,	
and	
are	
briefer	
(	
20	
to	
100	
milliseconds	
)	
than	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Normal	
phasic	
REM	
activity	
is	
limited	
to	
REM	
sleep	
,	
typically	
occurs	
in	
5-	
to	
15	
-	
second	
clusters	
,	
and	
is	
usually	
associated	
with	
bursts	
of	
REMs	DISEASE
.	

Phasic	
REM	
EMG	
twitches	
are	
more	
variable	
in	
duration	
and	
do	
not	
have	
the	
periodicity	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
EMG	
activity	
that	
is	
briefer	
(	
75	
to	
150	
milliseconds	
)	
,	
more	
variable	
in	
duration	
,	
less	
periodic	
than	
PLMS	DISEASE
,	
and	
has	
little	
or	
no	
associated	
visible	
movement	
.	

Also	
,	
PLMS	DISEASE
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
movements	
associated	
with	
nocturnal	DISEASE
epileptic	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
and	
myoclonic	DISEASE
epilepsy	DISEASE
and	
from	
a	
number	
of	
forms	
of	
myoclonus	DISEASE
seen	
while	
awake	
,	
such	
as	
in	
Alzheimer	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
Creutzfeldt	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
Jakob	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
and	
other	
neuropathologic	
conditions	
.	

However	
,	
in	
these	
disorders	
,	
the	
involuntary	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
are	
prominent	
during	
the	
daytime	
,	
often	
do	
not	
disappear	
with	
activity	
,	
are	
prominent	
in	
the	
arms	
and	
other	
body	
parts	
in	
addition	
to	
the	
legs	
,	
and	
do	
not	
display	
the	
periodicity	
seen	
with	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
has	
been	
controversy	
over	
the	
clinical	
significance	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

To	
date	
,	
the	
inter-	
pretation	
of	
most	
studies	
has	
been	
confounded	
by	
multiple	
factors	
that	
include	
:	
impre-	
cise	
diagnostic	
criteria	
;	
confusion	DISEASE
between	
PLMS	DISEASE
and	
PLMD	DISEASE
;	
inadequate	
monitoring	
for	
subtle	
SRBDs	DISEASE
;	
a	
lack	
of	
consideration	
of	
medications	
known	
to	
induce	
,	
worsen	
,	
or	
suppress	
PLMS	DISEASE
;	
and	
inadequate	
measurement	
of	
the	
known	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
vari-	
ability	
of	
PLMS	DISEASE
.	

Newer	
respiratory	
monitoring	
techniques	
for	
polysomnography	
and	
the	
use	
of	
actigraphy	
monitors	
over	
several	
nights	
should	
help	
address	
a	
number	
of	
these	
issues	
.	

The	
role	
of	
associated	
arousals	DISEASE
in	
relation	
to	
clinical	
symptoms	
is	
yet	
to	
be	
determined	
,	
but	
the	
appreciation	
of	
autonomic	
arousals	DISEASE
as	
well	
as	
cortical	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
might	
be	
critical	
.	

It	
is	
possible	
that	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
a	
measurable	
marker	
of	
unstable	
sleep	
,	
related	
to	
genetic	
diathesis	DISEASE
and	
dopaminergic	
impairment	
.

with	
sudden	
,	
involuntary	DISEASE

,	
indicating	
a	
strong	
muscle

B.	
The	
painful	DISEASE
muscle	DISEASE

occur	
during	
the	
time	
in

,	
although	
they	
may	
arise	
from	
either	
wakefulness	
or	
sleep	
.	

C.	

The	
pain	DISEASE
is	
relieved	
by	
forceful	
stretching	
of	
the	
affected	
muscles	
,	
thus	
releasing	
the	
contraction	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
are	
painful	DISEASE
sensations	DISEASE
caused	
by	
sudden	
and	
intense	
involun-	
tary	
contractions	
of	
muscles	
or	
muscle	
groups	
during	
which	
there	
is	
muscle	DISEASE
spasm	DISEASE
and	
hardness	DISEASE
for	
several	
seconds	
.	

These	
painful	DISEASE
sensations	DISEASE
are	
usually	
in	
the	
calf	
or	
small	
muscle	
of	
the	
foot	
.	

Occurring	
during	
the	
time	
in	
bed	
,	
sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
may	
arise	
from	
either	
wakefulness	
or	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	DISEASE
related	DISEASE
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
usually	
start	
abruptly	
but	
may	
in	
some	
cases	
be	
preceded	
by	
a	
less	
painful	DISEASE
warning	DISEASE
sensation	DISEASE
.	

The	
muscle	
contractions	
last	
for	
a	
few	
seconds	
up	
to	
several	
minutes	
and	
then	
remit	
spontaneously	
.	

The	
frequency	
of	
sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	
varies	
considerably	
from	
less	
than	
yearly	
to	
multiple	
episodes	
every	
night	
.	

Sleep

Movement	
Disorders	

The	
cramps	DISEASE
can	
be	
relieved	
by	
strongly	
stretching	
the	
affected	
muscle	
and	
sometimes	
also	
by	
local	
massage	
,	
application	
of	
heat	
,	
or	
movement	
of	
the	
affected	
limb	
.	

Leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
can	
be	
present	
primarily	
during

Associated	
Features	
The	
muscle	DISEASE
cramp	DISEASE
affects	
sleep	
.	

The	
pain	DISEASE
from	
the	
cramp	DISEASE
itself	
and	
from	
the	
activities	
used	
to	
relieve	
it	
commonly	
disturb	
sleep	
onset	
or	
cause	
an	
awakening	
from	
sleep	
.	

Often	
the	
presenting	
complaint	
is	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
at	
times	
severe	
.	

Tenderness	DISEASE
and	
discomfort	
in	
the	
muscle	
may	
persist	
for	
several	
hours	
after	
the	
cramp-	
ing	
.	

Persisting	
discomfort	
after	
the	
cramping	DISEASE
episode	
often	
delays	
subsequent	
return	
to	
sleep	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
are	
known	
to	
be	
either	
idiopathic	DISEASE
or	
secondary	
to	
other	
medical	
conditions	
,	
but	
there	
have	
been	
no	
indications	
of	
significant	
differences	
in	
the	
clinical	
features	
of	
the	
disorder	
related	
to	
the	
cause	
.	

Demographics	
Sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
are	
common	
.	

It	
has	
been	
suggested	
that	
nearly	
every	
adult	
older	
than	
50	
years	
has	
experienced	
sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
at	
least	
once	
.	

Both	
the	
prevalence	
and	
the	
frequency	
of	
the

increase	
with

Course	
and	
Complications	
Sleep

leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
have	
not	
been	
reported	
in	
infancy	
,	
nor	
in	
children	
younger	
than	
eight	
years	
.	

The	
peak	
onset	
is	
usually	
in	
adulthood	
,	
but	
the	
condition	
may	
be	
seen	
for	
the	
first	
time	
in

The	
natural	
history	
of	
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
is	
not	
well	
under-

Many	
patients	
describe	
a	
waxing

of	
many	
years

Complications	
include	
muscle	DISEASE
tenderness	DISEASE

and	
occasional

alone	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Many	
sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
appear	
to	
be	
idiopathic	DISEASE
.	

Although	
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
involve	
abnormal	
muscle	
tone	
,	
they	
are	
generally	
considered	
not	
to	
involve	
agonist	
-	
antagonist	
co	
-	
contractions	
and	
,	
thus	
,	
are	
not	
classified	
as	
dystonias	DISEASE
.	

Some	
nocturnal	DISEASE
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
,	
particularly	
those	
in	
the	
feet	
,	
may	
resemble	
dystonias	DISEASE
but	
,	
unlike	
classic	
dystonias	DISEASE
,	
sleep	
related	
leg	
and	
foot	
cramps	DISEASE
are	
relieved	
by	
stretching	
the	
affected	
muscle	
or	
muscles	
.	

Electrophysiologic	
recordings	
show	
that	
the	
cramps	DISEASE
typically	
start	
with	
spontaneous	
firing	
of	
anterior	
horn	
cells	
followed	
by	
motor	
unit	
discharges	
for	
contractions	
at	
rates	
up	
to	
300	
Hz	
(	
considerably	
more	
than	
with	
voluntary	DISEASE
muscle	DISEASE
contractions	DISEASE
)	
.	

The	
pain	DISEASE
may	
result	
from	
local	
metabolite	
accumulations	
or	
from	
local	
ischemia	DISEASE
.	

Muscle	
and	
tendon	
shortening	
due	
to	
age	
or	
lack	
of	
stretching	
exercise	
is	
thought	
to	
contribute	
to	
the	
development	
of	
sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
.	

Exercise	
involving	
stretch-	
ing	
the	
affected	
muscles	
is	
thought	
to	
help	
prevent	
or	
reduce	
the	
occurrence	
of	
sleep	
related

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnographic	
studies	
of	
patients	
with	
chronic	
sleep	DISEASE
related	DISEASE
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
reveal	
non-	
periodic	
bursts	
of	
gastrocnemius	
EMG	
activity	
.	

Episodes	
arise	
from	
sleep	
without	
any	
specific	
preceding	
physiologic	
changes	
during	
sleep	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
are	
common	
in	
chronic	
myelopathy	DISEASE
,	
peripheral	DISEASE
neuropathy	DISEASE
,	
muscular	DISEASE
pain	DISEASE
fasciculation	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
and	
disorders	
of	
calcium	CHEMICAL
metabolism	
.	

These	
causes	
should	
be	
differentiated	
by	
clinical	
history	
and	
physical	
examination	
.	

RLS	DISEASE
is	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
sometimes	
confused	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
related	DISEASE
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
because	
both	
can	
present	
with	
leg	
discomfort	
during	
the	
sleep	
period	
and	
RLS	DISEASE
patients	
sometimes	
complain	
of	
a	
cramping	DISEASE
sensation	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
if	
patients	
meet	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
do	
not	
describe	
an	
actual	
cramp	DISEASE
or	
hardening	
of	
the	
muscle	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
should	
be	
RLS	DISEASE
.	

Because	
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
can	
mimic	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
meet	
all	
the	
criteria	
for	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
the	
description	
of	
an	
actual	
spasm	DISEASE
or	
hardening	
of	
the	
muscle	
is	
a	
critical	
differentiating	
factor	
.	

A	
leg	
cramp	DISEASE
is	
also	
a	
much	
briefer	
event	
than	
the	
typical	
symptoms	
of	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
which	
can	
persist	
for	
hours	
.	

However	
,	
RLS	DISEASE
and	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
may	
sometimes	
be	
seen	
in	
the	
same	
individual	
.	

Dystonia	DISEASE
is	
ongoing	
daily	
spasm	DISEASE
of	
muscles	
and	
is	
distinguished	
electrophysiologi-	
cally	
from	
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
by	
ongoing	
co	
-	
contraction	
of	
agonist	
and	
antagonist	
muscles	
.	

Dystonia	DISEASE
can	
be	
focal	
,	
as	
in	
the	
case	
of	
muscles	
of	
the	
neck	
(	
torticollis	DISEASE
)	
or	
hand	
(

)	
,	
or	
generalized	
as	
in	
the	
case	
of	
torsion	DISEASE
dystonia	DISEASE
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
Sleep	
related	
leg	
cramps	DISEASE
are	
common	
and	
can	
affect	
sleep	
.	

Their	
association	
with	
other	
disorders	
and	
different	
medications	
hinder	
accurate	
epidemiological	
data	
and	
under-	
estimate	
their	
effect	
on	
sleep	
and	
on	
quality	
of	
life	
.	

Instruments	
to	
quantify	
the	
sever-	
ity	
of	
the	
disorder	
and	
its	
impact	
are	
needed	
to	
adequately	
address	
clinical	
relevance	
,	
treatment	
,	
and	
the	
potential	
occupational	
hazards	
.	

Effective	
treatments	
for	
sleep	
related	
leg	DISEASE
cramps	DISEASE
have	
yet	
to	
be	
developed	
.	

The	
prophylactic	
benefits	
of	
stretching	
exercises	
remain	
to	
be	
adequately	
validated

Notes

Although	
polysomnography	
is	
not	
required	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
,	
sleep	DISEASE
bruxism	DISEASE
,	
as	
described	
in	
the	
most	
recent	
version	
of	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep

to	
increase	
diagnostic	
reliability	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Bruxism	DISEASE
is	
defined	
as	
a	
repetitive	
jaw	
-	
muscle	
activity	
characterized	
by	
clenching	
or	
grinding	
of	
the	
teeth	
and/or	
by	
bracing	
or	
thrusting	
of	
the	
mandible	
.	

Bruxism	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
has	
been	
divided	
into	
its	
two	
distinct	
circadian	
manifestations	
:	
sleep	
bruxism	
and	
awake	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

In	
sleep	
,	
jaw	
muscle	DISEASE
contractions	DISEASE
are	
frequently	
repeated	
over	
time	
and	
are	
termed	
rhythmic	
masticatory	
muscle	
activity	
(	
RMMA	
)	
.	

These	
contractions	
can	
take	
two	
forms	
on	
electromyographic	
traces	
:	
a	
series	
of	
repetitive	
activity	
(	
phasic	
muscle	
contractions	
)	
or	
isolated	
sustained	
jaw	
clenching	
(	
tonic	
contractions	
)	
.	

These	
contractions	
during	
sleep	
produce	
tooth	
-	
grinding	
sounds	
and	
are	
referred	
to	
as	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
can	
lead	
to	
abnormal	
tooth	DISEASE
wear	DISEASE
,	
tooth	DISEASE
pain	DISEASE
,	
jaw	
muscle	DISEASE
pain	DISEASE
,	
and	
temporal	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
.	

Severe	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
may	
also	
result	
in	
sleep	
dis-	
ruption	
.	

This	
may	
involve	
not	
only	
the	
individual	
affected	
,	
but	
also	
the	
bed	
partner	
,	
because	
the	
sounds	
made	
by	
the	
friction	
of	
the	
teeth	
are	
usually	
perceived	
as	
being	
unpleasant	
and	
can	
be	
quite	
loud	
and	
disturbing	
to	
those	
nearby	
.	

The	
disorder	DISEASE
is	
typically	
brought	
to	
dental	
or	
medical	
attention	
because	
of	
the	
tooth	DISEASE
damage	DISEASE
,	
pain	DISEASE
,	
or	
disturbing	
sounds	
.	

Less	
commonly	
,	
it	
may	
present	
as	
a	
cause	
of	
dis-	
turbed	
sleep	
.	

Young	
and	
otherwise	
healthy	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
appear	
to	
have	
normal	
sleep	
structure	
and	
homeostasis	
.	

The	
majority	
of	
RMMA	
epi-	
sodes	
during	
sleep	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
sleep	
arousal	
.	

Jaw	
muscle	DISEASE
pain	DISEASE
,	
tenderness	DISEASE
in	
the	
masseter	
and	
temporalis	
muscle	
regions	
,	
morning	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
,	
or	
fatigue	DISEASE
can	
arise	
due	
to	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

Associated	
Features	
Additional	
symptoms	
include	
a	
variety	
of	
unpleasant	
muscle	
and	
tooth	DISEASE
sensations	DISEASE
,	
lim-	
itation	
of	
jaw	
movements	
,	
orofacial	DISEASE
pain	DISEASE
,	
and	
temporal	
/	
tension	
headaches	DISEASE
.	

Tooth	DISEASE
wear	DISEASE
,	
fractured	
teeth	
,	
and	
buccal	
lacerations	
also	
can	
occur	
.	

These	
symptoms	
may	
be	
induced	
by	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
,	
but	
the	
connection	
may	
not	
be	
apparent	
to	
the	
affected	
indi-	
vidual	
and	
diagnostic	
discrimination	
is	
weak	
.	

Headaches	DISEASE
are	
frequently	
reported	
by	
both	
adults	
and	
children	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

The	
headache	DISEASE
usually	
involves	
the	
temporal	
regions	
and	
it	
has	
the	
charac-	
teristics	
of	
a	
tension	
headache	DISEASE
.	

It	
is	
reported	
either	
in	
the	
morning	
(	
more	
frequently	
)	
or	
during	
the	
day	
(	
with	
wake	
bruxism	DISEASE
)	
.	

The	
estimated	
OR	
for	
headache	DISEASE
in	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
>	
4	
compared	
to	
controls	
.	

There	
is	
high	
individual	
variability	
in	
the	
intensity	
and	
duration	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
,	
but	
in	
the	
most	
severe	
cases	
,	
hundreds	
of	
events	
can	
occur	
during	
a	
night	
of	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
no	
direct	
relationship	
has	
been	
observed	
between	
the	
severity	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
and	
the	
appearance	
of	
clinical	
signs	
and	
symptoms	
.	

Indeed	
,	
indi-	
viduals	
with	
a	
mild	
to	
moderate	
index	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
bruxism	DISEASE
(	
2	
to	
4	
RMMA	
episodes	
/	
hour	
of	
sleep	
)	
have	
a	
higher	
risk	
of	
reporting	
painful	
jaw	
upon	
awakening	
(	
OR	
3.9	
)	
,	
and	
masticatory	DISEASE
muscle	DISEASE
fatigue	DISEASE
(	
OR	
5.1	
)	
compared	
to	
individuals	
with	
severe	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
(	
>	
4	
RMMA	
episodes	
/	
hour	
of	
sleep	
)	
.	

Psychosocial	
components	
may	
also	
be	
linked	
to	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

The	
psycholog-	
ical	
assessment	
of	
otherwise	
healthy	
adults	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
suggests	
a	
cor-	
relation	
(	
not	
yet	
proven	
as	
a	
causality	
)	
between	
bruxism	DISEASE
and	
stress	
/	
anxiety	DISEASE
.	

Moreover	
,	
both	
children	
and	
adults	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
seem	
to	
have	
higher	
scores	
in	
stress	
,	
anxiety	DISEASE
,	
and	
psychiatric	DISEASE
scales	
compared	
to	
control	
individuals	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
without	
clear	
cause	
is	
termed	
primary	
or	
idiopathic	DISEASE
.	

Forms	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
associated	
with	
the	
use	
of	
psychoactive	
medications	
,	
recreational	
drugs	
,	
or	
a	
variety	
of	
medical	
disorders	
(	
e.g.	
,	
Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
Down	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
)	
are	
defined	
as	
secondary	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

Treatment	
-	
induced	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
also	
termed	
iatrogenic	
.	

Although	
the	
primary	
form	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
most	
often	
reported	
in	
healthy	
children	
and	
adults	
,	
secondary	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
observed	
in	
children	
with	
cere-	
bral	
palsy	DISEASE
and	
mental	DISEASE
retardation	DISEASE
and	
in	
adult	
patients	
with	
abnormal	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
such	
as	
in	
oromandibular	DISEASE
myoclonus	DISEASE
/	
facio	
-	
mandibular	
myoclonus	DISEASE
or	
with	
sleep	
related	
breathing	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE
and	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
commonly	
co	
-	
occur	
.	

Tooth	DISEASE
grinding	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
clenching	DISEASE
also	
can	
occur	
during	
wakefulness	
,	
as	
an	
oral	
parafunc-	
tional	
activity	
known	
as	
awake	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

Awake	
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
considered	
a	
different	
dis-	
order	
,	
probably	
with	
different	
diagnostic	
criteria	
and	
pathophysiology	
;	
its	
association	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
still	
under	
debate	
.	

However	
,	
the	
two	
oral	
activities	
may	
coexist	
in	
the	
same	
individual	
.	

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
,	
based	
on	
reports	
from	
parents	
or	
sleep	
partner	
,	
is	
highest	
in	
childhood	
(	
approximately	
14	
%	
to	
17	
%	
)	
and	
then	
decreases	
over	
the	
life	
span	
.	

In	
teenagers	
to	
young	
adults	
,	
prevalence	
is	
in	
the	
12	
%	
range	
.

and	
changes

behaviors	DISEASE
(	
i.e.

)	
may	
influence	
reporting

There	
is	
no

for	
the

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Predisposing	
factors	
include	
personality	
types	
;	
for	
example	
,	
individuals	
who	
are	
highly	
motivated	
or	
characteristically	
maintain	
high	
vigilance	
may	
have	
an	
increased	
preva-	
lence	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

Genetic	
predisposition	
is	
plausible	
but	
still	
under	
investigation	
.	

As	
described	
below	
,	
there	
is	
some	
familial	DISEASE
predisposition	DISEASE
due	
to	
environmental	
or	
shared	
genetic	
factors	
.	

Recently	
,	
a	
serotonin	CHEMICAL
gene	
was	
described	
in	
bruxism	DISEASE
patients	
but	
the	
absence	
of	
distinction	
between	
the	
wake	
and	
sleep	
forms	
in	
this	
report	
preclude	
firm	
conclusions	
.	

Precipitating	
factors	
can	
include	
anxiety	DISEASE
related	
to	
current	
life	
events	
,	
tasks	
requir-	
ing	
high	
levels	
of	
performance	
,	
and	
repetitive	
tasks	
with	
short	
deadlines	
.	

The	
use	
of	
cigarettes	
or	
caffeine	CHEMICAL
in	
the	
hours	
before	
sleep	
also	
can	
contribute	
to	
the	
occur-	
rence	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
(	
probably	
due	
to	
the	
increased	
arousals	DISEASE
and	
sleep	DISEASE
instability	DISEASE
)	
.	

The	
role	
of	
dental	
morphologic	
“	
defects	
”	
(	
occlusal	
interferences	
)	
remains	
controver-	
sial	
in	
the	
etiology	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

Tooth	
contacts	
do	
not	
usually	
set	
in	
motion	
a	
bruxism	DISEASE
episode	
;	
they	
are	
usually	
late	
in	
the	
series	
of	
events	
occurring	
during	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
/	

tooth	
grinding	
.	

Hence	
,	
the	
causality	
link	
between	
tooth	DISEASE
contact	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
related	DISEASE
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
not	
supported	
by	
the	
temporal	
sequence	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	
Sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
tends	
to	
occur	
in	
families	
;	
approximately	
20	
%	
to	
50	
%	
of	
affected	
individuals	
have	
at	
least	
one	
direct	
family	
member	
with	
a	
history	
of	
tooth	DISEASE
grinding	
,	
and	
childhood	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
appears	
to	
persist	
into	
adulthood	
in	
two	
thirds	
of	
reported	
cases	
.	

However	
,	
no	
genetic	
variants	
or	
genetic	
inheritance	
patterns	
so	
far	
have	
been	
associated	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
onset	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
may	
occur	
during	
childhood	
,	
adolescence	
,	
or	
adulthood	
.	

It	
is	
difficult	
to	
establish	
the	
time	
of	
onset	
with	
precision	
because	
it	
is	
mainly	
based	
on	
the	
awareness	
of	
the	
individual	
or	

his	
/	
her	
family	
members	
who	
report	
the	
disorder	
.	

Sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
in	
childhood	
has	
been	
reported	
by	
parents	
to	
begin	
as	
soon	
as	
both	
upper	
and	
lower	
teeth	
have	
erupted	
.	

Secondary	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
may	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
,	
but	
is	
more	
common	
in	
younger	
and	
middle	
-	
aged	
adults	
.	

Even	
without	
a	
tooth	
grinding	
history	
or	
complaints	
,	
RMMA	
may	
be	
observed	
in	
most	
normal	
sleepers	
(	
on	
average	
,	
one	
episode	
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
)	
across	
the	
life	
span	
.	

However	
,	
in	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
,	
jaw	
-	
muscle	
contractions	
are	
more	
frequent	
and	
more	
intense	
.	

This	
may	
explain	
the	
secondary	
tooth	DISEASE
damage	DISEASE
and	
the	
occurrence	
of	
pain	DISEASE
and	
other	
symptoms	
.	

The	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
variability	
in	
episodes	
of	
audible	
tooth	
grinding	
sounds	
is	
large	
(	
greater	
than	
50	
%	
coefficient	
of	
variation	
)	
.	

In	
-	
laboratory	
polysomnographic	
record-	
ings	CHEMICAL
indicate	
that	
the	
corresponding	
variability	
in	
frequency	
of	
RMMA	
is	
smaller	
(	
approximately	
25	
%	
)	
,	
although	
ambulatory	
recording	
has	
suggested	
somewhat	
higher	
RMMA	
variability	
.	

First	
-	
night	
effect	
on	
RMMA	
index	
is	
minimal	
.	

Dental	
damage	
and	
abnormal	
tooth	DISEASE
wear	DISEASE
are	
the	
most	
frequent	
signs	
of	
the	
disorder	
.	

However	
,	
they	
are	
not	
a	
direct	
proof	
of	
current	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
and	
many	
contrib-	
uting	
factors	
have	
to	
be	
ruled	
out	
(	
e.g.	
,	
type	
of	
diet	
in	
the	
occurrence	
of	
abnormal	
tooth	DISEASE
wear	DISEASE
)	
.	

Diagnostic	
discriminative	
strength	
of	
these	
dental	
findings	
is	
weak	
;	
severity	
of	
wear	DISEASE
can	
not	
account	
for	
the	
index	
(	
i.e.	
,	
frequency	
of	
RMMA	
)	
.	

Sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
could	
lead	
to	
temporomandibular	DISEASE
joint	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
pain	DISEASE
,	
joint	
sound	
[	
click	
]	
,	
or	
jaw	
movement	
limitations	
)	
,	
although	
recent	
evidence	
does	
not	
support	
this	
association	
.	

Transient	
morning	
orofacial	DISEASE
pain	DISEASE
,	
including	
temporal	
headaches	DISEASE
,	
is	
not	
uncommon	
,	
as	
described	
above	
.	

Hypertrophy	
of	
the	
masseter	
and	
temporalis	
muscles	
can	
occur	
,	
but	
the	
diagnostic	
specificity	
of	
this	
finding	
for	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
also	
weak	
.	

The	
natural	
course	
of	
this	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
usually	
benign	
.	

Many	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
remain	
asymptomatic	
for	
most	
of	
their	
lives	
.	

Others	
can	
experi-	
ence	
associated	
symptoms	
(	
i.e.	
,	
pain	DISEASE
)	
that	
may	
interfere	
with	
their	
quality	
of	
life	
and/	
or	
sleep	
and	
may	
require	
treatments	
.	

Further	
diagnostic	
investigations	
and	
assessment	
are	
recommended	
if	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
associated	
with	
other	
more	
severe	
sleep	
or	
medical	
disorders	
(	
e.g.	
,	
SRBD	
,	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
epilepsy	DISEASE
)	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
Sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
frequently	
reported	
in	
childhood	
but	
decreases	
with	
age	
.	

However	
,	
some	
individuals	
may	
experience	
it	
every	
night	
for	
most	
of	
their	
lives

Conceptualizations	
of

,	
whereas	
others	
view

and

Sleep

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
majority	
of	
RMMA	
episodes	
during	
sleep	
(	
up	
to	
80	
%	
)	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
episodes	
typically	
follow	
a	
clear	
arousal	
sequence	
,	
starting	
with	
increased	
sympathetic	
-	
cardiac	
activity	
and	
fast	
electroenceph-	
alographic	
(	
EEG	
)	
waves	
in	
the	
minutes	
to	
seconds	
preceding	
the	
onset	
of	
an	
RMMA	
episode	
.	

The	
jaw	
muscle	
contractions	
are	
then	
followed	
by	
,	
or	
are	
concomitant	
with	
,	
an	
increase	
in	
blood	
pressure	
and	
ventilation	
.	

RMMA	DISEASE
episodes	
sometimes	
conclude	
with	
swallowing	
.	

Other	
causes	
of	
sleep	
bruxism	
onset	
are	
unknown	
,	
although	
potential	
candidates	
include	
airway	
resistance	
and	
oropharyngeal	
dryness	
.	

In	
the	
majority	
of	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
,	
the	
frequency	
of	
sleep	
arous-	
als	
is	
within	
the	
normal	
range	
.	

However	
,	
they	
may	
have	
an	
exaggerated	
responsiveness	
to	
ongoing	
sleep	DISEASE
arousals	DISEASE
or	
an	
increased	
magnitude	
of	
arousal	
.	

Individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
show	
more	
CAP	CHEMICAL
phase	
A3	
(	
as	
described	
by	
the	
scoring	
and	
analysis	
of	
cyclic	
alternating

(	
CAP	CHEMICAL
)	
during	
sleep	
)	
than	
controls	
,	
an	
expression	
of	
increased	
arousal	
pressure	
and	
increased	
sleep	DISEASE
instability	DISEASE
.	

This	
increased	
sleep	DISEASE
instability	DISEASE
seems	
to	
be	
the	
“	
permissive	
window	
”	
for	
occurrence	
of	
RMMA	
during	
sleep	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnographic	
(	
PSG	
)	
monitoring	
of	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
demonstrates	
increased	
masseter	
and	
temporalis	
muscle	
activity	
during	
sleep	
,	
along	
with	
grinding	
sounds	
.	

RMMA	DISEASE
episodes	
can	
occur	
during	
all	
sleep	
stages	
,	
but	
are	
most	
common	
in	
sleep	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
(	
more	
than	
80	
%	
of	
episodes	
)	
,	
whereas	
fewer	
than	
10	
%	
of	
RMMA	
episodes	
occur	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
in	
some	
individuals	
,	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
occurs	
predominantly	
in	
REM	
sleep	
.	

As	
described	
above	
,	
the	
majority	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
episodes	
are	
temporally	
associated	
with	
sleep	
arousal	
and	
are	
preceded	
by	
signs	
of	
autonomic	
/	
cardiac	
activa-	
tion	
(	
e.g.	
,	
increased	
heart	
rate	
and	
blood	
pressure	
)	
.	

Three	
subtypes	
of	
the	
EMG	
pattern	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
have	
been	
described	
:	
phasic	
activity	
at	
1	
Hz	
frequency	
with	
EMG	
bursts	
lasting	
0.25	
to	
2	
seconds	
;	
sustained	
tonic	
activity	
lasting	
longer	
than	
2	
seconds	
;	
or	
a	
mixed	
pattern	
.	

An	
episode	
begins	
after	
at	
least	
a	
three	
-	
second	
interval	
with	
no	
muscle	
activity	
.	

Polysomnography	
is	
not	
usually	
performed	
in	
otherwise	
healthy	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
in	
routine	
clinical	
settings	
.	

However	
,	
PSG	
may	
be	
indicated	
to

,	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
night

,	
or	
epilepsy	DISEASE
.	

The	
sensitivity	
of	
polysomnographic	
study	
in	
detecting	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
in	
severe	
cases	
is	
moderate	
to	
high	
;	
in	
milder	
cases	
,	
however	
,	
it	
may	
be	
low	
due	
to	
the	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
variability	
in	
RMMA	
and	
tooth	
grinding	
.	

Ambulatory	
home	
monitoring	
may	
be	
used	
for	
screening	
,	
diagnosis	
,	
and	
treatment	
outcome	
assessment	
by	
studying	
the	
individual	
in	
his	
/	
her	
usual	
environment	
,	
but	
it	
is	
characterized	
by	
lower	
diagnostic	
specificity	
due	
to	
the	
absence	
of	
audiovisual	
record-	
ings	CHEMICAL
(	
i.e.	
,	
20	
%	
overestimation	
in	
RMMA	
frequency	
is	
expected	
due	
to	
poor	
capacity	
to	
exclude	
concomitant	
nonspecific	
activities	
)	
.	

To	
record	
and	
score	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
activity	
(	
i.e.	
,	
RMMA	
)	

,	
there	
must	
be	
a	
minimum	
of	
one	
masseter	
muscle	
monitor	
,	
ideally	
with	
audiovisual	
recording	
,	
to	
associate	
muscular	
activity	
with	
grinding	
sound	
production	
.	

Video	
monitoring	
helps	
distinguish	
bruxism	DISEASE
from	
other	
orofacial	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
masticatory	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
that	
normally	
occur	
during	
sleep	
(	
e.g.

(	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
epilepsy	DISEASE
and	
tooth	DISEASE

oromandibular	DISEASE
myoclonus	DISEASE
)	
.	

For	
the	
best	
level	
of	
diagnostic	
specificity

,	
bilateral	
masseter

referenced	
to

Oromandibular	DISEASE

has	
been	
observed	
in	
approximately	
10	
%	
of	
individuals

it	
can	
also	
occur

As	
opposed	
to	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
,	
faciomandibular	
myoclonus	DISEASE
consists	
of	
EMG	
bursts	
of	
brief	
duration	
(	
less	
than	
250	
milliseconds

A

expert	
bruxism	DISEASE
international	
group	
has	
proposed	
a	
diagnostic	
grading	
system	
of	
“	
possible	
,	
”	
“	
probable	
,	
”	
and	
“	
definite	
”	
for	
both	
sleep	
and	
awake	
bruxism	DISEASE
.	

Such	
a	
clinical	
tool	
will	
help	
to	
discriminate	
sleep	
bruxism	
from	
awake	
bruxism	DISEASE
,	
although	
further	
validation	
is	
required	
for	
clinical	
and	
research	
purposes	
in	
all	
relevant	
dental	
and	
medical	
domains	
.	

In	
summary	
,	
this	
group	
suggests	
that	
a	
rating	
of	
:	
(	
1	
)	
“	
possible	
”	
is	
given	
if	
based	
on	
self	
-	
report	
,	
by	
means	
of	
questionnaires	
,	
and/or	
the	
anamnestic	
part	
of	
a	
clinical	
examination	
;	
(

)	
“	
probable	
”	
sleep	
or	
awake	
bruxism	DISEASE
is	
given	
if

The	
clinical	
relevance	
of	
sleep

in	
cases

such	
as

needs	
to	
be	
assessed	
in	
order	
to	
distinguish	
primary	
benign	
forms	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
from	
those	
that	
rep-	
resent	
an	
epiphenomenon	
of	
other	
more	
severe	
sleep	
and	
medical	
disorders	
.	

Sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
may	
be	
concomitant	
to	
breathing	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
including	
any	
level	
of	
severity	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
;	
further	
research	
is	
in	
progress	
to	
assess	
the	
specificity	
and	
validity	
of	
this	
association	
.	

There	
is	
currently	
no	
evidence	
supporting	
the	
possibility	
that	
patients	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
,	
in	
its	
primary	
form	
,	
are	
at	
increased	
risk	
of	
neurological	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
;	
such	
a	
risk	
factor	
assessment	
needs	
long-	
term	
study	
before	
any	
conclusion	
can	
be	
drawn	
.	

Investigation	
of	
genetic	
associations	
to	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	DISEASE
require	
large	
sample	
sizes	
,	
using	
valid	
tools	
to	
assess	
the	
specificity	
of	
RMMA	
versus	
other	
oromandibular	DISEASE
activities	
and	
to	
discriminate	
gene	
candidates	
specific	
for	
bruxism	DISEASE
from	
those	
related	
to	
its	
comorbidities	
such	
as	
stress	
or	
other	
related	
triggers	
of	
RMMA

A.	

The	
patient	
exhibits	
repetitive

and	
rhythmic	
motor	
behaviors	
involving	
large	
muscle	
groups	
.	

B.	
The	
movements	
are	
predominantly	
sleep

,	
occurring	
near	
nap	
or

,	
or	
when	
the	
individual	
appears	
drowsy	
or

result	
in	
a	
significant

as	
manifest	
by	
at	
least	
one	
of	
the	
following:1

When	
there	
are	
no	
clinical	
consequences	
of	
the	
rhythmic	
movements	
,	
the	
rhythmic	
movements	
are	
simply	
noted	
but	
the	
term	
rhythmic	
movement	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
is	
not	
employed	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movement	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
RMD	DISEASE
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
repetitive	
,	
ste-	
reotyped	
,	
and	
rhythmic	
motor	
behaviors	
(	
not	
tremors	DISEASE
)	
that	
occur	
predominantly	
during	
drowsiness	DISEASE
or	
sleep	
and	
involve	
large	
muscle	
groups	
.	

The	
occurrence	
of	
significant	
clinical	
consequences	
differentiates	
RMD	
from	
developmentally	
normal	
sleep	
related	
movements	
.	

Typically	
seen	
in	
infants	
and	
children	
,	
but	
also	
in	
adults	
,	
RMD	
comprises	
several	
sub-	
types	
.	

Body	
rocking	
may	
involve	
the	
entire	
body	
,	
with	
the	
individual	
on	
hands	
and	
knees	
,	
or	
it	
may	
be	
limited	
to	
the	
torso	
,	
with	
the	
individual	
sitting	
.	

Head	
banging	
often	
occurs	
with	
the	
person	
prone	
,	
repeatedly	
lifting	
the	
head	
or	
entire	
upper	
torso	
,	
and	
forc-	
ibly	
banging	
the	
head	
back	
down	
into	
the	
pillow	
or	
mattress	
.	

Alternately	
,	
the	
individual	
may	
sit	
with	
the	
back	
of	
the	
head	
against	
the	
headboard	
or	
wall	
,	
repeatedly	
banging	
the	
occiput	
.	

Combining	
head	
banging	
and	
body	
rocking	
,	
they	
may	
rock	
on	
hands	
and	
knees	
,	
banging	
the	
vertex	
or	
frontal	
region	
of	
the	
head	
into	
the	
headboard	
or	
wall	
.	

Head	
rolling	
consists	
of	
side	
-	
to	
-	
side	
head	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
,	
usually	
with	
the	
child	
(	
or	
adult	
)	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
.	

Less	
common	
rhythmic	
movement	
forms	
include	
body	
rolling	
,	
leg	
banging	
,	
or	
leg	
rolling	
.	

Rhythmic	
humming	
or	
inarticulate	
sounds	
often	
accompany	
the	
body	
,	
head	
,	
or	
limb	
movements	
and	
may	
be	
quite	
loud	
.	

Episodes	
often	
occur	
near	
sleep	
onset	
,	
although	
they	
also	
may	
occur	
at	
any	
time	
during	
the	
night	
and	
even	
during	
quiet	
wakeful	
activities	
,	
such	
as	
listening	
to	
music	
or	
trav-	
eling	
in	
vehicles	
.	

The	
movement	
frequency	
can	
vary	
,	
but	
the	
rate	
is	
usually	
between	
0.5	
per	
second	
and	
two	
per	
second	
.	

Duration	
of	
the	
individual	
movement	
clusters	
also	
varies	
but	
generally	
is	
less	
than	
15	
minutes	
.	

Cessation	
of	
movements	
may	
occur	
fol-	DISEASE
lowing	
environmental	
disturbance	
or	
being	
spoken	
to	
.	

Children	
who	
have	
sufficient	
language	
development	
to	
be	
asked	
about	
event	
recall	
in	
the	
morning	
are	
typically	
amnestic	DISEASE
for	
the	
episodes	
.	

Rarely	
,	
adults	
will	
report	
a	
volitional	
component	
.	

Sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
are	
common	
in	
normal	
infants	
and	
children	
.	

Without	
evidence	
for	
significant	
consequences	
,	
the	
movements	
alone	
should	
not	
be	
considered	
a	
disorder	
.	

Sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
should	
be	
considered	
a	
disorder	
only	
if	
the	
behaviors	
significantly	
interfere	
with	
normal	
sleep	
,	
cause	
significant	
impairment	
in	
daytime	
function	
,	
or	
result	
in	
self	
-	
inflicted	
bodily	
injury	
(	
or	
would	
result	
in	
injury	
if	
preventive	
measures	
are	
not	
used	
)	
.	

Associated	
Features	
The	
vast	
majority	
of	
infants	
and	
children	
with	
sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
are	
otherwise	
developmentally	
and	
intellectually	
normal	
,	
as	
are	
most	
adolescents	
and	
adults	
.

Demographics	

At	
nine	
months	
of	
age	
,	
59	
%	
of	
all	
infants	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
exhibit	
one	
or	
more	
of	
the	
following	
sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
:	
body	
rocking	
(	
43	
%	
)	
,	
head	
banging	
(	
22	
%	
)	
,	
or	
head	
rolling	
(	
24	
%	
)	
.	

At	
18	
months	
,	
the	
overall	
prevalence	
has	
been	
reported	
to	
decline	
to	
33	
%	
,	
and	
by	
five	
years	
,	
to	
only	
5	
%	
.	

Most	
pediatric	
studies	
have	
found	
no	
sex	
difference	
.	

Over	
50	
cases	
of	
RMD	DISEASE
have	
been	
reported	
in	
adolescents	
and	
adults	
,	
with	
a	
male	
pre-	
ponderance	
found	
in	
adults	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
soothing	
effect	
of	
vestibular	
stimulation	
has	
been	
proposed	
as	
the	
initiating	
factor	
in	
infants	
and	
toddlers	
.	

Environmental	
stress	
and	
lack	
of	
environmental	
stimulation	
have	
also	
been	
proposed	
as	
factors	
.	

One	
study	
found	
higher	
anxiety	DISEASE
scores	
in	
children	
with	
body	
rocking	
than	
in	
controls	
.	

Self	
-	
stimulation	
has	
been	
suggested	
as	
a	
factor	
,	
particularly	
in	
intellectually	
disabled	
,	
autistic	DISEASE
,	
and	
emotionally	
disturbed	
children	
.	

Rhythmic	
movements	DISEASE
have	
been	
postulated	
to	
be	
a	
calming	
technique	
employed	
by	
children	
to	
combat	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Rhythmic	
movements	DISEASE
have	
been	
reported	
in	
association	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
,	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
RBD	DISEASE
,	
and	
ADHD	DISEASE
.	

Rhythmic	
movements	
may	
be	
used	
as	
a	
conscious	
strategy	
to	
relieve	
the	
urge	
to	
move	
or	
the	
uncomfortable	
sensations	DISEASE
associated	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
.	
OSA-	

associated	
RMD	
often	
improves	
with	
positive	
airway	
pressure	
.	

Individuals	
with	
narco-	
lepsy	
may	
initiate	
rhythmic	
movements	
to	
terminate	
episodes	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
paralysis	DISEASE
.	

In	
older	
children	
or	
adults	
,	
stereotypic	
movements	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
intellectual	DISEASE
disability	DISEASE
or	
autism	DISEASE
spectrum	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
in	
most	
of	
these	
cases	
,	
the	
movements	
are	
not	
predominantly	
sleep	
related	
,	
and	
an	
additional	
diagnosis	
of	
RMD	DISEASE
is	
not	
indicated	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

A	
familial	
pattern	
has	
been	
reported	
rarely	
,	
as	
has	
occurrence	
in	
identical	
twins	
.	

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
onset	
of	
sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
is	
typically	
in	
early	
childhood	
.	

Body	
rocking	
has	
a	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
six	
months	
,	
head	
banging	
of	
nine	
months	
,	
and	
head	
rolling	
of	
ten	
months	
.	

The	
condition	
may	
rarely	
present	
at	
an	
older	
age	
following	
central	
nervous	
system	
trauma	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
commonly	
resolve	
in	
the	
second	
or	
third	
year	
of	
life	
.	

Persistence	
at	
five	
years	
of	
age	
occurs	
in	
about	
5	
%	
of	
children	
.	

Sleep	
related	
movements	
rarely	
continue	
into	
adolescence	
and	
adulthood	
.	

Worsening	
or	
spontaneous	
onset	
in	
adults	
is	
very	
rare	
.	

In	
some	
adult	
cases	
the	
chief	
concern	
is	
disturbance	
of	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
.	

Most	
adolescents	
and	
adults	
have	
one	
form	
of	
RMD	DISEASE
,	
although	
some	
have	
two	
or	
more	
.	

Head	
banging	
is	
the	
most	
disturbing	
form	
of	
the	
problem	
.	

Typical	
cases	
in	
infants	
and	
toddlers	
pose	
little	
risk	
of	
serious	
injury	
.	

Vigorous	
rhythmic	
movements	
can	
produce	
loud	
noises	
when	
the	
patient	
hits	
the	
bed	
frame	
or	
when	
the	
bed	
bangs	
against	
the	
wall	
or	
floor	
.	

The	
noises	
can	
be	
very	
disturbing	
to	
other	
family	
members	
.	

Parental	
concern	
is	
common	
,	
and	
psychosocial	
consequences	
in	
the	
older	
individual	
can	
be	
distressing	
.	

It	
is

Developmental	
Issues	
Because	
age

factors	
are	
a	
critical	
dimension	
for	
RMD

developmental	
issues	
are	
discussed

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
In	
infants	
and	
young	
children	
,	
rhythmic	
movements	DISEASE
have	
been	
hypothesized	
to	
promote	
motor	
development	
by	
stimulation	
of	
the	
vestibular	
system	
.	

More	
recently	
,	
the	
role	
of	
inhibitory	
control	
on	
the	
central	
motor	
pattern	
generator	
has	
been	
sug-	
gested	
as	
a	
physiologic	
mechanism	
to	
explain	
both	
pediatric	
and	
adult	
forms	
of	
sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
.

polysomnographic	
studies	
have	
shown	
rhythmic	
movements	
to	
occur	
most	
often	
in	
association	
with	
stages

and	
N2	
sleep	
;

during

NREM	
and	
REM	
sleep	
;	
and	
24	
%	
only	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
exclusively	
REM	
-	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
occur	
more	
frequently	
in	
adults	
.	

Although	
an	
epileptic	DISEASE
etiology	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
one	
individual	
,	
most	
EEG	
studies	
have	
shown	
normal	
activity	
between	
epi-	
sodes	
of	
rhythmic	
behavior	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
RMD	
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
repetitive	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
involving	
restricted	
small	
muscle	
groups	
,	
such	
as	
sleep

bruxism	DISEASE
,	
thumb	
sucking	
,	
and	
rhythmic	
sucking	
of	
a	
pacifier	
or	
the	
lips	
,	
as	
well	
as	
other	
specifically	
defined	
rhythmic	
movements	
of	
sleep	
,	
such	
as	
hypnagogic	
foot	
tremor	DISEASE

Rhythmic	
movements	
may	
occur	
as	
a	
conscious	
or	
unconscious	
strategy	
to	
relieve	
RLS	DISEASE
symptoms	
.	

If	
the	
rhythmic	
move-	
ments	
are	
clearly	
in	
response	
to	
RLS	DISEASE
sensations	DISEASE
,	
then	
a	
separate	
diagnosis	
of	
RMD	DISEASE
is	
not	
needed	
.	

However	
,	
RMD	
may	
be	
diagnosed	
if	
RMD	
criteria	
are	
met	
and	
RLS	DISEASE
does	
not	
adequately	
explain	
the	
presence	
or	
extent	
of	
rhythmic	
movements	
.	

Children	
with	
autism	DISEASE

often	
exhibit	
repetitive	DISEASE
behaviors	DISEASE
,	
but	
these	
movements	
typically	
occur	
during

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
is	
controversy	
about	
the	
classification	
of	
hypnagogic	
foot	
tremor	DISEASE
as	
a	
separate	
entity	
or	
as	
a	
subtype	
of	
sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
.	

Many	
aspects	
of	
sleep	
related	
rhythmic	
movements	
deserve	
further	
study	
,	
including	
the	
relationship	
of	
the	
typical	
form	
seen	
in	
otherwise	
normal	
infants	
and	
young	
children	
to	
the	
rhythmic	
movements	
seen	
in	
children	
with	
intellectual	DISEASE
disability	DISEASE
and	
autism	DISEASE
spectrum	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

The	
pathophysiology	
of	
persistent	
RMD	
is	
poorly	
understood	
,	
as	
is	
the	
association	
with	
other

Essential	
Features	
Benign	
sleep	
myoclonus	DISEASE
of	
infancy	
(	
BSMI	
)	
is	
characterized	
by	
repetitive	
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
in	
neonates	
and	
infants	
.	

Although	
BSMI	
is	
benign	
and	
relatively	
rare	
,	
it	
is	
included	
in	
the	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
section	
because	
it	
is	
commonly	
confused	
with	
epilepsy	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
unlike	
the	
jerks	DISEASE
of	
myoclonic	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
and	
myoclonic	DISEASE
encephalopathy	DISEASE
,	
the	
jerks	
of	
BSMI	
occur	
exclusively	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
jerks	DISEASE
are	
often	
bilateral	
and	
massive	
,	
typically	
involving	
large	
muscle	
groups	
.	

The	
movements	
can	
occur	
in	
the	
whole	
body	
or	
exclusively	
in	
the	
limbs	
,	
the	
trunk	
,	
or	
rarely	
,	
the	
face	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Not

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
Most	
infants	
with	
BSMI	
are	
neurologically	
normal	
,	
born	
to	
mothers	
with	
no	
history	
of	
illicit	
drug	
use	
.	

However	
,	
BSMI	
has	
been	
described	
in	
more	
than	
half	
of	
infants	
with	
neonatal	
opioid	
withdrawal	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
suggesting	
a	
subtype	
with	
this	
specific	
etiology	
.	

It	
must	
be	
stressed	
,	
however	
,	
that	
some	
cases	
of	
neonatal	
abstinence	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
do	
not	
follow	
a	
benign	
clinical	
course	
.	

Whether	
such	
cases	
should	
be	
included	
with	
those	
of	
BSMI	
is	
an	
unresolved	
matter	
.

Demographics	

The

unknown	
.	

The	
incidence	
has	
been	
estimated	
at	
3.7	
per	
10,000	
live	
births	
.	

More	
than	
200	
cases	
have	
been	
described	
in	
the	
literature	
.	

Males	
are	
affected	
more	
than	
females	
by	
a	
ratio	
of	
about	
2:1	
.	

The	
typical	
age	
range	
is

Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Onset	
is	
usually	
noted	
between	
birth	
and	
one	
month	
of	
age	
in	
a	
neurologically	
normal	
infant	
.	

The	
course	
is	
self	
-	
limited	
and	
benign	
.	

The	
disorder	
may	
be	
present	
for	
only	
a	
few	
days	
or	
may	
last	
for	
several	
months	
.	

Maximum	
expression	
is	
typically	
between	
15	
and	
35	
days	
of	
age	
.	

BSMI	
resolves	
by	
three	
months	
of	
age	
in	
64	
%	
of	
affected	
infants	
,	
by	
six	
months	
in	
95	
%	
,	
and	
by	
12	
months	
in	
97	
%	
with	
persistence	
rarely	
into	
the	
second	
year	
of	
life

There	
are	
no

at	
five

.	

There	
is	
no	
evidence	
for	
an	
increased	
risk

Developmental	
Issues	
Because	
age	
-	
related	
factors	
are	
a	
critical	
dimension	
for	
BSMI	
,	
developmental	
issues	
are	
discussed	
throughout	
this	
section	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
presence	
of	
a	
generator	
in	
the	
cervical	
spinal	
cord	
that	
is	
not	
adequately	
inhibited	
due	
to	
immature	
myelination	
of	
descending	
pathways	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Video	
-	
polysomnographic	
EEG	
and	
EMG	
monitoring	
has	
demonstrated	
paroxysmal	
muscle	
activity	
,	
without	
ictal	
or	
interictal	
EEG	
abnormalities	
.	

BSMI	
occurs	
predom-	
inantly	
during	
quiet	
sleep	
but	
also	
may	
be	
present	
during	
active	
sleep	
.	

The	
muscle	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
are	
usually	
seen	
in	
clusters	
of	
four	
or	
five	
jerks	
per	
second	
,	
each	
jerk	
lasting	
40	
to	
300	
milliseconds	
.	

BSMI	
clusters	
typically	
repeat	
in	
irregular	
series	
for	
one	
to	
15	
minutes	
,	
but	
,	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
the	
clusters	
may	
recur	
for	
up	
to	
60	
minutes	
or	
longer	
and	
be	
mistaken	
for	
status	DISEASE
epilepticus	DISEASE
.	

One	
study	
showed	
30	
%	
of	
the	
jerks	DISEASE
to	
involve	
the	
whole	
body	
,	
20	
%	
to	
involve	
the	
abdominal	
or	
proximal	
muscles	
,	
and	
50	
%	
to	
involve	
only	
the	
arms	
or	
the	
legs	
.	

The	
arms	
are	
usually	
more	
involved	
than	
the	
legs	
.	

Activity	
is	
symmetrical	
in	
over	
90	
%	
of	
cases	
but	
can	
be	
lateralized	
.	

The	
myoclonus	DISEASE
is	
not	
associ-	
ated	
with	
arousals	DISEASE
,	
awakenings	
,	
or	
sleep	
stage	
transitions	
.	

Spontaneous	
or	
provoked	
awakening	
of	
the	
infant	
leads	
to	
prompt	
,	
abrupt	
,	
and	
consis-	
tent	
cessation	
of	
the	
movements	
.	

Gentle	
rocking	
of	
the	
infant	
or	
the	
infant	
’s	
crib	
has	
been	
shown	
to	
provoke	
the	
myoclonus	DISEASE
.	

This	
may	
be	
a	
useful	
maneuver	
during	
EEG	
monitoring	
when	
differentiation	
from	
seizures	DISEASE
is	
of	
concern	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
jitteriness	DISEASE
and	
other	
nonepileptic	
etiologies	
,	
BSMI	
will	
often	
increase	
rather	
than	
be	
suppressed	
by	
gentle	
restraint	
.	

Neuroimaging	
studies	
are	
normal	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
BSMI	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
myoclonic	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
;	
misdiagnosis	
may	
lead	
to	
unnecessary	
diagnostic	
testing	
or	
medication	
use	
.	

The	
absence	
of	
episodes	
while	
awake	
in	
infants	
with	
BSMI	
is	
the	
single	
most	
helpful	
clinical	
feature	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
BSMI	
will	
stop	
abruptly	
and	
consistently	
when	
the	
infant	
is	
aroused	
.	

Neonatal	
sei-	
zures	
are	
often	
seen	
in	
the	
context	
of	
perinatal	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
such	
as	
hypoxic	
-	
ischemic	
encephalopathy	DISEASE
,	
infection	DISEASE
,	
or	
metabolic	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
,	
whereas	
BSMI	
is	
typically	
present	
in	
neurologically	
normal	
infants	
.	

Infantile	DISEASE
spasms	DISEASE
(	
West	
syndrome	
)	
are	
most	
often	
seen	
after	
the	
first	
month	
of	
life	
but	
sometimes	
occur	
earlier	
.	

Infantile	DISEASE
spasms	DISEASE
are	
usually	
manifest	
by	
sudden	
head	
flexion	
with	
arm	
extension	
and	
lower	
extremity	
flexion	
.	

They	
are	
usually	
associated	
with	
a	
hypsarrhythmic	DISEASE
EEG	
pattern	
.	

Pyridoxine-	
dependency	
seizures	DISEASE
are	
responsive	
to	
treatment	
with	
vitamin	CHEMICAL
B6	CHEMICAL
.	

In	
cases	
that	
are	
dif-	
ficult	
to	
differentiate	
,	
an	
EEG	
obtained	
during	
sleep	
will	
show	
normal	
patterns	
when	
BSMI	
is	
elicited	
by	
gentle	
rocking	
.	

Anticonvulsant	
medications	
are	
ineffective	
and	
unnecessary	
in	
BSMI	
.	

BSMI	
also	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
disorders	
that	
occur	
during	
wakeful-	
ness	
,	
including	
myoclonic	DISEASE
encephalopathies	DISEASE
,	
hyperekplexia	DISEASE
(	
startle	
disease	
)	
,	
drug	
withdrawal	
,	
and	
jitteriness	DISEASE
.	

Benign	
myoclonus	DISEASE
of	
early	
infancy	
usually	
occurs	
after	
the	
third	
month	
of	
life	
and	
only	
occurs	
during	
wakefulness	
.	

PLMD	DISEASE
can	
occur	
in	
infants	
but	
typically	
has	
a	
distinctly	
different	
duration	
and	
fre-	
quency	
.	

The	
muscle	
activity	
is	
of	
longer	
duration	
(	
0.5	
to	
10	
seconds	
)	
and	
recurs	
at	
a	
more	
regular	
and	
longer	
interval	
(	
typically	
20	
to	
40	
seconds	
)	
.	

PLMD	DISEASE
can	
be	
associated	
with	
EEG	
arousals	DISEASE
,	
whereas	
BSMI	
is	
not	
.

Notes

Although	
there	
is	
no	
current	
definitive	
evidence	
that	
propriospinal	
myoclonus	DISEASE
confined	
to	
sleep	
onset	
is	
associated	
with	
significant	
structural	
lesions	
of	
the	
spinal	
cord	
,	
propriospinal	
myoclonus	DISEASE
that	
is	
persistent	
during	
the	
day	
has	
been	
linked	
to	
structural	
spinal	
cord	
pathology	
in	
16	
%	
to	
20	
%	
of	
cases	
.	

Essential	
Features	
Propriospinal	
myoclonus	DISEASE
at	
sleep	
onset	
(	
PSM	
)	
consists	
of	
sudden	DISEASE
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
occurring	
in	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
and	
,	
rarely	
,	
during	
intrasleep	
wakefulness	
and	
upon	
awakening	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

The	
jerks	DISEASE
arise	
mainly	
in	
the	
axial	
muscles	
and	
spread	
rostrally	
and	
caudally	
according	
to	
propriospinal	
propagation	
.	

The	
jerks	DISEASE
may	
be	
of	
variable	
intensity	
;	
they	
are	
isolated	
,	
recurring	
in	
quasi	
-	
periodic	
fashion	
for	
variable	
durations	
,	
or	
may	
be	
repeated	
in	
brief	
clusters	
of	
a	
few	
movements	
,	
sepa-	
rated	
by	
longer	
intervals	
.	

Jerks	DISEASE
involve	
the	
abdominal	
and	
truncal	
muscles	
first	
and	
are	
then	
propagated	
to	
proximal	
muscles	
of	
the	
limbs	
and	
the	
neck	
.	

The	
pattern	
of	
move-	
ment	
is	
usually	
flexor	
but	
may	
be	
an	
extension	
of	
the	
trunk	
.	

Vocalization	
rarely	
occurs	
.	

The	
jerks	DISEASE
are	
most	
often	
spontaneous	
but	
,	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
can	
be	
evoked	
by	
external	
stimulations	
.	

The	
jerks	DISEASE
appear	
to	
be	
related	
to	
the	
recumbent	
position	
and	
a	
state	
of	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
,	
particularly	
when	
the	
patient	
tries	
to	
fall	
asleep	
.	

Any	
mental	
acti-	
vation	
makes	
the	
jerks	DISEASE
disappear	
.	

The	
jerks	DISEASE
eventually	
disappear	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
remain	
absent	
throughout	
all	
stages	
of	
sleep	
,	
even	
though	
they	
sometimes	
reappear	
during	
intrasleep	
wakefulness	
.	

Associated	
Features	
PSM	
often	
is	
associated	
with	
severe	
sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	DISEASE
due	
to	
the	
inability	
of	
the	
patient	
to	
fall	
asleep	
because	
of	
the	
recurrent	
disturbing	
muscular	
activity	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiological	
Subtypes	
PSM	
may	
be	
considered	
a	
variant	
of	
the	
more	
generally	
described	
propriospinal	
myoc-	
lonus	
seen	
during	
the	
daytime	
.	

In	
daytime	
PSM	
,	
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
involve	
the	
thoracoab-	
dominal	
/	
paraspinal	
or	
cervical	
muscles	
and	
spread	
caudally	
or	
rostrally	
to	
the	
other	
myotomes	
.	

The	
jerks	DISEASE
are	
provoked	
or	
worsened	
by	
the	
recumbent	
position	
and	
can	
not	
be	
voluntarily	
suppressed	
.	

They	
are	
often	
preceded	
by	
premonitory	
sensations	
,	
are	
stable	
over	
time	
,	
and	
respond	
unpredictably	
to	
drug	
treatment	
.	

The	
frequent	
presleep	
worsening	
of	
daytime	
PSM	
(	
around	
50	
%	
of	
the	
cases	
)	
suggests	
that	
patients	
with	
PSM	
may	
have	
a	
milder	
or	
variant	
form	
of	
a	
single	
clinical	
and	
neurophysiologic	
entity

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
of	
PSM	
is	
unknown	
.	

PSM	
is	
thought	
to	
originate	
from	
a	
focal	
spinal	
pattern	
generator	
,	
set	
into	
motion	
by	
supraspinal	
dysfacilitatory	
influences	
typical	
of	
the	
state	
of	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
and	
drowsiness	DISEASE
.	

PSM	
is	
presumed	
to	
propagate	
up	
and	
down	
the	
spinal	
cord	
via	
slowly	
conducting	
,	
long	
propriospinal	
(	
intersegmental	
)	
pathways	
.	

A	
focal	
spinal	
generator	
thus	
is	
able	
to	
recruit	
muscles	
from	
multiple	
segments	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnography	
demonstrates	
brief	
myoclonic	DISEASE
EMG	
bursts	
recurring	
nonperiodi-	
cally	
with	
alpha	
activity	
present	
on	
the	
EEG	
and	
,	
in	
particular	
,	
when	
alpha	
activity	
spreads	
from	
the	
posterior	
to	
the	
anterior	
brain	
regions	
.	

Epileptic	DISEASE
EEG	
discharges	
are	
not	
observed	
in	
PSM	
.	

Jerks	DISEASE
disappear	
either	
with	
EEG	
desynchronization	
,	
due	
to	
mental	
activation	
,	
or	
with	
appearance	
of	
sleep	
spindles	
and	
K	
-	
complexes	
.	

Jerks	DISEASE
remain	
absent	
throughout	
sleep	
but	
may	
occasionally	
reappear	
upon	
awakening	
and	
during	
intrasleep	
wakefulness	
.	

Polysomnography	
with	
extended	
EMG	
recording	
demonstrates	
that	
the	
jerks	DISEASE
arise	
first	
in	
spinal	
innervated	
muscles	
and	
then	
propagate	
to	
more	
caudal	
and	
rostral	
muscles	
according	
to	
a	
propriospinal	
pattern	
of	
propagation	
.	

Detailed	
analysis	
of	
the	
jerks	DISEASE
shows	
that	
the	
EMG	
activity	
originates	
in	
muscles	
innervated	
by	
thoracic	
or	
cervical	
spinal	
segments	
(	
sternocleidomastoid	
,	
paraspinalis	
,	
rectus	
abdominis	
)	
and	
then	
spreads	
to	
more	
rostrally	
and	
caudally	
innervated	
muscles	
at	
a	
slow	
velocity	
(	
2	
to	
16	
milliseconds	
;	
around	
5	
milliseconds	
on	
average	
)	
.	

Back	
-	
averaging	
of	
the	
EEG	
does	
not	
show	
any	
jerk	
-	
locked	
cortical	
activity	
.	

MRI	
of	
the	
brain	
is	
normal	
.	

In	
a	
recent	
review	
of	
PSM	
,	
only	
one	
patient	
with	
exacerbation	
at	
sleep	
onset	
had	
a	
hypersignal	
at	
T10	
-	
T11	
and	
a	
nonspecific	
medullary	
cone	
lesion	
.	

The	
remaining	
patients	
had	
no	
signs	
on	
spinal	
cord	
MRI	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

MRI	
of	
the	
spine	
is	
usually	
normal	
but	
demonstrates	
a	
focal	
lesion	
in	
around	
20	
%	
of	
the	
cases	
.	

The	
causal	
relationship	
of	
PSM	
with	
these	
spinal	
lesions	
is	
unclear	
,	
although	
magnetic	
resonance	
diffusion	
tensor	
imaging	
with	
fiber	
tracking	
may	
demonstrate	
spinal	
tract	
disorganization	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
PSM	
shows	
features	
similar	
to	
those	
of	
the	
syndrome	
of	
intensified	
sleep	
starts	
.	

However	
,	
sleep	
starts	
(	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
)	
usually	
appear	
during	
the	
transition	
between	
wakefulness	
and	
sleep	
and	
during	
light	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
whereas	
PSM	
may	
sometimes	
be	
present	
during	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
.	

Unlike	
PSM	
,	
sleep	
starts	
(	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
)	
some-	
times	
affect	
only	
one	
or	
a	
few	
body	
segments	
;	
propriospinal	
propagation	
is	
not	
present	
in	
neurophysiological	
studies	
of	
sleep	
starts	
.	

Phasic	
REM	
twitches	
,	
which	
are	
a	
normal	
phenomenon	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
involve	
the	
distal	
muscles	
of	
the	
hands	
and	
face	
,	
often	
without	
displacement	
of	
the	
body	
segment	
.	

Fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
resembles	
physiological	
hypnic	DISEASE
myoclonus	DISEASE
,	
but	
in	
an	
enhanced	
form	
,	
and	
persists	
throughout	
all	
stages	
of	
NREM	
and	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Both	
physiological	
hypnic	DISEASE
myoclonus	DISEASE
and	
frag-	
mentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
are	
EMG	
findings	
not	
associated	
with	
overt	
muscular	
activity	
and	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
do	
not	
involve	
muscles	
acting	
across	
large	
joints	
.	

Epileptic	DISEASE
myoclonus	DISEASE
is	
not	
confined	
to	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
and	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
epileptic	DISEASE
discharges	
on	
the	
EEG	
.	

PLMS	DISEASE
are	
longer	
in	
duration	
,	
involve	
mainly	
the	
lower	
limbs	
,	
and	
usually	
spare	
truncal	
and	
abdominal	
muscles	
.	

PLMs	
may	
begin	
during	
presleep	
wakefulness	
but	
generally	
occur	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

Some	
patients	
with	
RLS	DISEASE
may	
have	
prominent	
PLMs	
in	
wakefulness	
while	
sitting	
or	
lying	
down	
.	

However	
,	
prominent	
leg	
discomfort	
is	
usually	
present	
in	
these	
patients	
.	

Occasionally	
PSM	
may	
be	
present	
in	
RLS	DISEASE
/	DISEASE
PLMS	DISEASE
patients	
in	
wake	
before	
sleep	
,	
but	
the	
EMG	
morphology	
is	
different	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
when	
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
involving	
leg	
muscles	
appear	
,	
the	
PSM	
disappears	
.	

Psychogenic	
myoclonus	DISEASE
may	
simulate	
PSM	
but	
the	
muscle	
recruitment	
pattern	
,	
the	
spread	
velocity	
,	
and	
the	
record-	
ing	
of	
cortical	
premovement	
activity	
observed	
before	
voluntary	
movements	
may	
be	
useful	
to	
differentiate	
the	
two	
types	
of	
jerks	DISEASE
.	

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	
Future	
studies	
are	
needed	
to	
better	
define	
the	
distinctions	
between	
PSM	
and	
related	
conditions	
such	
as	
sleep	
starts	
(	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
)	
and	
,	
in	
particular	
,	
the	
syndrome	
of	
inten-	
sified	
sleep	
starts	
.	

Also	
,	
neuroimaging	
and	
possibly	
postmortem	
studies	
may	
detect	
the	
neural	
structures	
responsible	
for	
the	
initiation	
of	
the	
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE

Many

be	
associated	
with	
movement

are	
evident	
in	
wake	
and	
sleep

In	
some	
cases

the	
nocturnal	
manifestations

the	
movement	DISEASE

may	
be	
apparent	
before	
establishment	
of

,	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
“	
sleep

In

,	
“

unspecified	
”	
is	
a	
temporary	
diagnosis	
prior

Excessive	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
(	
EFM	
)	
is	
a	
largely	
incidental	
polysomnographic	
finding	
on	
EMG	
,	
characterized	
by	
small	
movements	
of	
the	
corners	
of	
the	
mouth	
,	
fingers	
,	
or	
toes	
,	
or	
by	
no	
visible	
movement	
at	
all	
.	

The	
finding	
is	
associated	
with	
no	
known	
clinical	
consequence	
.	

Large	
limb	
movements	
across	
large	
joint	
spaces	
are	
not	
characteristic	
of	
EFM	
and	
,	
if	
present	
,	
should	
exclude	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
EFM	
.	

Scoring	
of	
EFM	
is	
described	
in	
the	
most	
recent	
version	
of	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated	
Events	
.	

The	
condition	
is	
a	
NREM	
phenomenon	
and	
the	
move-	
ments	
resemble	
the	
phasic	
twitches	
seen	
in	
normal	
REM	
sleep	
except	
that	
they	
are	
more	
universally	
dispersed	
throughout	
a	
sleep	
epoch	
than	
phasic	
REM	
twitches	
,	
which	
are	
generally	
clustered	
within	
small	
groups	
in	
a	
sleep	
epoch	
.	

Its	
importance	
lies	
in	
that	
it	
is	
within	
the	
differential	
diagnosis	
of	
other	
sleep	
related	
movement	
disorders	
.	

Patients	
usually	
are	
not	
aware	
of	
the	
twitch	DISEASE
-	
like	
movements	
.	

Patients	
may	
have	
other	
coexistent	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
but	
EFM	
does	
not	
appear	
to	
contribute	
to	
the	
symptoms	
of	
these	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

EFM	
,	
a	
NREM	
phenomenon	
,	
is	
less	
common	
than	
phasic	
REM	
twitches	
,	
which	
occur	
in	
REM	
sleep	
in	
normal	
individuals	
without	
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
.	

Most	
cases	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
adults	
.	

EFM	
is	
predominantly	
found	
in	
males	
.	

A	
recent	
study	
found	
EFM	
in	
100	
%	
of	
62	
patients	
with	
a	
variety	
of	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
bringing	
into	
question	
the	
specificity	
of	
EFM	
.	

Numerous	
causes	
of	
chronic	
sleep	
fragmentation	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
EFM	
.	

The	
condition	
has	
been	
described	
with	
obstructive	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
and	
primary	
central	
sleep

,	
sleep

hypoxemic

syndromes	
,	
narcolepsy	DISEASE
,	
PLMD	DISEASE
,	
and	
various	
causes	
of	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

In	
apneic	DISEASE
patients	
,	
the	
twitching	
intensifies	
during	
periods	
of	
increased	
hypoxemia	DISEASE
.	

One	
report	
has	
found	
excessive

myoclonus	DISEASE
to	
be	
very	
common	
in	
children	
with	
Niemann	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
Pick	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
type	
C.	
No	
specific	
precipitating	
factors	
have	
been	
reported	
.	

The	
contribution	
of	
EFM	
to	
the	
symptomatology	
of	
any	
of	
these	
disorders	
is	
unknown	
.	

The	
course	
is	
not	
well	
studied	
but	
appears	
to	
be	
benign	
and	
non	
-	
progressive	
.	

The	
dis-	
order	
may	
be	
the	
sole	
abnormality	
in	
some	
cases	
of	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
but	
causality	
is	
questionable	
.	

No	
other	
serious	
consequences	
of	
the	
disorder	DISEASE
have	
been	
described	
when	
it	
occurs	
in	
isolation	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
EFM	
is	
present	
in	
normal	
individuals	
.	

Its	
relatively	
benign	
course	
sug-	
gests	
that	
it	
is	
not	
associated	
with	
a	
neurodegenerative	
process	
.	

In	
most	
reported	
cases	
,	
there	
have	
been	
associated	
sleep	DISEASE
abnormalities	DISEASE
and	
sleep	
disruption	
,	
suggesting	
that	
EFM	
may	
be	
due	
to	
disruptions	
of	
normal	
motor	
-	
control	
mechanisms	
during	
sleep	
.	

Whether	
there	
is	
a	
genetic	
or	
other	
basis	
predisposing	
individuals	
to	
develop	
the	
condi-	
tion	
is	
unknown	
.	

In	
any	
case	
,	
it	
would	
appear	
to	
result	
from	
intensification	
of	
an	
other-	
wise	
normal	
motor	
phenomenon	
.	

The	
predominant	
topographic	
distribution	
of	
EFM	
in	
distal	
and	
facial	
muscles	
suggests	
that	
cortical	
motor	
centers	
participate	
in	
its	
generation	
.	

EFM	
is	
detected	
as	
isolated	
,	
very	
brief	
(	
usually	
75	
to	
150	
milliseconds	
)	
,	
asymmetrical	
,	
asynchronous	
EMG	
potentials	
in	
various	
muscles	
of	
the	
face	
,	
trunk	
,	
arms	
,	
and	
legs	
.	

The	
amplitude	
varies	
from	
approximately	
50	
to	
several	
hundred	
microvolts	
;	
the	
taller	
amplitudes	
are	
often	
associated	
with	
visible	
movement	
of	
the	
fingers	
,	
toes	
,	
or	
corners	
of	
the	
mouth	
,	
whereas	
the	
smaller	
ones	
may	
resemble	
fasciculation	DISEASE
potentials	
and	
be	
without	
overt	
movement	
.	

Large	
movements	
across	
large	
joint	
spaces	
preclude	
a	
diag-	
nosis	
of	
EFM	
.	

Small	
twitch	
-	
like	
movements	
may	
be	
observed	
on	
video	
recording	
.	

Episodes	
of	
these	
myoclonic	DISEASE
potentials	
typically	
last	
from	
10	
minutes	
to	
several	
hours	
.	

They	
often	
appear	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
continue	
through	
the	
NREM	
sleep	
stages	
,	
includ-	
ing	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
EFM	
in	
REM	
is	
difficult	
to	
determine	
because	
it	
is	
superimposed	
on	
the	
normal	
phasic	
clusters	
of	
physiological	
phasic	
REM	
twitches	
.	

EFM	
is	
electromyographically	
similar	
to	
the	
latter	
.	

Occasionally	
,	
the	
EMG	
activity	
also	
persists	
during	
EEG	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
within	
the	
sleep	
period	
or	
is	
present	
in	
drowsiness	DISEASE
prior	
to	
sleep	
onset	
.	

The	
EEG	
usually	
shows	
no	
changes	
at	
the	
time	
of	
the	
movements	
,	
although	
high	
-	
amplitude	
EMG	
potentials	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
a	
K	CHEMICAL
complex	
or	
even	
with	
transient	
EEG	
arousal	
.	

There	
are	
no	
ocular	
or	
autonomic	
accom-	
paniments	
.	

It	
seems	
possible	
that	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
digitalization	
rates	
,	
digital	
systems	
may	
record	
less	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
than	
earlier	
paper	
records	
.	

No	
laboratory	
tests	
other	
than	
polysomnography	
(	
optimally	
with	
multiple	
EMG	
leads	
)	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
helpful	
in	
assessing	
EFM	
.	

EFM	
generally	
has	
a	
maximum	
burst	
duration	
of	
only	
150	
milliseconds	
and	
does	
not	
recur	
periodically	
.	

It	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
PLMS	DISEASE
because	
PLMS	DISEASE
are	
character-	
ized	
by	
a	
longer	
burst	
duration	
(	
typically	
0.5	
to	
10	
seconds	
)	
and	
a	
long	
period	
between	
bursts	
(	
5	
-	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

EFM	
,	
which	
occurs	
in	
NREM	
,	
must	
also	
be	
differentiated	
from	
normal	
physiological	
phasic	
REM	
twitches	
,	
which	
have	
a	
similar	
burst	
duration	
but	
are	
limited	
to	
the	
REM	
state	
and	
tend	
to	
occur	
in	
clusters	
within	
an	
epoch	
,	
as	
opposed	
to	
EFM	
in	
which	
bursts	
tend	
not	
to	
cluster	
within	
a	
particular	
epoch	
.	

Larger	
body	
move-	

ments	
across	
the	
large	
joints	
are	
not	
a	
feature	
of	
excessive	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
.	

The	
presence	
of	
such	
movements	
suggests	
other	
disorders	
.

Further	
investigation	
is	
necessary	
to	
determine	
whether	
EFM	
occurs	
as	
a	
consequence	
of	
sleep	
disruption	
or	
whether	
it	
is	
an	
independent	
cause	
of	
sleep	
disruption	
and	
daytime	
symptoms	
in	
its	
own	
right	
.	

It	
must	
also	
be	
determined	
whether	
there	
are	
any	
physiolog-	
ical	
differences	
that	
distinguish	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
seen	
in	
many	
normal	
individu-	
als	
from	
EFM	
.	

It	
is	
not	
known	
whether	
some	
additional	
pathophysiological	
element	
is	
required	
to	
increase	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
into	
an	
abnormal	
range	
.	

The	
current	
thresh-	
old	
for	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
EFM	
should	
be	
further	
investigated	
because	
the	
scoring	
criteria	
lack	
specificity	
.	

The	
apparent	
strong	
predominance	
in	
males	
also	
remains	
unexplained	
.

Hypnagogic	
Foot	
Tremor	DISEASE
and	
Alternating	
Leg	
Muscle	
Activation	
Hypnagogic	
foot	
tremor	DISEASE
(	
HFT	
)	
is	
rhythmic	
movement	
of	
the	
feet	
or	
toes	
that	
occurs	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
wake	
and	
sleep	
or	
during	
light	
NREM	
sleep	
(	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
)	
.	

Alternating	
leg	
muscle	
activation	
(	
ALMA	
)	
consists	
of	
brief	
activation	
of	
the	
ante-	
rior	
tibialis	
in	
one	
leg	
in	
alternation	
with	
similar	
activation	
in	
the	
other	
leg	
during	
sleep	
or	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
sleep	
.	

HFT	
may	
be	
a	
relatively	
common	
and	
normal	
finding	
.	

Affected	
individuals	
move	
the	
feet	
or	
the	
toes	
rhythmically	
for	
seconds	
to	
minutes	
during	
drowsy	
wakefulness	
or	
lighter	
stages	
of	
sleep	
.	

It	
can	
be	
pathologically	
exagger-	
ated	CHEMICAL
in	
some	
patients	
.	

ALMA	
is	
defined	
by	
a	
polysomnographic	
pattern	
with	
unknown	
clinical	
manifestations	
,	
but	
frequency	
of	
muscle	
activations	
,	
length	
of	
activations	
,	
and	
occurrence	
primarily	
with	
arousals	DISEASE
suggest	
that	
ALMA	
may	
be	
similar	
to	
HFT	
or	
rep-	
resent	
an	
EMG	
manifestation	
of	
some	
episodes	
of	
HFT	
.	

The	
original	
case	
series	
that	
described	
ALMA	
did	
not	
link	
it	
with	
movement	
of	
the	
lower	
extremity	
,	
but	
a	
subse-	
quent	
report	
did	
.	

HFT	
and	
ALMA	
are	
considered	
together	
because	
the	
relationship	
between	
them	
remains	
to	
be	
clarified	
,	
and	
the	
similarity	
in	
a	
number	
of	
their	
features	
suggests	
they	
may	
not	
be	
fully	
independent	
entities	
.	

Associated	
features	
of	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
are	
similar	
.	

Most	
cases	
of	
HFT	
have	
been	
reported	
in	
persons	
with	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
such	
as	
RLS	DISEASE
or	
SRBDs	DISEASE
.	

ALMA	
has	
been	
identified	
mainly	
in	
patients	
with	
SRBD	
or	
PLMs	
.	

Seventy	
-	
five	
percent	
of	
patients	
with	
ALMA	
in	
the	
original	
series	
used	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
medication	
.	

In	
that	
study	
,	
patients	
with	
ALMA	
complained	
of	
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
or	
restless	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
the	DISEASE
legs	DISEASE
,	
but	
only	
one	
reported	
patient	
had	
more	
specific	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
sudden	DISEASE
nocturnal	DISEASE
muscle	DISEASE
contractions	DISEASE
in	
his	
legs	
and	
a	
sensation	
that	
his	
legs	
were	
vibrating	
.	

A	
separately	
reported	
case	
of	
a	
patient	
with	
ALMA	
documented	
absence	
of	
any	
SRBD	
,	
PLMs	
,	
or	
use	
of	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
medication	
.	

This	
patient	
complained	
of	
frequent	
and	
easily	
provoked	
awakenings	
,	
as	
well	
as	
excessive	
daytime	DISEASE
sleepiness	DISEASE
.	

The	
ALMA	
and	
symptoms	
responded	
to	
treat-	
ment	
with	
pramipexole	CHEMICAL
.	

The	
single	
series	
in	
which	
HFT	
was	
studied	
found	
that	
it	
occurs	
in	
7.5	
%	
of	
patients	
in	
whom	
a	
polysomnogram	
was	
performed	
for	
other	
reasons	
.	

Affected	
individuals	
range	
in	
age	
from	
14	
to	
72	
years	
,	
with	
a	
majority	
in	
the	
middle	
-	
age	
range	
(	
40	
to	
65	
years	
)	
.	

Men	
and	
women	
are	
equally	
affected	
.	

It	
is	
possible	
that	
the	
frequency	
of	
these	
move-	
ments	
may	
be	
increased	
in	
individuals	
with	
disorders	
such	
as	
RLS	DISEASE
or	
SRBD	
,	
but	
it	
can	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
otherwise	
normal	
sleep	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
the	
condition	
in	
the	
general	
population	
and	
its	
frequency	
in	
affected	
individuals	
remains	
uncertain	
.	

The	
initial	
series	
reporting	
ALMA	
found	
that	
it	
occurs	
in	
1.1	
%	
of	
unselected	
studies	
from	
a	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
center	
.	

Patients	
with	
ALMA	
were	
mostly	
male	
(	
11:5	
)	
and	
ranged	
in	
age	
from	
12	
to	
70	
years	
,	
with	
most	
aged	
35	
to	
55	
years	
(	
mean	
age	
41	
years	
)	
.	

Therefore	
,	
the	
age	
ranges	
of	
both	
conditions	
are	
similar	
,	
with	
both	
males	
and	
females	
affected	
.	

These	
distributions	
may	
be	
due	
to	
the	
incidental	
discovery	
of	
both	
entities	
during	
routine	
sleep	
studies	
for	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
complaints	DISEASE
.	

No	
predisposing	
factors	
are	
known	
for	
HFT	
.	

The	
use	
of	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
medication	
may	
increase	
risk	
for	
ALMA	
.	

No	
longitudinal	
studies	
have	
been	
performed	
for	
either	
entity	
.	

In	
some	
individuals	
,	
HFT	
is	
an	
occasional	
finding	
,	
but	
others	
appear	
to	
manifest	
the	
rhythmic	
movements	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
Sleep	
Related	
Movement	
Disorders	
on	
many	
nights	
and	
over	
a	
span	
of	
at	
least	
months	
.	

ALMA	
showed	
some	
tendency	
to	
persist	
between	
two	
different	
recordings	
in	
the	
originally	
reported	
series	
.	

Because	
most	
individuals	
are	
unaware	
of	
the	
presence	
of	
the	
HFT	
movements	
,	
and	
patients	
with	
ALMA	
may	
have	
no	
associated	
complaint	
or	
awareness	
of	
the	
phenomenon	
,	
the	
evo-	
lution	
of	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
may	
be	
difficult	
to	
follow	
except	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
or	
with	
home	
monitoring	
.	

Although	
usually	
an	
incidental	
and	
benign	
finding	
,	
HFT	
may	
cause	
sleep	
disruption	
and	
sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	DISEASE
if	
sufficiently	
prolonged	
or	
severe	
.	

In	
HFT	
,	
the	
patient	
typically	
reports	
foot	
movements	
(	
directly	
experienced	
or	
observed	
by	
others	
)	
that	
occur	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
wake	
and	
sleep	
or	
during	
light	
sleep	
.	

On	
occasion	
,	
movement	
has	
not	
been	
observed	
but	
HFT	
is	
seen	
as	
an	
incidental	
finding	
on	
sleep	
study	
conducted	
for	
other	
indications	
.	

Polysomnography	
demonstrates	
a	
pattern	
of	
brief	
,	
repeated	
activation	
of	
the	
anterior	
tibialis	
in	
one	
leg	
.	

The	
minimum	
frequency	
is	
0.3	
Hz	
;	
the	
maximum	
4.0	
Hz	
.	

Multiple	
leg	
activations	
in	
a	
single	
leg	
occur	
in	
a	
train	
of	
at	
least	
four	
movements	
.	

EMG	
recordings	
of	
the	
foot	
or	
leg	
muscles	
or	
video	
record-	
ings	CHEMICAL
of	
movement	
may	
show	
trains	
of	
recurrent	
1	
-	
Hz	
to	
2	
-	
Hz	
EMG	
potentials	
or	
move-	
ments	
.	

Typical	
associated	
EMG	
bursts	
are	
300	
to	
700	
milliseconds	
in	
duration	
,	
and	
the	
typical	
duration	
of	
trains	
is	
10	
to	
15	
seconds	
,	
although	
longer	
bursts	
and	
trains	
have	
been	
reported	
.	

In	
morbid	
conditions	
,	
trains	
may	
persist	
much	
longer	
.	

Events	
are	
recorded	
at	
the	
transition	
into	
sleep	
and	
during	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
.	

Distribution	
over	
the	
night	
has	
not	
been	
fully	
investigated	
.	

Persistent	
HFT	
has	
been	
found	
in	
about	
half	
of	
the	
indi-	
viduals	
who	
have	
had	
multiple	
studies	
.	

Alternation	
between	
legs	
has	
not	
been	
described	
,	
but	
its	
potential	
occurrence	
is	
suggested	
in	
two	
published	
studies	
of	
HFT	
.	

In	
ALMA	
,	
polysomnography	
demonstrates	
a	
pattern	
of	
brief	
,	
repeated	
activation	
of	
the	
anterior	
tibialis	
in	
one	
leg	
alternating	
with	
similar	
activation	
in	
the	
other	
leg	
.	

At	
a	
minimum	
,	
a	
single	
leg	
muscle	
activation	
in	
one	
leg	
is	
followed	
sequentially	
by	
a	
similar	
single	
activation	
in	
the	
other	
leg	
,	
reactivation	
in	
the	
original	
leg	
,	
and	
then	
reactivation	
in	
the	
alternate	
leg	
,	
with	
some	
continued	
alternation	
beyond	
this	
minimal	
sequence	
in	
most	
instances	
.	

The	
minimum	
frequency	
of	
alternating	
EMG	
bursts	
is	
0.5	
Hz	
,	
and	
the	
maximum	
frequency	
is	
3.0	
Hz	
.	

The	
patient	
may	
report	
foot	
movements	
(	
directly	
experi-	
enced	
or	
observed	
by	
others	
)	
that	
occur	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
wake	
and	
sleep	
or	
during	
light	
sleep	
.	

As	
noted	
above	
,	
there	
is	
frequently	
no	
observation	
of	
movement	
reported	
but	
alternating	
leg	
muscle	
activation	
is	
recorded	
as	
an	
incidental	
finding	
on	
polysomnography	
.	

ALMA	
can	
be	
demonstrated	
by	
polysomnography	
if	
the	
surface	
EMG	
is	
recorded	
inde-	
pendently	
from	
both	
right	
and	
left	
anterior	
tibialis	
muscles	
.	

A	
sequence	
of	
ALMA	
may	
begin	
with	
one	
to	
several	
lengthy	
activations	
(	
one	
to	
two	
seconds	
)	
in	
one	
or	
both	
legs	
.	

Some	
patients	
show	
unilateral	
activity	
at	
times	
.	

ALMA	
usually	
closely	
precedes	
or	
follows	
an	
arousal	
or	
awakening	
and	
gradually	
diminishes	
as	
sleep	
returns	
.	

However	
,	
ALMA	
can	
also	
emerge	
without	
arousals	DISEASE
from	
any	
sleep	
stage	
.	

Proclivity	DISEASE
for	
any	
spe-	
cific	
portion	
of	
the	
nocturnal	
sleep	
cycle	
has	
not	
been	
identified	
.	

Leg	
muscle	
activa-	
tions	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
in	
comparison	
to	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
are	
often	
briefer	
and	
some-	

what	
less	
regular	
.	

Sequences	
of	
ALMA	
sometimes	
recur	
at	
intervals	
similar	
to	
those	
of	
PLMs	
.	

Extensor	
forearm	
EMG	
study	
may	
suggest	
alternating	
muscle	
activity	
in	
the	
upper	
extremities	
,	
though	
it	
is	
less	
prominent	
than	
activation	
in	
the	
legs	
.	

ALMA	
shows	
some	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
consistency	
.	

Repeat	
studies	
are	
likely	
to	
show	
persistent	
ALMA	
.	

The	
number	
of	
sequences	
recorded	
,	
on	
average	
,	
and	
the	
timing	
of	
ALMA	
with	
respect	
to	
arousals	DISEASE
tends	
to	
remain	
constant	
.	

The	
specific	
polysomnographic	
criteria	
for	
HFT	
during	
sleep	
and	
ALMA	
are	
defined	
in	
the	
most	
recent	
version	
of	
the	
AASM	
Manual	
for	
the	
Scoring	
of	
Sleep	
and	
Associated	
Events	
.	

Presentation	
of	
HFT	
or	
ALMA	
with	
other	
concurrent	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
is	
common	
.	

Because	
of	
the	
similar	
frequency	
,	
duration	
,	
and	
body	
part	
involvement	
of	
the	
move-	
ments	
,	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
may	
represent	
variants	
of	
the	
same	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

Insufficient	
sci-	

entific	
evidence	
has	
accumulated	
to	
make	
this	
a	
certainty	
.	

Thus	
,	
these	
entities	
are	
listed	
sequentially	
but	
separately	
.	

Of	
note	
,	
some	
have	
questioned	
whether	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
might	
represent	
a	
variant	
of	
rhythmic	
movement	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
in	
which	
movements	
are	
confined	
to	
the	
legs	
and	
an	
older	
population	
is	
affected	
.	

HFT	
and	
ALMA	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
sleep	
-	
onset	
movements	
:	
PLMD	DISEASE
(	
especially	
the	
polyclonic	
form	
)	
,	
PSM	
,	
and	
sleep	
related	
RMD	
.	

Movement	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
that	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
include	
dyskinetic	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
of	
the	
foot	
,	
such	
as	
painful	DISEASE
legs	DISEASE
and	
moving	
toes	
;	
tremors	DISEASE
or	
rhythmic	
movements	
of	
other	
cause	
(	
Parkinson	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
,	
clonus	
)	
;	
and	
neuroleptic	
-	
induced	
akathisia	DISEASE
.	

None	
of	
these	
conditions	
involves	
regular	
alternation	
between	
sides	
,	
as	
seen	
in	
ALMA	
,	
or	
an	
associ-	
ation	
with	
the	
use	
of	
antidepressant	CHEMICAL
medication	
.	

Whether	
HFT	
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
ALMA	
is	
not	
known	
.	

Potential	
differences	
based	
on	
existing	
reports	
include	
the	
presence	
of	
clear	
movement	
in	
HFT	
as	
opposed	
to	
some	
uncertainty	
whether	
ALMA	
must	
involve	
movement	
.	

ALMA	
,	
in	
contrast	
to	
HFT	
,	
alternates	
between	
sides	
,	
occurs	
in	
any	
sleep	
stage	
,	
can	
occur	
without	
arousal	
,	
and	
is	
associated	
with	
the	
use	
of	
antidepressants	CHEMICAL

.	

The	
degree	
to	
which	
these	
movements	
are	
quasi	
-	
voluntary	
remains	
to	
be	
determined	
because	
some	
are	
suppressible	
.	

Whether	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
are	
merely	
alternate	
forms	
of	
the	
same	
underlying	
motor	
mechanism	
is	
also	
unclear	
.	

As	
reports	
of	
these	
move-	
ments	
have	
arisen	
from	
reviews	
of	
sleep	
center	
records	
,	
nothing	
is	
known	
about	
their	
manifestation	
in	
the	
general	
population	
.	

The	
associations	
noted	
may	
be	
due	
to	
biased	
sampling	
caused	
by	
a	
skewing	
of	
the	
population	
toward	
those	
with	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
,	
especially	
respiratory	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

The	
degree	
to	
which	
HFT	
and	
ALMA	
have	
clinical	
significance	
remains	
uncertain

Sleep	
Starts	
(	
Hypnic	DISEASE
Jerks	DISEASE
)	

Sleep	
starts	
,	
also	
known	
as	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
,	
are	
sudden	
,	
brief	
,	
simultaneous	
contractions	
of	
the	
body	
or	
one	
or	
more	
body	
segments	
occurring	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
(	
or	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
)	
usually	
consist	
of	
a	
single	
contraction	
that	
often	
affects	
the	
body	
asymmetrically	
.	

The	
jerks	DISEASE
may	
be	
either	
spontaneous	
or	
induced	
by	
stimuli	
.	

The	
motor	
activity	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
a	
sensory	
component	
,	
which	
may	
be	
somesthetic	
,	
often	
an	
impression	
of	
falling	
or	
less	
commonly	
pain	DISEASE
or	
tingling	
;	
auditory	
,	
such	
as	
banging	
,	
snapping	DISEASE
or	
crackling	
noises	
;	
or	
visual	
,	
including	
flashing	
lights	
,	
hypnagogic	
dreams	
,	
or	
hallucina-	
tions	
.	

A	
sharp	
cry	
may	
occur	
.	

The	
patient	
may	
not	
recall	
a	
jerk	
that	
was	
noted	
by	
a	
bed	
partner	
if	
the	
sleep	
start	
does	
not	
cause	
awakening	
.	

Multiple	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
occasionally	
occur	
in	
succession	
,	
usually	
early	
in	
the	
sleep	
period	
.	

When	
sleep	
starts	
or	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
are	
frequent	
,	
intense	
,	
or	
repetitive	
,	
they	
may	
lead	
to	
sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Purely	
sensory	
sleep	
starts	
are	
subjective	
,	
localized	
,	
sensory	
impressions	
that	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
are	
not	
associated	
with	
motor	
activity	
.	

The	
term	
“	
Intensified	
sleep	
starts	
”	
has	
been	
applied	
to	
both	
the	
motor	
and	
purely	
sensory	
forms	
when	
a	
complaint	
of	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
as	
a	
result	
of	
the	
starts	
is	
present	
.	

A	
prevalence	
of	
60	
%	
to	
70	
%	
has	
been	
reported	
,	
but	
with	
a	
highly	
sporadic	
occurrence	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
affect	
all	
ages	
and	
both	
sexes	
.	

Excessive	
caffeine	CHEMICAL
or	
other	
stimulant	
intake	
,	
prior	
intense	
physical	
work	
or	
exercise	
,	
sleep	
deprivation	
,	
and	
emotional	
stress	
can	
increase	
the	
frequency	
and	
severity	
of	
sleep	
starts	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
are	
an	
essentially	
universal	
component	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
onset	
process	
,	
although	
they	
are	
often	
not	
recalled	
.	

Hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
may	
occur	
at	
any	
age	
,	
as	
a	
subjective	
com-	
plaint	
;	
however	
,	
they	
are	
usually	
encountered	
in	
adulthood	
.	

The	
course	
is	
usually	
benign	
.	

Intensified	
sleep	
starts	
may	
lead	
to	
avoidance	
/	
delay	
of	
sleep	
,	
a	
fear	
of	
falling	
asleep	
and	
chronic	
anxiety	DISEASE
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
acute	
and	
chronic	
sleep	
deprivation	
may	
occur	
.	

Sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	DISEASE
may	
result	
either	
from	
repeated	
awakenings	DISEASE
induced	
by	
the	
starts	
or	
from	
anxiety	DISEASE
about	
falling	
asleep	
.	

Injury	
,	
such	
as	
bruising	DISEASE
a	
foot	
against	
a	
bedstead	
or	
kicking	
a	
sleeping	
companion	
,	
may	
occasionally	
occur	
.	

The	
physiological	
mechanisms	
underlying	
sleep	
starts	
are	
uncertain	
.	

No	
pathologic	
finding	
has	
been	
described	
except	
for	
a	
single	
case	
of	
auditory	
sleep	
starts	
associated	
with	
a	
brainstem	
lesion	
.	

Hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
are	
hypothetically	
caused	
by	
sudden	
descending	
volleys	
originating	
in	
the	
brainstem	
reticular	
formation	
activated	
by	
the	
system	
insta-	
bility	DISEASE
at	
the	
transition	
between	
wake	
and	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
the	
similarity	
between	
sleep	
starts	
and	
the	
startle	
response	
has	
led	
some	
to	
postulate	
that	
abnormalities	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
sensory	DISEASE
Sleep	DISEASE
Related	DISEASE
Movement	DISEASE
Disorders	DISEASE
Sleep	DISEASE
Related	DISEASE
Movement	DISEASE
Disorders	DISEASE
processing	DISEASE
are	DISEASE
primary	DISEASE
,	
with	
secondary	
motor	
manifestations	
involving	
the	
reticulo-	
spinal	
tract	
.	

Sleep	
starts	
are	
a	
prominent	
symptom	
in	
hereditary	DISEASE
hyperekplexia	DISEASE
,	
some	
cases	
of	
which	
are	
caused	
by	
mutations	
in	
the	
glycine	CHEMICAL
receptor	
.	

It	
has	
also	
been	
postu-	
lated	
that	
sleep	
starts	
are	
a	
response	
to	
hypnagogic	
imagery	
.	

Polysomnographic	
monitoring	
shows	
that	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
occur	
during	
transitions	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
,	
mainly	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
the	
sleep	
episode	
.	

Superficial	
EMG	
recordings	
of	
the	
involved	
muscles	
show	
brief	
(	
generally	
75	
-	
millisecond	
to	
250	
-	
mil-	
lisecond	
)	
high	
-	
amplitude	
potentials	
,	
either	
singly	
or	
in	
succession	
.	

The	
EEG	
typically	
shows	
drowsiness	DISEASE
or	
stage	
N1	
sleep	
patterns	
,	
sometimes	
with	
a	
negative	
-	
vertex	
sharp	
wave	
occurring	
at	
the	
time	
of	
the	
jerk	
.	

Autonomic	
activation	
,	
including	
tachycardia	DISEASE
,	
tachypnea	DISEASE
or	
irregular	
breathing	
,	
and	
sudomotor	
activation	
may	
follow	
an	
intense	
jerk	
.	

After	
the	
jerk	
,	
a	
brief	
arousal	
or	
a	
return	
to	
sustained	
wakefulness	
may	
occur	
.	

Physical	
and	
neurological	
examinations	
and	
routine	
laboratory	
tests	
are	
otherwise	
normal	
.	

Although	
polysomnography	
is	
not	
necessary	
for	
diagnosis	
in	
most	
individuals	
,	
it	
may	
be	
indicated	
in	
occasional	
cases	
with	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
insomnia	DISEASE
and	
frequent	
movements	
.	

Hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
a	
number	
of	
physiological	
or	
pathologic	
movements	
that	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
or	
during	
sleep	
.	

Physiological	
partial	
hypnic	
myoclonus	DISEASE
consists	
of	
small	
,	
isolated	
contractions	
of	
a	
muscle	
or	
part	
thereof	
,	
occur-	
ring	
sporadically	
in	
distal	
muscles	
and	
resembling	
fasciculation	
potentials	
.	

The	
con-	
tractions	DISEASE
are	
particularly	
evident	
during	
stage	
N1	
and	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
consists	
of	
profuse	
,	
brief	
,	
small	
-	
amplitude	
muscle	
twitches	
that	
occur	
in	
an	
asynchronous	
,	
symmetrical	
,	
and	
bilateral	
manner	
,	
especially	
in	
distal	
muscles	
.	

Fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
occurs	
at	
sleep	
onset	
as	
well	
as	
within	
all	
sleep	
stages	
.	

Contrary	
to	
the	
massive	
jerks	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
the	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
starts	
or	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
,	
the	
small	
muscle	
twitches	
of	
physiological	
partial	
hypnic	
myoclonus	DISEASE
and	
of	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	DISEASE
often	
represent	
only	
an	
EMG	
finding	
and	
are	
not	
associated	
with	
overt	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
at	
the	
joints	
.	

Normal	
body	
movements	
are	
complex	
,	
with	
body	
postural	
shifts	
usually	
at	
the	
transition	
between	
one	
sleep	
stage	
and	
another	
.	

Benign	
sleep	
myoclonus	DISEASE
of	
infancy	
consists	
of	
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
at	
the	
elbow	
,	
fingers	
,	
toes	
,	
and	
face	
during	
sleep	
in	
infants	
.	

PSM	
is	
characterized	
by	
jerks	DISEASE
,	
usually	
spontaneous	
,	
but	
sometimes	
also	
evoked	
,	
arising	
first	
in	
spinal	
innervated	
axial	
muscles	
of	
the	
trunk	
,	
neck	
,	
or	
abdomen	
and	
then	
prop-	CHEMICAL
agated	
at	
slow	
velocity	
to	
more	
rostral	
and	
caudal	
muscles	
.	

PSM	
is	
present	
during	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
,	
characterized	
by	
diffuse	
EEG	
alpha	
activity	
,	
and	
disappears	
with	
sleep	
onset	
or	
mental	
activation	
.	

PSM	
is	
usually	
a	
chronic	
condition	
associated	
with	
sleep	
-	
onset	
insomnia	DISEASE
.	

Excessive	
startling	
and	
hypnic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
may	
occur	
as	
part	
of	
the	
hyperekplexia	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
in	
which	
generalized	
myoclonus	DISEASE
is	
readily	
elicited	
by	
stimuli	
during	
either	
wakeful-	
ness	
or	
sleep	
.	

The	
major	
form	
of	
this	
condition	
is	
also	
characterized	
by	
stiffness	
and	
falls	
.	

Brief	
epileptic	DISEASE
myoclonus	DISEASE
can	
be	
differentiated	
by	
coexistent	
EEG	
discharge	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
other	
features	
of	
epileptic	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
,	
and	
the	
occurrence	
of	
the	
myoclonus	DISEASE
in	
both	
wakefulness	
and	
during	
sleep	
rather	
than	
only	
at	
sleep	
onset	
.	

The	
muscle	
contractions	
of	
PLMD	DISEASE
are	
much	
longer	
in	
duration	
,	
involve	
mainly	
the	
feet	
and	
lower	
legs	
,	
show	
periodicity	
,	
and	
occur	
within	
sleep	
.	

RLS	DISEASE
consists	
of	
slower	
and	
repetitive	
semivoluntary	DISEASE
movements	DISEASE
at	
sleep	
onset	
that	
are	
associated	
with	
deep	
,	
unpleasant	
,	
and	
sometimes	
unbearable	
sensations	
,	
which	
are	
temporarily	
relieved	
by	
getting	
up	
and	
exercising

are	
listed	
here	
.	

This	
may	
be	
due	
to	
the	
fact	
that	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
overlaps	
more	
than	
one	
category	
or	
,	
more	
often	
,	
when	
insufficient	
data	
have	
been	
collected	
to	
firmly

another	
diagnosis	
.	

It	
is	
also	
possible	
that	
new

disorders	DISEASE
that	
do	
not	
fall	
within	
any	
of

covered	
during	
the	
lifetime	
of	
the	
International	
Classification	
of	
Sleep	
Disorders	
,	
3rd	
Edition	
.	

When	
a	
specific	
diagnosis	
can	
not	
yet	
be	
determined	
but	
the	
presenting	
problem	
clearly	
falls	
into	
a

category	
(	
e.g.	
,	
a	
circadian	
rhythm	
sleep

wake	
dis-	
order	
)	
,	
the

within	
that	
category	
(	
e.g.	
,	
circadian

)	
is

a

This

regarding	
whether

se	
.	

The	
condition	
is	
typically	
characterized	
by	
complaints	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
initiation	DISEASE
and/or	
maintenance	
that	
are	
the	
direct	
result	
of	
an	
environmental	
factor	
.	

Associated	
daytime	
symptoms	
such	
as	
sleepiness	DISEASE
,	
fatigue	DISEASE
,	
or	
cognitive	DISEASE
or	DISEASE
emotional	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
.	

The	
environmental	
disturbance	
may	
be	
a	
physical	
stimulus	
such	
as	
noise	
(	
e.g.	
,	
vehicular	
traffic	
,	
aircraft	
,	
bed	
partner	
snoring	DISEASE
)	
,	
light	
,	
temperature	
,	
movement	
(	
e.g.	
,	
bed	
partner	
movement	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
or	
parasomnia	DISEASE
)	
,	
an	
emotional	
stimulus	
such	
as	
environ-	DISEASE
mental	DISEASE
danger	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
combat	
setting	
or	
disaster	
area	
)	
,	
or	
an	
environmental	
requirement	
(	
such	
as	
caring	
for	
an	
infant	
or	
elderly	
family	
member	
)	
.	

Hospitalization	
is	
often	
cited	
as	
a	
precipitant	
of	
environmental	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
although	
many	
additional	
factors	
(	
e.g.	
,	
anxiety	DISEASE
or	
pain	DISEASE
)	
may	
also	
contribute	
to	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
in	
this	
setting	
.	

If	
the	
clinician	
determines	
that	
an	
environmental	
factor	
is	
the	
primary	
cause	
of	
a	
sleep	
distur-	
bance	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
Other	
Sleep	DISEASE
Disorder	DISEASE
may	
be	
employed	
.	

It	
is	
the	
physical	
aspects	
of	
the	
environment	
,	
rather	
than	
their	
psychological	
meaning	
,	
which	
account	
for	
the	
sleep	
complaint	
.	

Unlike	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
the	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
is	
dependent	
on	
the	
presence	
of	
the	
environmental	
factor	
.	

In	
the	
absence	
of	
the	
stimu-	
lus	
,	
sleep	
is	
normal	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbances	DISEASE
is	
not	
known	
although	
,	
as	
noted	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
is	
not	
commonly	
reported	
in	
sleep	
centers	
.	

Some	
individuals	
Other	
Sleep	DISEASE
Disorder	DISEASE
may	
be	
more	
susceptible	
to	
environmental	
disturbances	
but	
little	
is	
known	
about	
spe-	
cific	
characteristics	
that	
might	
predispose	
to	
this	
condition	
.	

Although	
environmental	
factors	
may	
play	
a	
contributing	
role	
in	
some	
cases	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
,	
multiple	
other	
factors	
account	
for	
that	
condition	
,	
which	
is	
typically	
evident	
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
the	
offending	
environmental	
stimulus	
.	

Distinguishing	
an	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
from	
an	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	DISEASE
disturbance	DISEASE
may	
pose	
a	
challenge	
in	
certain	
clinical	
encounters	
and	
providers	
must	
use	
clinical	
judgment	
in	
establishing	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

In	
behavioral	
insomnia	DISEASE
of	
childhood	
,	
the	
child	
may	
require	
certain	
environmental	
cir-	
cumstances	
in	
order	
to	
sleep	
(	
e.g.	
,	
a	
pacifier	
,	
music	
,	
lights	
,	
television	
,	
or	
a	
parent	
)	
.	

It	
is	
the	
absence	
of	
these	
circumstances	
that	
results	
in	
sleep	
initiation	
or	
maintenance	
prob-	
lems	
.	

In	
such	
cases	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
chronic	
insomnia	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
(	
behavioral	
insomnia	DISEASE
of	
childhood	
–	
sleep	
-	
onset

The	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
presented	
in	
this	
section	
may	
have	
a	
unique	
presentation	
during	
the	
sleep	
period	
or	
may	
present	
exclusively	
in	
association	
with	
sleep	
.	

Some	
of	
these	
disorders	
(	
e.g.	
,	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	DISEASE
and	
sleep	
related	
headache	DISEASE
)	
may	
be	
encountered	
during	
evaluation	
for	
other	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
some	
of	
these	
disorders	
are	
in	
the	
dif-	
ferential	
diagnosis	
of	
other	
sleep

Essential	
Features	
Fatal	
familial	
insomnia	DISEASE
is	
a	
very	
rare	
,	
progressive	
disorder	
characterized	
by	
initial	
dif-	
ficulties	
in	
falling	
asleep	
and	
maintaining	
sleep	
,	
spontaneous	
lapses	
from	
quiet	
wake-	
fulness	
into	
a	
sleep	
state	
with	
enacted	
dreams	
(	
oneiric	
stupor	
)	
,	
and	
loss	
of	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
features	
.	

In	
later	
stages	
of	
the	
disease	
,	
it	
may	
not	
be	
possible	
to	
identify	
any	
dis-	
tinct	
sleep	
stages	
.	

Although	
loss	
of	
temporal	
and	
spatial	
orientation	
develops	
,	
cognitive	
function	
is	
retained	
until	
impaired	
alertness	
makes	
testing	
impossible	
.	

The	
disorder	
progresses	
to	
unarousable	
coma	DISEASE
,	
and	
finally	
,	
death	DISEASE
.	

Associated	
Features	
Bronchopulmonary	DISEASE
and	
other	
infections	DISEASE
may	
also	
be	
present

There	
is

Course	
,	
and	
Complications	

The	
disorder	
is	
always	
fatal	
,	
usually	
within	
eight	
to	
72	
months	
.	

The	
course	
is	
one	
of	
relentless	
worsening	
of	
symptoms	
.	

Patients	
may	
die	
after	
a	
short	
(	
less	
than	
12	
months	
)	
or	
long	
(	
12	
to	
72	
months	
)	
disease	
course	
.	

The	
younger	
age	
at	
disease	
onset	
and	
,	
conse-	
quently	
,	
a	
lower	
rate	
of	
comorbidity	DISEASE
,	
may	
explain	
the	
generally	
more	
prolonged	
disease	
course	
in	
FFI	
in	
comparison	
to	
other	
prion	DISEASE
diseases	DISEASE
.	

Complications	
include	
infections	DISEASE
(	
in	
particular	
of	
the	
lungs	
and	
bladder	
)	
that	
develop	
during	
the	
course	
of	
the	
disease	
,	
especially	
in	
the	
late	
stages	
,	
and	
represent	
the	
usual	
cause	
of	
death	DISEASE
.	

Other	
frequent	
com-	
plications	
include	
skin	
ulcers	DISEASE
when	
patients	
become	
bedridden	
and	
aspiration	
of	
food	
due	
to	
the	
severe	
dysphagia	DISEASE
;	
the	
latter	
may	
require	
nasogastric

Essential	
Features	
A	
seizure	DISEASE
is	
a	
paroxysmal	
event	
resulting	
from	
a	
sudden	
excessive	
discharge	
of	
the	
neurons	
of	
the	
cerebral	
cortex	
,	
whereas	
epilepsy	DISEASE
is	
a	
condition	
of	
recurrent	
unpro-	
voked	
seizures	DISEASE
.	

Sleep	
facilitates	
epileptic	DISEASE
activity	
and	
seizures	DISEASE
.	

The	
characteristics	
of	
specific	
subtypes	
of	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	DISEASE
are	
discussed	
in	
the	
Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
section	
below	
.	

Associated	
Features	
The	
different	
types	
of	
nocturnal	
frontal	DISEASE
lobe	DISEASE
epilepsy	DISEASE
(	
NFLE	DISEASE
)	
may	
cause	
severe	
sleep	
disruption	
,	
affecting	
both	
macrostructure	
and	
microstructure	
of	
sleep	
,	
resulting	
in	
poor	
sleep	
quality	
,	
daytime	
fatigue	DISEASE
,	
and	
sleepiness	DISEASE
in	
some	
patients	
.	

The	
movements	
also	
may	
be	
so	
severe	
that	
injuries	DISEASE
can	
occur	
.	

From	
one	
third	
to	
one	
half	
of	
patients	
with	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	DISEASE
also	
have	
occasional	
attacks	DISEASE
during	
the	
day	
,	
although	
these	
are	
not	
necessarily	
of	
the	
same	
type	
as	
those	
occurring	
at	
night	
.	

Neurocognitive	DISEASE
impairment	DISEASE
is	
typically	
diagnosed	
in	
almost	
all	
cases	
of	
continuous	
spike	
waves	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
(	
CSWS	
)	
.	

Motor	
impairment	
in	
the	
form	
of	
a	
unilat-	
eral	
deficit	
is	
sometimes	
seen	
as	
an	
associated	
feature	
of	
CSWS	DISEASE
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
Clinical	
and	
EEG	
criteria	
are	
used	
to	
define	
a	
variety	
of	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	DISEASE
subtypes	
.	

Several	
types	
of	
epileptic	DISEASE
syndromes	DISEASE
have	
a	
marked	
tendency	
to	
manifest	
only	
or	
pre-	
dominantly	
during	
sleep	
,	
or	
after	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
.	

These	
include	
NFLE	DISEASE
,	
benign	
epilepsy	DISEASE
of	
childhood	
with	
centrotemporal	
spikes	
(	
BECT	DISEASE
)	
,

)

)	
,

,	
certain	
forms	
of

(	
as	
a	
component	
of	
Lennox	DISEASE

)	
,	
Landau	
-	
Kleffner	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
,	
and	
continuous	
spike	
waves	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
(	
CSWS	
)	
.	

NFLE	DISEASE
may	
present	
in	
three	
distinct	
ways	
:	
(	
1	
)	
nocturnal	
paroxysmal	
arousal	
,	
(	
2	
)	
noc-	
turnal	
paroxysmal	
dystonia	DISEASE
,	
or	
(	
3	
)	
episodic	
nocturnal	
wanderings	
.	

Appendix	
A	
:	
Sleep	
Related	
Medical	
and	
Neurological	DISEASE
Disorders	DISEASE
BECT	DISEASE
can	
present	
with	
focal	
clonic	
facial	
twitching	
that	
is	
often	
preceded	
by	
perioral	DISEASE
numbness	DISEASE
.	

These	
seizures	DISEASE
are	
more	
often	
seen	
in	
drowsiness	DISEASE
and	
sleep	
than	
wakeful-	
ness	
.	

The	
clinical	
course	
is	
often	
benign	
with	
disappearance	
of	
the	
seizures	DISEASE
in	
adulthood	
.	

BEOP	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
focal	
seizures	DISEASE
marked	
by	
deviation	
of	
the	
eyes	
and	
vom-	
iting	
.	

Sleep	
is	
the	
main	
precipitating	
factor	
,	
with	
most	
of	
the	
seizures	DISEASE
occurring	
soon	
after	
sleep	
onset	
or	
in	
the	
early	
hours	
of	
the	
morning	
.	

There	
is	
frequent	
evolution	
to	
secondary	
generalized	
attacks	
.	

The	
clinical	
evolution	
of	
the	
early	
-	
onset	
type	
is	
benign	
,	
whereas	
in	
the	
late	
-	
onset	
type	
with	
visual	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
,	
the	
prognosis	
is	
uncertain	
.	

JME	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
massive	
bilaterally	
synchronous	
myoclonic	DISEASE
jerks	DISEASE
,	
which	
are	
most	
frequently	
noted	
on	
awakening	
.	

CSWS	DISEASE
(	
formerly	
known	
as	
electrical	
status	DISEASE
epilepticus	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
[	DISEASE
ESES	DISEASE
]	
)	
is	
charac-	
terized	
by	
continuous	
and	
diffuse	
slow	
spike	
-	
and	
-	
wave	
complexes	
persisting	
through	
NREM	
sleep	
(	
at	
least	
85	
%	
of	
the	
duration	
)	
,	
as	
well	
as	
neuropsychological	
and	
motor	
impairment	
.	

Despite	
the	
continuous	
presence	
of	
epileptic	DISEASE
spike	
-	
wave	
activity	
on	
EEG	
in	
sleep	
,	
there	
may	
be	
no	
associated	
visible	
sleep	
related	
movement	
.	

However	
,	
clinical	
epileptic	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
are	
sometimes	
seen	
in	
the	
daytime	
.	

Demographics	
There	
is	
no	
significant

.	

Predisposing	
and	
Participating	
Factors	
Stress	
,	
sleep	
deprivation	
,	
irregularities	
of	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
rhythm	
,	
other	
sleep	
patholo-	
gies	
,	
and	
the	
use	
of	
stimulant	
drugs	
or	
other	
drugs	
that	
modify	
sleep	
architecture	
may	
predispose	
an	
individual	
to	
having	
seizures	DISEASE
.	

Perinatal	
or	
prenatal	
problems	
,	
congenital	DISEASE
hemiparesis	DISEASE
,	
and	
prior	
encephalopathy	DISEASE
may	
be	
considered	
antecedents	
of	
the	
syndrome	
of	
CSWS	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE
may	
exacerbate	
sleep	
related	
seizures	DISEASE
and	
complicate	
their	
treatment	
.	

Familial	
Patterns	

The	
idiopathic	DISEASE
generalized	DISEASE
epilepsies	DISEASE
form	
the	
largest	
category	
of	
epilepsies	DISEASE
that	
appear	
to	
be	
heritable	
but	
show	
no	
clear	
mendelian	
mode	
of	
transmission	
.	

Juvenile	DISEASE
myoclonic	DISEASE
epilepsy	DISEASE
and	
idiopathic	DISEASE
generalized	DISEASE
epilepsy	DISEASE
with	
adolescent	
onset	
appear	
to	
be	
genet-	
ically	
heterogeneous	
.	

Among	
the	
partial	DISEASE
epilepsies	DISEASE
,	
BECT	DISEASE
shows	
a	
familial	
pattern	
.	

A	
form	
of	
autosomal	DISEASE
dominant	DISEASE
NFLE	DISEASE
with	
70	
%	
to	
80	
%	
penetrance	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
many	
countries	
,	
and	
a	
genetic	
heterogeneity	
also	
has	
been	
reported	
.	

Genetic	
factors	
have	
not	
been	
established	
in	
CSWS	DISEASE
and	
seem	
to	
play	
a	
minor	
role	
.	

Familial	
anteced-	
ents	
of	
epilepsy	DISEASE
(	
including	
febrile	DISEASE
convulsions	DISEASE
)	
have	
been	
found	
in	
15	
%	
of	
cases	
.

Complications	
Idiopathic	DISEASE
generalized	DISEASE
epilepsies	DISEASE
and	
partial	DISEASE
epilepsy	DISEASE
may	
start	
at	
any	
age	
.	

The	
onset	
of	
benign	
epilepsies	DISEASE
of	
childhood	
with	
centrotemporal	
or	
occipital	
spikes	
is	
between	
4	
and	
12	
years	
of	
age	
.	

The	
onset	
of	
NFLE	DISEASE
is	
generally	
from	
age	
10	
to	
16	
years	
,	
mostly	
before	
the	
age	
of	
20	
years	
.	

The	
average	
age	
of	
recognition	
of	
CSWS	DISEASE
is	
between	
4	
and	
14	
years	
,	
but	
the	
appearance	
of	
the	
first	
seizure	DISEASE
is	
early	
,	
typically	
between	
two	
months	
and	
12	
years	
of	
age	
.	

Most	
patients	
with	
recurrent	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	DISEASE
continue	
to	
have	
seizures	DISEASE
restricted	
to	
sleep	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
they	
may	
have	
seizures	DISEASE
during	
both	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

For	
focal	
epilepsies	DISEASE
(	
excluding	
BECT	DISEASE
and	
the	
early	
-	
onset	
type	
of	
BEOP	DISEASE
)	
,	
the	
prognosis	
is	
less	
favorable	
compared	
to	
generalized	
epilepsies	DISEASE
.	

At	
least	
35	
%	
of	
the	
focal	
seizures	DISEASE
confined	
to	
sleep	
are	
resistant	
to	
antiepileptic	
drugs	
.	

Definitive	
data	
on	
the	
natural	
history	
of	
NFLE	DISEASE
are	
not	
available	
,	
although	
a	
high	
prev-	
alence	
of	
parasomnias	DISEASE
has	
been	
documented	
in	
NFLE	DISEASE
patients	
.	

CSWS	DISEASE
resolves	
in	
many	
cases	
within	
three	
years	
after	
onset	
,	
and	
in	
almost	
all	
cases	
by	
the	
mid	
-	
teen	
years	
.	

Despite	
normalization	
of	
the	
EEG	
and	
elimination	
of	
seizures	DISEASE
,	
neuropsychological	
impairment	
may	
persist	
.	

Interictal	
paroxysmal	
activity	
may	
induce	
prolonged	
cognitive	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
motor	DISEASE
impairment	DISEASE
.	

Hyperkinesias	DISEASE
,	
aggressiveness	DISEASE
,	
and	
psy-	
chotic	
states	
may	
appear	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
may	
exacerbate	
sleep

seizures	DISEASE
and	
complicate	
their	
treatment	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
In	
idiopathic	DISEASE
generalized	DISEASE
epilepsy	DISEASE
,	
genetic	
factors	
are	
contributory	
.	

Pathogenic	
markers	
,	
associated	
neurologic	DISEASE
deficits	DISEASE
,	
or	
characteristic	
brain	
imaging	
findings	
have	
not	
been	
identified	
.	

However	
,	
microdysgenesis	DISEASE
has	
been	
described	
in	
some	
forms	
of	
idiopathic	DISEASE
generalized	DISEASE
epilepsy	DISEASE
.	

EEG	
recordings	
with	
sphenoidal	
or	
zygomatic	
leads	
may	
show	
epileptic	DISEASE
activity	
over	
the	
mesiotemporal	
regions	
in	
partial	
complex	
seizures	DISEASE
.	

Video	
-	
polysomnographic	
(	
vPSG	
)	
analysis	
confirms	
that	
the	
motor	
pattern	
of	
NFLE	DISEASE
resembles	
that	
noted	
in	
orbital	
and	
mesial	DISEASE
frontal	DISEASE
seizures	DISEASE
.	

Nocturnal	
frontal	
lobe	
sei-	

zures	
involve	
a	
large	
neuronal	
network	
,	
and	
some	
of	
their	
clinical	
expressions	
are	
pos-	
sible	
consequences	
of	
disinhibition	
of	
innate	
motor	
patterns	
produced	
by	
the	
central	
pattern	
generator	
.	

Recent	
reports	
derived	
from	
stereo	
-	
EEG	
studies	
seem	
to	
show	
that	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
the	
seizures	DISEASE
(	
in	
particular	
nocturnal	
wanderings	
)	
may	
arise	
from	
temporal	
or	
insular	
regions	
(	
rather	
than	
frontal	
regions	
)	
with	
a	
secondary	
spread	
to	
the	
cingulate	
regions	
.	

They	
may	
sometimes	
mimic	
parasomnias	DISEASE
.	

Appendix

Secondary	
bilateral	
synchrony	
is	
the	
mechanism	
generating

This	
hypothesis	
is	
supported	
by	
EEG	
,	
intracranial	
recordings	
,	
EEG	
with

computer

,	
and	
metabolic

studies

CSWS	DISEASE
associated	
with	
Landau	
-	
Kleffner	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
(	
an	
acquired	
epileptic	DISEASE
aphasia	DISEASE
)	
is	
probably	
secondary	
to	
an	
alteration	
of	
function	
over	
the	
temporal	
area	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Patients	
with	
suspected	
sleep	
related	
epilepsy	DISEASE
often	
need	
to	
be	
evaluated	
in	
the	
sleep	
laboratory	
with	
video	
and	
full	
-	
head	
EEG	
monitoring	
in	
order	
to	
obtain	
the	
correct	
diagnosis	
.	

The	
characteristic	
interictal	
epileptiform	
activity	
in	
idiopathic	
general-	
ized	
epilepsies	DISEASE
usually	
increases	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
whereas	
it	
decreases	
during	
REM	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
.	

Interictal	
epileptiform	
activity	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
phasic	
arousals	DISEASE
.	

In	
partial	
epilepsies	DISEASE
,	
the	
interictal	
epileptiform	
activity	
occurs	
in	
a	
localized	
distribu-	
tion	
with	
an	
increase	
in	
spike	
frequency	
in	
stages	
N2	
and	
N3	
compared	
to	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Most	
of	
the	
seizures	DISEASE
are	
activated	
in	
stage	
N2	
sleep	
.	

Monitoring	
may	
also	
detect	
tran-	
sient	
autonomic	
alterations	
in	
cardiac	
rhythm	
,	
blood	
pressure	
,	
and	
respiration	
during	
seizures	DISEASE
.	

If	
epilepsy	DISEASE
is	
suspected	
,	
a	
standard	
daytime	
16	
-	
channel	
to	
20	
-	
channel	
EEG	
(	
with	
partial	
or	
total	
sleep	
deprivation	
the	
night	
before	
,	
as	
indicated	
)	
should	
be	
per-	
formed	
.	

Ambulatory	
24	
-	
hour	
EEG	
recordings	
may	
be	
useful	
to	
detect	
distribution	
of	
interictal	
epileptiform	
activity	
during	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
.	

Nocturnal	
vPSG	
is	
the	
gold	
standard	
test	
for	
NFLE	DISEASE
.	

Most	
of	
the	
seizures	DISEASE
appear	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
with	
preponderance	
in	
NREM	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
(	
greater	
than	
60	
%	
)	
.	

Rarely	
do	
they	
emerge	
from	
REM	
sleep	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
particularly	
in	
paroxysmal	
arousals	DISEASE
,	
the	
motor	
attacks	
may	
show	
a	
periodicity	
(	
every	
20	
seconds	
to	
two	
minutes	
)	
.	

Due	
to	
the	
fact	
that	
the	
discharges	
originate	
deep	
in	
the	
frontal	
lobe	
and	
are	
not	
visible	
using	
scalp	
EEG	
,	
the	
EEG	
during	
the	
attacks	DISEASE
is	
uninformative	
in	
almost	
half	
of	
the	
cases	
.	

In	
a	
few	
cases	
,	
recording	
using	
intracranial	
or	
depth	
electrodes	
confirms	
the	
paroxysms	DISEASE
during	
or	
preceding	
the	
motor	
components	
.	

The	
interictal	
sleep	
EEG	
is	
generally	
normal	
,	
but

30	
%	
to	
40	
%	
of

abnormalities	DISEASE
are	
seen

predominantly	
in	
the	
anterior	
regions

The	
video	
recording	
of	
the	
different	
types	
of	
attacks	
in	
NFLE	DISEASE
permits	
categorization	
of	
the	
seizures	DISEASE

characterization	
of	
the	
main	
features	
.	

During	
CSWS	DISEASE
,	
diffuse	
spike	
waves	
at	
two	
to	
2.5	
Hz	
occur	
in	
bursts	
,	
with	
or	
without	
clinical	
manifestations	
.	

The	
discharges	
are	
continuous	
and	
occupy	
from	
85	
%	
to	
100	
%

stages

Abnormalities	
arise	
as	
soon	
as	
the	
patients	
fall	
asleep	
and	
dis-	
appear	
abruptly	
on	
awakening	
.	

REM	
sleep	
is	
typically	
preserved	
,	
and	
the	
frequency	
of	
spike	
-	
wave	
discharges	
significantly	
decreases	
but	
the	
frontal	
predominance	
of	
the	
infrequent	
bursts	
may	
become	
more	
prominent	
.	

In	
general	
,	
EEG	
patterns	
during	
REM	
sleep	
are	
similar	
to	
those	
in	
the	
awake	
records	
.	

The	
sleep	
structure	
is	
normal	
,	
but	
the	
presence	
of	
almost	
continuous	
spike	
-	
wave	
discharges	
makes	
the	
recognition	
of

elements	
(	
such	
as

Differential	
Diagnosis	
NFLE	DISEASE
may	
be	
mistaken	
for	
a	
disorder	
of	
arousal	
from	
NREM	
such	
as	
sleepwalking	
,	
confusional	
arousal	
,	
or	
sleep	
terror	
.	

Ictal	
and	
interictal	
EEGs	
are	
often	
normal	
because	
the	
focus	
for	
the	
epileptic	DISEASE
discharge	
may	
be	
deep	
in	
the	
brain	
.	

Disorders	
of	
arousal	
show	
a	
different	
pattern	
of	
episodes	
in	
that	
they	
occur	
out	
of	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
,	
are	
not	
ste-	
reotyped	
,	
often	
have	
a	
sustained	
autonomic	
component	
,	
and	
are	
frequently	
seen	
during	
the	
first	
part	
of	
the	
night

disorders	DISEASE
tend	
to

often	
useful

Sleep	
talking	
,	
bruxism	DISEASE

and	
rhythmic

disorders	
can	
be	
differentiated	
from	
nocturnal	DISEASE

by	
history	
and

myoclonus	DISEASE
may	
be	
confused	
with

myoc-	
lonic	
seizures	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
.	

In	
the	
elderly	
(	
older	
than	
60	
years	
)	
,	
the	
main	
differentiation	
from	
RBD	DISEASE
is	
by	
vPSG	
recording	
.	

PLMD	DISEASE

and	
propriospinal	
myoclonus	DISEASE
at

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
are	
a	
group	
of	
unilateral	
or	
bilateral	
cephalalgias	DISEASE
of	
varying	
severity	
and	
duration	
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
or	
upon	
awakening	
from	
sleep	
.	

It	
is	
a	
heterogenous	
group	
of	
different	
headache	DISEASE
entities	
with	
the	
common	
feature	
of	
occur-	
rence	
during	
sleep	
or	
upon	
awakening	
.	

The	
characteristics	
of	
specific	
subtypes	
of	
sleep	
related	
headache	DISEASE
are	
discussed	
in	
the	
Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
section	
below	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Individual	
features	
associated	
with	
specific	
sleep	
related	
headache	DISEASE
types	
are	
discussed	
in	
the	
following	
section	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathologic	
Subtypes	
Most	
sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
are	
daytime	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
conditions	
that	
also	
may	
occur	
during	
sleep	
.	

These	
include	
the	
primary	
headaches	DISEASE
such	
as	
migraine	DISEASE
,	
cluster	DISEASE
head-	DISEASE
ache	DISEASE
,	
and	
chronic	
paroxysmal	
hemicrania	DISEASE
.	

There	
are	
other	
primary	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
that	
occur	
solely	
with	
sleep	
;	
for	
example	
,	
hypnic	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
.	

In	
addition	
,	
secondary	
head-	
aches	DISEASE
related	
to	
medical	
,	
neurological	
,	
psychiatric	DISEASE
,	
and	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
can	
cause	
sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
.	

Migraines	DISEASE
are	
common	
recurrent	
headaches	DISEASE
of	
moderate	
to	
severe	
intensity	
that	
last	
between	
four	
and	
72	
hours	
.	

Pain	DISEASE
is	
typically	
unilateral	
and	
pulsating	
,	
aggra-	
vated	
by	
routine	
physical	
activity	
and	
associated	
with	
nausea	DISEASE
,	
and/or	
photophobia	
Appendix	
A	
:	
Sleep	
Related	
Medical	
and	
Neurological	
Disorders	
or	
phonophobia	DISEASE
.	

They	
occur	
during	
the	
day	
or	
during	
sleep	
;	
approximately	
50	
%	
of	
migraine	DISEASE
attacks	
occur	
between	
4:00	
a.m.	
and	
9:00	
a.m.	

Migraine	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
do	
not	
have	
a	
fixed	
association	
with	
a	
particular	
sleep	
stage	
.	

The	
patient	
may	
awaken	
with	
a	
migraine	DISEASE
out	
of	
REM	
sleep	
,	
or	
the	
headaches	DISEASE
may	
occur	
in	
relationship	
to	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

A	
“	
classic	
migraine	DISEASE
”	
headache	DISEASE
is	
preceded	
by	
an	
aura	
(	
if	
the	
patient	
is	
awake	
)	
,	
which	
usually	
lasts	
four	
to	
60	
minutes	
and	
typically	
consists	
of	
homonymous	DISEASE
visual	DISEASE
field	DISEASE
defects	DISEASE
and	
scintillating	
scotomas	DISEASE
.	

In	
some	
patients	
,	
the	
aura	
may	
continue	
or	
even	
begin	
during	
the	
headache	DISEASE
phase	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
“	
common	
migraine	DISEASE
”	
does	
not	
start	
with	
an	
aura	
.	

Other	
signs	
of	
neurological	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
may	
include	
unilateral	
paresthesias	DISEASE
,	
weakness	DISEASE
,	
and	
aphasia	DISEASE
.	

Features	
of	
brainstem	
involvement	
may	
include	
vertigo	DISEASE
,	
tinni-	
tus	
,	
dysarthria	DISEASE
,	
decreased	DISEASE
hearing	DISEASE
,	
diplopia	DISEASE
,	
ataxia	DISEASE
,	
bilateral	
paresthesias	DISEASE
,	
and	
impaired	
level	
of	
consciousness	
.	

A	
familial	DISEASE
syndrome	DISEASE
with	
hemiplegia	DISEASE
is	
well	
described	
.	

The	
hemiplegia	DISEASE
is	
ipsilateral	
or	
contralateral	
to	
the	
side	
of	
the	
headache	DISEASE
.	

Cluster	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
are	
severe	
,	
unilateral	
,	
periorbital	
or	
temporal	
headaches	DISEASE
that	
start	
quickly	
and	
peak	
within	
10	
to	
15	
minutes	
.	

They	
have	
a	
relatively	
shorter	
duration	
,	
usually	
lasting	
15	
minutes	
to	
three	
hours	
(	
mean	
,	
60	
minutes	
)	
.	

The	
headaches	DISEASE
occur	
daily	
during	
cluster	
periods	
—	
usually	
one	
to	
three	
attacks	
per	
day	
over	
a	
period	
of	
one	
to	
two	
months	
.	

Most	
patients	
have	
one	
cluster	
period	
per	
year	
,	
though	
this	
can	
vary	
from	
patient	
to	
patient	
.	

The	
headaches	DISEASE
tend	
to	
occur	
at	
the	
same	
hour	
each	
day	
,	
with	
75	
%	
of	
cluster	
episodes	
reported	
to	
occur	
between	
9:00	
p.m.	
and	
10:00	
a.m.	

One	
or	
more	
cranial	
autonomic	
features	
(	
e.g.	
,	
ipsilateral	
conjunctival	DISEASE
injection	DISEASE
,	
lacrimation	
,	
nasal	DISEASE
congestion	DISEASE
,	
rhinorrhea	DISEASE
,	
forehead	
and	
facial	
sweating	
,	
miosis	DISEASE
,	
ptosis	DISEASE
,	
or	
eyelid	DISEASE
edema	DISEASE
)	
invariably	
accompany	
attacks	
of	
cluster	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
.	

A	
strong	
predilection	
for	
attacks	DISEASE
to	
occur	
during	
sleep	
is	
well	
recognized	
,	
and	
these	
attacks	
are	
strongly	
related	
to	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Chronic	DISEASE
paroxysmal	DISEASE
hemicrania	DISEASE
closely	
resembles	
cluster	
headaches	DISEASE
and	
consists	
of	
severe	
unilateral	
orbital	
,	
supraorbital	
,	
or	
temporal	
pain	DISEASE
associated	
with	
one	
or	
more	
cranial	
autonomic	
features	
.	

However	
,	
the	
attacks	DISEASE
are	
usually	
of	
shorter	
duration	
(	
lasting	
two	
to	
30	
minutes	
)	
and	
occur	
more	
frequently	
,	
most	
often	
at	
a	
frequency	
of	
more	
than	
five	
per	
day	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
cluster	
headaches	DISEASE
,	
chronic	DISEASE
paroxysmal	DISEASE
hemicrania	DISEASE
is	
exqui-	
sitely	
sensitive	
to	
indomethacin	CHEMICAL
.	

Attacks	
are	
also	
strongly	
associated	
with	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Hypnic	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
are	
an	
uncommon	
type	
of	
headache	DISEASE
that	
awakens	
the	
patient	
from	
sleep	
with	
a	
generalized	
or	
lateralized	
headache	DISEASE
that	
lasts	
at	
least	
15	
minutes	
(	
range	
,	
one	
to	
180	
minutes	
)	
with	
a	
frequency	
of	
at	
least	
15	
times	
per	
month	
.	

Onset	
is	
typically	
after	
the	
age	
of	
50	
,	
although	
similar	
headaches	DISEASE
are	
described	
rarely	
in	
younger	
indi-	
viduals	
,	
including	
children	
.	

In	
comparison	
to	
cluster	
headaches	DISEASE
,	
hypnic	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
are	
Appendix

Disorders	
less	
severe	
,	
often	
bilateral	
and	
not	
associated	
with	
cranial	
autonomic	
features	
.	

Isolated	
nausea	DISEASE
,	
photophobia	DISEASE
,	
or	
phonophobia	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
.	

They	
may	
occur	
one	
to	
three	
times	
during	
the	
night	
,	
with	
many	
patients	
reporting	
that	
the	
headaches	DISEASE
occur	
at	
the	
same	
time	
of	
the	
night	
.	

The	
headaches	DISEASE
tend	
to	
occur	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
they	
also	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
occur	
during	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

A	
positive	
therapeutic	
response	
to	
lithium	CHEMICAL
,	
indomethacin	CHEMICAL
,	
and	
caffeine	CHEMICAL
has	
been	
reported	
in	
many	
patients	
.	

Other	
medical	
(	
e.g.	
,	
hypertension	DISEASE
)	
,	
neurologic	
(	
e.g.

venous	DISEASE
thrombosis	DISEASE
and	
trauma	DISEASE
)	
,	
psychiatric	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
depression	DISEASE
)	
,	
and	
sleep	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
(	
e.g.	
,	
snoring	DISEASE
and	
OSA	DISEASE
)	
also	
can	
give	
rise	
to	
headaches	DISEASE
that	
may	
occur	
during	
sleep	
or	
upon	
awakening	
from	
sleep	
.	

Patients	
with	
increased	
intracranial	
pressure	
(	
due	
,	
for	
example	
,	
to	
brain	
tumor	DISEASE
,	
hematoma	DISEASE
,	
arteriovenous	DISEASE
malformations	DISEASE
,	
or	
cerebral	DISEASE
venous	DISEASE
thrombosis	DISEASE
)	
may	
complain	
of	
headache	DISEASE
in	
the	
morning	
or	
head-	
ache	DISEASE
that	
starts	
after	
recumbence	
and	
improves	
after	
the	
patient	
is	
up	
for	
30	
to	
60	
minutes	
.	

Nausea	DISEASE
,	DISEASE
vomiting	DISEASE
,	
signs	
of	
focal	
neurological	DISEASE
deficits	DISEASE
,	
and	
papilledema	DISEASE
may	
be	
present	
.	

The	
headache	DISEASE
may	
worsen	
with	
bending	
down	
or	
sneezing	DISEASE
or	
with	
other	
activities	
that	
may	
cause	
further	
increase	
in	
intracranial	
pressure	
.	

Sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
can	
disrupt	
nocturnal	
sleep	
,	
although	
the	
exact	
prevalence	
of	
this	
complication	
is	
unknown	
.	

Demographics	
The	
exact	
prevalence	
of	
sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
is	
not	
known	
.	

One	
study	
from	
a	
head-	
ache	DISEASE
clinic	
suggested	
that	
17	
%	
of	
all	
headache	DISEASE
patients	
complain	
of	
nocturnal	
or	
early	
morning	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
,	
and	
roughly	
half	
of	
these	
were	
related	
to	
an	
identifiable	
sleep	DISEASE
disorder	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
many	
primary	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
can	
occur	
during	
sleep	
as	
well	
.	

Sleep

.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Migraine	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
have	
several	
predisposing	
factors	
that	
vary	
from	
patient	
to	
patient	
.	

However	
,	
stress	
,	
relaxation	
,	
changes	
in	
weather	
and	
barometric	
pressure	
,	
changes	
in	
sleep	
pattern	
,	
hypoglycemia	DISEASE
,	
and	
specific	
foods	
(	
e.g.	
,	
chocolate	
,	
Chinese	
food	
,	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
)	
have	
been	
known	
to	
trigger	
migraine	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
.	

Alcohol	CHEMICAL
can	
also	
predispose	
an	
indi-	
vidual	
to	
having	
cluster	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
and	
chronic	DISEASE
paroxysmal	DISEASE
hemicrania	DISEASE
.	

OSA	DISEASE
and	
atten-	
dant	
hypoxia	DISEASE
have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
a	
trigger	
for	
cluster	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
sleep	DISEASE
apnea	DISEASE
may	
also	
predispose	
a	
person	
to	
having	
other	
types	
of	
headache	DISEASE
and	
may	
inde-	
pendently	
lead	
to	
morning	
headaches	DISEASE
.	

Change	
of	
sleep	
pattern	
and	
insomnia	DISEASE
can	
pre-	
dispose	
the	
patient	
to	
developing	
headaches	DISEASE
.

Familial	DISEASE
hemiplegic	DISEASE
migraine	DISEASE
is	
inherited	
in	
an	
autosomal	
dominant	
pattern	
with	
a	
variety	
of	
genetic	
mutations	
identified	
on

Cluster	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
does	
not	
have

migraine	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
,	
but	
first

relatives	
of	
probands	
with	
cluster	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
are	
seven	
times	
more	
likely	
to

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
Migraine	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
usually	
starts	
in	
the	
second	
or	
third	
decade	
of	
life	
,	
with	
a	
slightly	
earlier	
onset	
in	
men	
than	
in	
women	
.	

The	
mean	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
cluster	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
is	
28	
years	
.	

Chronic	DISEASE
paroxysmal	DISEASE
hemicrania	DISEASE
has	
a	
wide	
range	
of	
onset	
,	
from	
childhood	
to	
old	
age	
.	

Most	
patients	
with	
hypnic	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
are	
elderly	
,	
with	
the	
age	
of	
onset	
from	
40	
to	
82	
years	
.	

Brain	DISEASE
tumors	DISEASE
are	
more	
prevalent	
in	
the	
elderly	
,	
most	
occurring	
from	
the	
fifth	
decade	
to	
late	
life	
.	

Most	
sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
are	
benign	
and	
tend	
to	
decrease	
in	
frequency	
with	
age	
.	

There	
may	
be	
spontaneous	
remissions	
that	
last	
from	
months	
to	
years	
.	

Pregnancy	
has	
a	
variable	
effect	
on	
these	
headaches	DISEASE
.	

Migraines	DISEASE
tend	
to	
decrease	
with	
age	
and	
,	
in	
women	
,	
may	
stop	
after	
menopause	
.	

Cluster	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
,	
as	
the	
name	
suggests	
,	
occur	
in	
clusters	
and	
are	
accompanied	
by	
pain	DISEASE
-	
free	
intervals	
lasting	
months	
to	
a	
couple	
of	
years	
.	

They	
also	
tend	
to	
decrease	
with	
age	
.	

Hypnic	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
occurs	
infrequently	
.	

Headaches	DISEASE
in	
patients	
with	
brain	DISEASE
tumors	DISEASE
are	
related	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
intracranial	
pressure	
and	
tend	
to	
improve	
with	
treatment	
of	
the	
primary	
lesion	
and	
a	
decrease	
in	
intracranial	
pres-	
sure	
.	

Some	
patients	
with	
OSA	DISEASE
report	
improvement	
of	
the	
headache	DISEASE
after	
treatment	
of	
the	
apnea	DISEASE
.	

The	
sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
can	
cause	
sleep	
disruption	
and	
insomnia	DISEASE
with	
decreased	
sleep	
efficiency	
.	

Cluster	DISEASE
headaches	DISEASE
occurring	
regularly	
in	
sleep	
can	
also	
lead	
to	
tran-	
sient	
situational	
insomnia	DISEASE
that	
may	
resolve	
after	
the	
remission	
or	
the	
treatment	
of	
the	
cluster	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Several	
anatomic	
areas	
are	
common	
to	
the	
physiology	
of	
both	
sleep	
and	
headaches	DISEASE
;	
these	
include	
the	
brainstem	
and	
diencephalon	
,	
specifically	
the	
ventrolateral	
periaque-	
ductal	
gray	
and	
the	
posterior	
hypothalamus	
.	

From	
a	
neurochemical	
perspective	
,	
ade-	
nosine	CHEMICAL
,	
melatonin	CHEMICAL
,	
and	
orexin	
also	
are	
involved	
in	
both	
the	
regulation	
of	
sleep	
and	
the	
evolution	
of	
headaches	DISEASE
.	

Dysfunction	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
REM	DISEASE
sleep	DISEASE
and	DISEASE
arousal	DISEASE
mechanisms	DISEASE
are	DISEASE
common	DISEASE
to	DISEASE
many	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
disorders	DISEASE
.	

Data	
from	
transgenic	
models	
indicate	
that	
dis-	
ruption	
of	
sleep	
occurs	
in	
two	
forms	
of	
familial	
migraine	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
current	
mechanis-	
tic	
explanations	
of	
the	
relationship	
between	
sleep	
and	
headache	DISEASE
are	
speculative	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Polysomnographic	
aspects	
of	
sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
need	
to	
be	
better	
defined	
.	

Migraine	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
is	
reported	
to	
occur	
in	
association	
with	
REM	
sleep	
or	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

An	
excess	
of	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
also	
has	
been	
reported	
in	
patients	
with	
migraine	DISEASE
.	

However	
,	
large	
controlled	
studies	
are	
not	
available	
.	

Fifty	
percent	
of	
cluster	
headaches	DISEASE
and	
a	
majority	
of	
chronic	
paroxysmal	
hemicrania	DISEASE
are	
associated	
with	
REM	
sleep	
.	

OSA	DISEASE
and	
hypoxia	DISEASE
during	
sleep	
may	
aggravate	
other	
sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
or	
may	
be	
an	
independent	
cause	
of	
headache	DISEASE
.	

Hypnic	DISEASE
headache	DISEASE
occurs	
during	
sleep	
,	
with	
recent	
reports	
of	
headache	DISEASE
during	
REM	
sleep	
and	
uncommonly	
during	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

Thus	
,	
the	
majority	
of	
sleep	
related	
headaches	DISEASE
seem	
to	
have	
some	
relationship	
with	
REM	
sleep	
,	
but	
there	
are	
no	
defining	
or	
pathognomonic	
polysomnographic	
aspects	
of	
indi-	
vidual	
headache	DISEASE

.	

Neuroimaging	
studies	
(	
computed	
tomography	
or	
magnetic	
resonance	
imaging	
head

)	
may	
be	
performed	
to	
rule	
out	
structural	
,	
vascular	
,	
or	
infectious	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
processes	
that	
may	
cause	
headaches	DISEASE

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Sleep

headaches	DISEASE
are	
a	
heterogeneous	
group	
of	
different	
headache	DISEASE
entities	
with	
a	
common	
expression	
of	
occurrence	
during	
sleep	
.	

They	
need	
to	
be	
differentiated	
from	
other	
headache	DISEASE
conditions	
that	
are	
not

.	

These	
include

a	
disorder	
in	
which	
tracheal	DISEASE
muscle	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
or	
para-	
tracheal	
soft	
-	
tissue	
swelling	DISEASE
causes	
stridor	DISEASE
or	
interruption	
of	
airflow	
,	
with	
associated	
awakening	
from	
sleep	
.	

Patients	
may	
have	
total	
or	
near	
-	
total	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
while	
asleep	
,	
and	
suddenly	
arouse	
.	

This	
brief	
respiratory	DISEASE
blockage	DISEASE
(	
lasting	
an	
estimated	
five	
to	
45	
seconds	
)	
is	
often	
followed	
by	
a	
period	
of	
stridor	DISEASE
that	
lasts	
several	
minutes	
and	
gradually	
evolves	
to	
normal	
breathing	
.	

Episodes	
are	
associated	
with	
panic	DISEASE
and	
fear	
of	
suffocation	DISEASE
;	
cyanosis	DISEASE
may	
be	
observed	
.	

In

Essential	
Features	
Sleep

gastroesophageal	
reflux	
(	
GER	DISEASE
)	
occurs	
when	
gastric	
contents	
cross	
the	
lower	
esophageal	
sphincter	
(	
LES	
)	
into	
the	
esophagus	
and	
,	
potentially	
,	
into	
more	
prox-

sites	
during	
sleep	
time	
.	

Symptoms	
are	
usually	
noticed

Thus	
,	
GER	DISEASE
symptoms	
during	
sleep

are	
common	
.	

There	
is	
no	
known	
predilection	
for

However	
,	
men	
are	
more

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Predisposing	
factors	
for	
sleep	
related	
GER	DISEASE
include	
eating	
within	
two	
hours	
of

,	
an	
elevated	
body	
mass	
index	
,	
erosive	
esophagitis	DISEASE
,	
and	
hiatal	
hernia	DISEASE
.	

Predictors	
of	
heart-	
burn	
during	
sleep	
include	
consumption	
of	
alcohol	CHEMICAL
or	
carbonated	
beverages	
,	
or	
the	
use	
of	
benzodiazepines	CHEMICAL
before	
sleep

of	
insomnia	DISEASE
,	
hypertension	DISEASE
,	
asthma	DISEASE
,

The	
relationship	
between	
GER	DISEASE
and

it	
may	
be	
controlled

Sleep

and	
Neurological	
Disorders	
Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Two	
major	
pathophysiologic	
mechanisms	
cause	
individual	
reflux	DISEASE
episodes	
.	

Transient	
LES	
relaxations	
(	
LES	
relaxations	
occurring	
without	
esophageal	
contractions	
)	
account	
for	
53	
%	
to	
74	
%	
of	
GER	DISEASE
episodes	
.	

Transient	
LES	DISEASE
relaxations	DISEASE
decrease	
the	
LES	
pres-	
sure	
to	
the	
gastric	
pressure	
gradient	
,	
facilitating	
the	
retrograde	
flow	
of	
gastric	
contents	
.	

An	
LES	
pressure	
of	
10	
mm	
Hg	
or	
less	
is	
the	
second	
mechanism	
by	
which	
intra	
-	
abdom-	
inal	
pressure	
overcomes	
the	
LES	
pressure	
,	
resulting	
in	
the	
retrograde	
flow	
of	
gastric	
contents	
into	
the	
esophagus	
.	

Pathophysiology	
of	
sleep	
related	
GER	DISEASE
is	
similar	
to	
diurnal	
GER	DISEASE
(	
i.e.	
,	
transient	
LES	
relaxations	
and	
a	
low	
LES	
pressure	
)	
.	

However	
,	
sleep	
impacts	
esophageal	
physiology	
through	
the	
impairment	
of	
esophageal	
acid	
clearance	
mechanisms	
when	
GER	DISEASE
events	
occur	
.	

With	
sleep	
onset	
,	
the	
upper	
esophageal	
sphincter	
(	
UES	
)	
pressure	
decreases	
and	
is	
lowest	
during	
N3	
sleep	
,	
thus	
predisposing	
to	
aspiration	
.	

The	
UES	
contractile	
reflex	
remains	
intact	
during	
sleep	
,	
including	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Lower	
esophageal	
sphincter	
(	
LES	
)	
pressure	
remains	
unchanged	
during	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
increases	
the	
vagal	
threshold	
for	
trig-	
gering	
transient	
LES	
relaxations	
,	
so	
they	
usually	
do	
not	
occur	
during	
stable	
sleep	
and	
are	
usually	
confined	
to	
arousals	DISEASE
.	

When	
GER	DISEASE
events	
occur	
during	
sleep	
,	
esophageal	
refluxate	DISEASE
clearance	
is	
prolonged	
and	
an	
arousal	
is	
required	
.	

Sleep	
facilitates	
proxi-	
mal	
refluxate	DISEASE
migration	
toward	
the	
UES	
.	

Saliva	
secretion	
,	
with	
its	
acid	
-	
neutralizing	
bicarbonate	CHEMICAL
,	
ceases	
during	
sleep	
.	

Swallowing	
,	
required	
for	
esophageal	
peristalsis	
and	
refluxate	DISEASE
clearance	
,	
does	
not	
occur	
during	
sleep	
and	
is	
dependent	
on	
an	
arousal	
.	

Sleep	DISEASE
also	DISEASE
delays	DISEASE
gastric	DISEASE
emptying	DISEASE
by	
disrupting	
gastromyoelectric	
function	
.	

Events	
causing	
arousals	DISEASE
,	
including	
periodic	
limb	
movements	
and	
apneas	DISEASE
,	
could	
trigger	
transient	
LES	
relaxations	
and	
thus	
GER	DISEASE
events	
.	

Because	
refluxate	DISEASE
clearance	
requires	
an	
arousal	
,	
medications	
decreasing	
the	
arousal	
response	
(	
including	
benzodiazepines	CHEMICAL
and	
zolp-	
idem	
)	
may	
prolong	
refluxate	DISEASE
clearance	
and	
increase	
the	
risk	
of	
aspiration	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
pathology	
of	
GER	DISEASE
includes	
abnormal	
esophageal	
manometry	
,	
endoscopy	
,	
and	
esophageal	
biopsy	
findings	
.	

Esophageal	
manometry	
findings	
include	
an	
increased	
frequency	
of	
transient	
LES	
relaxations	
,	
altered	
or	
decreased	
esophageal	
peristaltic	
contraction	
amplitude	
,	
and	
a	
decrease	
in	
LES	
pressure	
.	

Endoscopic	
findings	
include	
changes	
ranging	
from	
mild	
erythema	DISEASE
,	
erosions	DISEASE
,	
and	
ulcerations	DISEASE
to	
severe	
erosions	DISEASE
with	
stricture	DISEASE
.	

Barrett	DISEASE
esophagus	DISEASE
is	
identified	
when	
columnar	
tissue	
replaces	
the	
normal	
squamous	
epithelium	
of	
the	
distal	
esophagus	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Diagnostic	
testing	
is	
not

The	
diagnosis	
can	
be	
made	
if	
typical	
symptoms	
of

and/or	
regurgitation	
are	
present	
during	
sleep

Esophageal	
monitoring	
is	
recommended	
in	
difficult	
,	
refractory	
cases	
,	
or	
when	
symptoms	
continue	
despite	
therapy

Sleep

GER	DISEASE
is	
more	
likely	
to	
occur	
during	
the	
first	
two	
hours	
of	
sleep	
time

Furthermore	
,	
in	
studies	
using	
combined	
esophageal	
pH	
monitoring	
with	
actigraphy	
,	
acid	
reflux	
events	
occurred	
primarily	
during	
the	
recumbent	
-	
awake	
period	
,	
versus	
the	
recumbent	
-

Reflux	
events	
are	
more	
likely

occur	
in	
the	
right	
side

supine	
positions	
than

arousals	DISEASE
that

often	
associated	
with	
swallows

a	
notable	
increase	
in	
chin

tone	
.	

Esophageal	
pH	
monitoring	
detects	
acid	
reflux	
events	
and	
can	
be	
integrated	
with	
PSG	
.	

Esophageal	
pH	
monitoring	
should	
be	
performed	
over

90

.	

The

cm	
above	
the	
LES	
.	

A	
proximal	
pH	
probe	
is	
often	
placed

An	
acid	
reflux	
event	
is	
defined	
when	
the	
pH	
drops	CHEMICAL
to	
less	
than	
4.0	
,	
and	
this	
variable	
is	
reported	
as

If	
esophageal	
pH

is	
integrated	
with	
polysomnography	
,	
esophageal	
acid

can	
be	
cor-	
related

including	
arousals	DISEASE
,	
apneas	DISEASE
,	
laryngospasm	DISEASE

and	
increased

.	

Esophageal	
pH	
monitoring	
also	
can	
be	
performed	
simultaneously	
with	
actigraphy	
to	
correlate	
acid	
reflux	
events	
with	
sleep

wake	
periods

Catheter-	DISEASE

pH	
systems	
are	
also	
available	
and	
are	
deployed	
into	
the	
esophagus	
,	
usually	
by	
endoscopy

Esophageal	
impedance

can	
be	
combined	
with	
pH	
probes	
detecting	
liquid

Use	
of	
esophageal

is	
often	
performed

with	
peptic	DISEASE
ulcer	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
and	
angina	DISEASE

The	
chest	DISEASE

with	
GER	DISEASE
is	
sometimes	
indistinguishable	
from	
that	
of

is	
commonly	
associated	
with	
a	
burning

sometimes	
be	
similar	
to	
the

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
myocardial	DISEASE
ischemia	DISEASE
is	
characterized	
by	
nocturnal	
reduction	
of	
blood	
flow	
to	
the	
myocardium	
,	
typically	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
symptoms	
of	
sleep	
related	
myo-	CHEMICAL
cardial	
ischemia	DISEASE
are	
very	
similar	
to	
those	
that	
characterize	
episodes	
of	
cardiac	
isch-	
emia	CHEMICAL
during	
the	
daytime	
.	

Classically	
,	
there	
is	
a	
feeling	
of	
chest	
pressure	
or	
pain	DISEASE
that	
awakens	
the	
patient	
from	
sleep	
and	
may	
be	
described	
as	
a	
“	
viselike	
”	
discomfort	
.	

The	
discomfort	
may	
radiate	
to	
the	
chin	
and	
jaw	
and	
to	
the	
arm	
,	
especially	
the	
left	
arm	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Acute	
episodes	
of	
sleep	
related	
myocardial	DISEASE
ischemia	DISEASE
sometimes	
elicit	
atrial	
or	
ventric-	
ular	
arrhythmias	DISEASE
.	

Other	
associated	
presentations	
include	
acute	
onset	
of	
shortness	DISEASE
of	DISEASE
breath	DISEASE
that	
wakes	
the	
patient	
from	
sleep	
and	
that	
may	
be	
secondary	
to	
left	
ventricular	
diastolic	
dysfunction	
or	
ischemic	
mitral	DISEASE
regurgitation	DISEASE
.	

Other	
related	
features	
depend	
on	
the	
trigger	
for	
the	
cardiac	DISEASE
ischemia	DISEASE
.	

Ischemic	
events	
related	
to	
OSA	DISEASE
may	
present	
during	
those	
times	
of	
sleep	
when	
nocturnal	
desaturation	DISEASE
is	
most	
severe	
.	

Cardiac	
isch-	
emia	CHEMICAL
related	
to	
hemodynamic	
changes	
or	
vasospasm	DISEASE
occurring	
during	
REM	
sleep	
may	
present	
in	
the	
early	
hours	
of	
the	
morning	
,	
around	
the	
time	
of	
waking	
,	
when	
REM	
sleep	
is	
most	
likely	
to	
occur	
.	

Ischemia	DISEASE

is	
most	
likely	
to	
occur	
during	
slow

Demographics	

The	
specifics

prevalence

sex	
ratios

and	
age	
ranges	
have	
not	
been	
comprehensively	
evaluated

Some	
insights	
into	
demographics	
can	
be	
extrapolated	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
cause	
of	
nocturnal	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
.	

For	
sleep	
related	
myocardial	DISEASE
ischemia	DISEASE
triggered	
by	
OSA	DISEASE
,	
the	
preponderance	
of	
OSA	DISEASE
in	
men	
suggests	
that	
middle	
-	
aged	
men	
with	
severe	
OSA	DISEASE
are	
more	
likely	
to	
experience	
nocturnal	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
,	
particularly	
if	
they	
have	
more	
severe	
coronary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
.	

Variant	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
(	
also	
referred	
to	
as	
vasospastic	DISEASE
or	
Prinzmetal	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
)	
more	
commonly	
affects	
younger	
populations	
,	
particularly	
women	
and	
those	
of	
Asian	
descent	
.	

Cardiac	DISEASE
ischemia	DISEASE
secondary	
to	
nocturnal	
hypotension	DISEASE
is	
more	
com-	
monly	
manifested	
in	
older	
individuals	
,	
particularly	
those	
with	
severe	
vasculopathy	DISEASE
who	
are	
taking	
multiple	
antihypertensive	
medications	
,	
and	
especially	
those	
in	
whom	
autonomic	DISEASE
dysfunction	DISEASE
(	
related	
to	
either	
age	
or	
diabetes	DISEASE
)	
may	
impair	
blood

homeostatic	
mechanisms	
.	

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Predisposing	
factors	
include	
established	
coronary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
or	
valvular	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
such	
as	
aortic	DISEASE
stenosis	DISEASE
.	

Because	
coronary	
filling	
occurs	
during	
diastole	
,	
conditions	
associated	
with	
reduced	
diastolic	
blood	
pressure	
,	
such	
as	
severe	
aortic	
regurgita-	
tion	
,	
may	
elicit	
nocturnal	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
,	
particularly	
in	
the	
presence	
of	
preexisting	
coro-	

nary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
.	

Similarly	
,	
any	
predisposition	
to	
hypotension	DISEASE
,	
which	
is	
most	
likely	
to	
occur	
during	
slow	
wave	
(	
N3	
)	
sleep	
,	
may	
heighten	
risk	
.	

Usual	
risk	
factors	
for	
coronary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
that	
predispose	
an	
individual	
to	
the	
development	
of	
sleep	
related	
myocardial	DISEASE
ischemia	DISEASE
include	
hypertension	DISEASE
,	
diabetes	DISEASE
mellitus	DISEASE
,	
cigarette	
smoking	
,	
and	
hyperlipidemia	DISEASE
.	

Retrospective	
and	
prospective	
studies	
suggest	
that	
OSA	DISEASE
may	
be	
a	
trigger	
for	
myo-	CHEMICAL
cardial	DISEASE
infarction	DISEASE
and	
sudden	
death	DISEASE
that	
occurs	
at	
night	
.	

Deeper	
oxyhemoglobin	
desaturations	DISEASE
,	
which	
may	
be	
encountered	
in	
REM	
,	
particularly	
with	
coexisting	
pulmonary	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
or	
truncal	DISEASE
-	DISEASE
abdominal	DISEASE
obesity	DISEASE
,	
are	
more	
likely	
to	
trigger	
cardiac	DISEASE
ischemia	DISEASE
.	

In	
patients	
with	
vasospastic	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
,	
use	
of	
nonselective	
β	
-	
adrenergic	
receptor	
-	
blocking	
agents	
may	
theoretically	
increase	
the	
likelihood	
of	
vasospasm	DISEASE
.	

In	
patients	
with	
nocturnal	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
secondary	
to	
hypotension	DISEASE
,	
an	
excess	
of	
antihy-	
pertensive	
medications	
,	
as	
well	
as	
long	
-	
acting	
nitroglycerin	CHEMICAL
administered	
prior	
to

,	
may	
contribute	
.	

Finally	
,	
in	
the

context	
,	
abuse	
of	
drugs	
such	
as	
amphetamine	CHEMICAL
,

the

occur	
only	
when	
the	
severity	
of	
both	
the

result	
in

.	

A	
substrate	
of	
preexisting	
severe	
coronary	DISEASE
artery	DISEASE
disease	DISEASE
is	
expected	
to	
exacerbate	
this	
problem	
.	

Variant	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
may	
be	
more	
likely	
to	
occur	
during	
sleep	
because	
of	
the	
significant	
and	
abrupt	
fluctuations	
in	
cardiovascular	
neural	
control	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

For	
nocturnal	DISEASE
angina	DISEASE
related	
to	
hypotension	DISEASE
,	
perfu-	
sion	
of	
the	
coronary	
arteries	
during	
diastole	
makes	
maintenance	
of

during

important	
for

Objective	
Findings	
Electrocardiographic	
monitoring	
during	
sleep	
reveals	
horizontal	
or	
downsloping	
ST	
segment	
depression	DISEASE
of	
greater	
than	
or	
equal	
to	
1	
mm	
,	
or	
ST	
segment	
elevation	
of	
1	
mm	
or	
more	
.	

The	
electrocardiographic	
evidence	
of	
sleep	
related	
coronary	
artery	DISEASE
ischemia	DISEASE
is	
sometimes	
unaccompanied	
by	
chest	
discomfort	
or	
other	
symptoms	
(	
silent	
ischemia	DISEASE
)	
and	
may	
be	
incidentally	
noted	
on	
either	
Holter	
monitoring	
or	
telemetry	
.	

In	
general	
,	
ST	
segment	
abnormalities	
indicative	
of	
myocardial	DISEASE
ischemia	DISEASE
are	
1	
mm	
or	
more	
horizontal	
or	
down	
-	
sloping	
depression	DISEASE
or	
ST	
segment	
elevation	
,	
which	
may	
be	
detected	
on	
the	
single	
lead	
electrocardiogram	
(	
ECG	
)	
employed	
in	
most	
sleep	
labo-	
ratories	
.	

However	
,	
because	
the	
sensitivity	
of	
single	
-	
lead	
ECG	
in	
detecting	
ischemic	
changes	
is	
poor	
,	
the	
patient	
with	
symptoms	
compatible	
with	
angina	DISEASE
with	
a	
normal	
-	
ap-	
pearing	
single	
ECG	
channel	
should	
be	
further	
evaluated	
with	
multichannel	
ECG	
.

Slow

The

prompt	
an	
evaluation	
for

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Sleep

must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
gastroesophageal	DISEASE
reflux	DISEASE
,	
which	
may	
also	
be	
associated	
with	
chest

.	

The	
nature	
of	
the	
pain	DISEASE
,	
associated	
symptoms	
and	
prior	
history	
are	
helpful	
in	
making	
a	
distinction	
,	
although	
12

lead	
ECG	
may	
be	
necessary	
in	
some	
cases

may	
be	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
chest	DISEASE
wall	DISEASE
pain	DISEASE
and	
respiratory	DISEASE
distress	DISEASE

Although	
the

of	
patients	
with	
nocturnal	DISEASE

will	
have	
a	
history	
of	
daytime	DISEASE
panic	DISEASE

,	
a	
small	
percentage	
have	
only	
nocturnal

Nocturnal	DISEASE
panic	DISEASE

may	
be	
confused	
with	
myocardial	DISEASE
ischemic	DISEASE
episodes	DISEASE

although	
typical	
anginal

pleuritic	DISEASE

be	
considered	
in	
the

Chest	DISEASE

be	
sec-	CHEMICAL
ondary	
to	
a	
variety	
of	
causes
