Finally	
,	
by	
identifying	
areas	
of	
uncertainty	
and	
overlap	
among	
related	
patholo-	
gies	
,	
these	
systems	
play	
a	
critical	
role	
in	
guiding	
future	
research	
agendas	
which	
will	
enhance	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
clinical	
features	
,	
pathophysiology	
and	
treatment	
response	
specific	
to	
each	
disorder	
.	

Since	
its	
infancy	
35	
years	
ago	
,	
the	
field	
of	
sleep	
medicine	
has	
paid	
particular	
atten-	
tion	
to	
the	
issue	
of	
classification	CONCEPT
,	
beginning	
with	
the	
1979	
American	
Sleep	
Disorders	
Association	
’s	
Diagnostic	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
and	DOCUMENT
Arousal	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
.	

Since	
that	
time	
,	
as	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
sleep	
disorders	
has	
grown	
,	
several	
differ-	
ent	
structural	
approaches	
have	
been	
utilized	
in	
revisions	
of	
the	
classification	CONCEPT
system	CONCEPT
,	
culminating	
in	
the	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
,	DOCUMENT
2nd	DOCUMENT
Edition	DOCUMENT
.	

The	
organization	
of	
that	
edition	
,	
although	
not	
without	
its	
limitations	
,	
has	
proven	
effective	
and	
user	
-	
friendly	
and	
has	
been	
maintained	
in	
the	
current	
revision	
.	

Ideally	
,	
classification	CONCEPT
systems	CONCEPT
are	
based	
largely	
on	
pathophysiology	
.	

However	
,	
such	
an	
approach	
is	
dependent	
on	
adequate	
knowledge	
concerning	
the	
various	
pathophysiol-	
ogies	
of	
disease	
or	
disorder	
within	
a	
given	
discipline	
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
with	
many	
diag-	
nostic	
systems	
,	
our	
current	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
many	
sleep	
disorders	
is	
inadequate	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
International	DOCUMENT

3rd	DOCUMENT
Edition	DOCUMENT
Despite	
these	
shortcomings	
,	
this	
approach	
is	
one	
that	
has	
proven	
familiar	
and	
workable	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
clinicians	
.	

Recognizing	
the	
need	
for	
currency	
and	
relevance	
in	
a	
rapidly	
evolving	
field	
,	
the	
American	
Academy	
of	
Sleep	
Medicine	
Board	
of	
Directors	
approved	
a	
revision	
of	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
,	DOCUMENT
2nd	DOCUMENT
Edition	DOCUMENT
These	
reviews	
were	
carefully	
considered	
and	
revi-	
sions	
made	
based	
on	
this	
input	
.	

Subsequent	
to	
this	
,	
text	
revisions	
were	
begun	
and	
the	
same	
review	
process	
and	
modifications	
were	
undertaken	
once	
text	
drafts	
were	
com-	
pleted	
.	

Further	
modifications	
were	
made	
based	
on	
recommendations	
from	
the	
AASM	DOCUMENT
board	DOCUMENT
before	
finalization	
of	
the	
edition	
.	

At	
all	
points	
in	
this	
process	
,	
efforts	
were	
made	
to	
rely	
as	
heavily	
as	
possible	
on	
available	
and	
current	
scientific	
evidence	
.	

However	
,	
due	
to	
the	
paucity	
of	
available	
evidence	
in	
many	
areas	
,	
decisions	
regarding	
the	
nosol-	
ogy	
were	
often	
made	
by	
consensus	
of	
the	
work	
groups	
,	
task	
force	
,	
and	
reviewers	
.	

Using	
ICSD-3	DOCUMENT
As	
noted	
above	
,	
the	
general	
structure	
of	
the	
current	
edition	
closely	
parallels	
that	
of	
the	
second	
edition	
.	

The	
major	
clinical	
divisions	
remain	
unchanged	
.	

As	
with	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
,	
2nd	
Edition	
,	
pediatric	TEST
diagnoses	TEST
are	
fully	
integrated	
into	
the	
major	
clinical	TEST
diagnoses	TEST
,	
with	
the	
exception	
of	
obstructive	CONDITION
sleep	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
Where	
pediatric	
presentations	
call	
for	
variation	
in	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
,	
those	
variations	
are	
noted	
within	
the	
criteria	
section	
.	

In	
an	
effort	
to	
better	
identify	
those	
clinical	
features	
of	
a	
disorder	
which	
are	
developmentally	
-	
specific	
,	
a	
text	
heading	
for	
Developmental	
Issues	
has	
been	
added	
for	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

Specific	
ICD	DOCUMENT
codes	
(	
9	DOCUMENT
-	DOCUMENT
CM	DOCUMENT
and	
10	DOCUMENT
-	DOCUMENT
CM	DOCUMENT
)	DOCUMENT
are	
listed	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

Because	
of	
the	
complexities	
and	
differences	
between	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
diagnoses	
and	
the	
ICD	DOCUMENT
system	
,	
assign-	
ment	
of	
codes	
is	
challenging	
.	

These	
issues	
are	
discussed	
further	
under	
Coding	
below	
.	

Although	
classification	
systems	
are	
,	
by	
their	
nature	
,	
intended	
to	
define	
disorders	
in	
the	
most	
specific	
terms	
possible	
,	
clinicians	
must	
recognize	
that	
there	
is	
inevitably	
some	
degree	
of	
variability	
in	
presentation	
which	
may	
result	
in	
clinically	CONDITION
significant	CONDITION
conditions	CONDITION
Clinicians	
should	
note	
that	
most	
diagnoses	
within	
the	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
include	
a	
criterion	CONCEPT
,	CONCEPT
or	
cri-	
teria	
,	
that

i.e.

significant	
conse-	
quences	
,	
distress	
or	
impairment	RISKFACTOR
in	
one	
or	
more	
functional	
realms	
)	
.	

These	
criteria	CONCEPT
are	
particularly	
important	
because	
,	
without	
them	
,	
many	
phenomena	
related	
to	
sleep	
-

do	
not	
rise	
to	
a

also	
pay

attention	
to	
the

as	
these

Clinicians	
will	
note	
a	
number	
of	
significant	
content	
changes	
from	
the	
former	
edition	
.	

The	
most	
apparent	
of	
these	
is	
the	
collapse

Relationship

Other	
Classification	
Systems	
Historically	
,	
there	
have	
been	
three	
major	
classifications	
systems	
for	
sleep	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
.	

Although	
the	
International	CONCEPT
Classification	CONCEPT
of	CONCEPT
Sleep	CONCEPT
Disorders	CONCEPT
system	
has	
,	
for	
many	
years	
,	
been	
the	
primary	
nosology	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
specialists	
,	
both	
the	
Diagnostic	DOCUMENT
and	DOCUMENT
Statistical	DOCUMENT
Manual	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Mental	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
(	
DSM	DOCUMENT
)	
of	
the	
American	
Psychiatric	
Association	
and	
the	
International	CONCEPT
Classification	CONCEPT
of	CONCEPT
Diseases	CONCEPT
(	
ICD	
)	
nosology	
of	
the	
World	
Health	
Organization	
have	
also	
classified	
sleep	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
.	

Unfortunately	
,	
these	
competing	
systems	
have	
differed	
significantly	
in	
structure	
and	
content	
over	
the	
years	
.	

Development	
of	
DSM-5	DOCUMENT
was	
ongoing	
during	
the	
development	
of	
this	
manual	
and	
an	
effort	
was	
undertaken	
to	
achieve	
the	
greatest	
degree	
of	
concordance	
possible	
between	
these	
two	
systems	
,	
recognizing	
that	
the	
International	CONCEPT
Classification	CONCEPT
of	CONCEPT
Sleep	CONCEPT
Disorders	CONCEPT
will	
inevitably	
contain	
a	
greater	
level	
of	
detail	
than	
DSM	DOCUMENT
This	
goal	
was	
largely	
achieved	
although	
some	
differences	
will	
still	
exist	
.	

The	
major	
change	
to	
the	
Insomnia	SYMPTOM
section	
(	
i.e.	
establishment	
of	
a	
single	
chronic	CONDITION
insomnia	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
diagnosis	
)	
within	
this	
new	
system	
is	
paralleled	
in	
DSM-5	DOCUMENT

Central	CONDITION

diagnoses	
are	
organized	
somewhat	
differently	
in	
the	
DSM	
clas-	
sification	
than	
in	
this	
manual	
and	
narcolepsy	
criteria	
differ	
slightly	
.	

	
Circadian	CONDITION
Rhythm	CONDITION
Sleep	CONDITION

Wake	CONDITION
Disorder	CONDITION
diagnoses	
are	
identical	
within	
the	
two	
systems	
with	
the	
exception	
that	
DSM	
does	
not	
include	
a	
jet	CONDITION

Sleep	CONDITION

Disorders	CONDITION
are	
significantly	
more	
detailed	
within	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
than	
DSM-5	DOCUMENT
,	
although	
the	
organizational	
structures	
in	
this	
section	
are	
quite	
similar	
.	

	
Sleep	CONDITION

Movement	CONDITION
Disorders	CONDITION
and	
Parasomnias	CONDITION
are	
likewise	
similar	
but	
with	
fewer	
overall	
diagnoses	
within

With

a	
major

to	
expand

reorganize	
sleep

within

was	
undertaken

Moreover

Among

,	
sleep	SYMPTOM
complaints	SYMPTOM
most	
typically	
include	
difficulties	
initiating

Concerns	
about	
lengthy	
periods

nocturnal	
wakefulness	
,	
insufficient	
amounts	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep

or	
poor

the

nature

a	
frequent	
and	
persistent	
difficulty

maintaining	
sleep	
that	
results	
in	
general	
sleep

The

Complaints	
of	
early	
morning

typically	
entail	
the	
termination	
of	
sleep

and	
a	
concomitant

the	
usual	
premorbid	
sleep	
pattern

The

early

awakenings	
occur	
may	
vary	
con-	
siderably

For	
example	
,	
a	
final	
awakening

4:00

is	
likely	
to	
connote	
clinical	
significance	
when

11:00	
p.m.	

but	
not	
when	
the	
usual	
bedtime

Insomnia

Many

As	
a

discrimination

has	
proven	
difficult	
given	
their	
current

the

In	
such

there	
is

it

Given

a

it

Because

However	
,	
when	
sleep	
difficulties	
are	
persistent

pronounced	
in

,	
underlying	
medical	
causes	
should	
be	
considered	
(

as	
precipitating

per-

factors

may	
vary	
across	
the	
adult	
age	
range	
.	

These	
changes	
may	
in	
part	
reflect	
developmental	
changes	
across	
adulthood	
,	
such	
as	
the	
phase	
delay	
of	
endoge-

circadian	
rhythms	
in

the

increased	
number

often	
seen	
even	
among	
healthy	
older	
adults

Epidemiological	
studies	
confirm	
that	
sleep

nonrestorative

are	
most

Likewise	
,	
perpetuating	
factors	
may	
vary	
with	
the	
life	
circumstances	
of	
adults	
of	
different	
ages

One	
common	
example	
is	
the	
option	
of	
older	
adults	
to	
spend	
large	
amounts	
of	
time	
in

have	
focused

These

Although	
various

identified	
subgroups	
who	
are	
presumed	
to	
have	
an	
insomnia

present	
solely	
with	
a	
complaint	
that	
their

non-

The

is	
the

Essential	
Features	
The	
essential	
feature

term	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
a	
short	
-	
term	
difficulty	
ini-	
tiating	
or	
maintaining	
sleep	
that	
results	
in	
general	
sleep	
dissatisfaction

The	
sleep	SYMPTOM
complaint	SYMPTOM
is	
accompanied	
by	
daytime	SYMPTOM
distress	SYMPTOM
about	SYMPTOM
poor	SYMPTOM

or	
impairment	
in	
family	
,	
social	
,	
occupational	
,

of	
functioning

Furthermore	
,	
the	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
and	
associated	
daytime	SYMPTOM
symptoms	SYMPTOM
occur	
despite	
having	
adequate	
time	
and	
circumstances	
each	
night	
to	
obtain	
necessary	
sleep	
.	

Short-

In	
many

less	
than	
three	
months	
,	
there	
is	
an	
identifiable	
cause

serves	
as	
the	
precipitant	
.	

In	
other	
cases	
,	
insomnia	
occurs	
episodically	
,	
often	
coincident	
to	
daytime	
stressors	CONCEPT
As	
is	
the	
case	
for	
chronic	CONDITION
insomnia	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
,	
sleep	
complaints	
that	
compose	
short-	CONDITION
term	CONDITION
insomnia	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
may	
include	
difficulties	
initiating	
sleep	
or	
difficulties	
main-

The	
latter	
complaint	
may	
include	
waking	
up	
during	
the

by	
both

Isolated	SYMPTOM
Symptoms	SYMPTOM
and	
Normal	
Variants	
Excessive	
Time	
in	
Bed	

Some	
individuals	
may	
present	
with	
isolated	
insomnia	SYMPTOM
symptoms	SYMPTOM
such	
as	
prolonged	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
latencies	SYMPTOM
or	
long	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
during	
the	
night	
,	
yet	
not	
complain	
of	
insomnia	CONDITION
nor	
show	
daytime	
impairments	
.	

In	
children	
,	
this	
pattern	
may	
emerge	
when	
parents	
or	
caregivers	
have	
unrealistic	
expectations	
for	
the	
child	
’s	
sleep	
needs	
and	
rou-	
tinely	
allot	
too	
much	
time	
for	
the	
child	
to	
be	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
this	
pattern	
is	
perhaps	
most	
common	
in	
noncomplaining	
groups	
who	
routinely	
allot	
significantly	
more	
time	
in	
bed	
than	
needed	
for	
sleep	
.	

For	
example	
,	
some	
individuals	
who	
are	
retired	
from	
work	
or	
not	
currently	
employed	
may	
routinely	
spend	
excessive	
time	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
and	
are	
not	
bothered	
by	
the	
expanded	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
they	
routinely	
experience	
.	

At	
present	
,	
epidemiological	
and	
laboratory	
studies	
are	
unable	
to	
ascertain	
whether	
adverse	
health	
outcomes	
are	
more	
strongly	
associated	
with	
perceived	
sleep	
difficulties	
/	
dissatisfaction	
or	
with	
particular	
objective	
indices	
of	
sleep	
duration	
,	
sleep	
latency	
,	
and	
sleep	
continuity	
.	

	
Short	CONDITION
Sleeper	CONDITION
Such	
individuals	
are	
considered	
to	
be	
normal	
short	SYMPTOM
sleepers	SYMPTOM
if	
they	
have	
no	
complaints	
of	
sleep	
difficulties	
and	
show	
no	
obvious	
daytime	SYMPTOM
dysfunction	SYMPTOM
.	

Among	
these	
individuals	
,	
the	
observed	
relatively	
low	
average	
sleep	
time	
does	
not	
result	
from	
chronic	
volitional	
sleep	
restriction	
,	
as	
in	
the	
case	
of	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
,	
but	
rather	
indicates	
a	
constitutional	
disposition	
for	
reduced	
sleep	
requirement	
.	

The	
clinical	
significance	
of	
chronic	
short	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
duration	SYMPTOM
,	
and	
the	
identifi-	
cation	
of	
possible	
subtypes	CONCEPT
,	
remain	
open	
questions	
.	

Various	
studies	
have	
linked	
short	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
duration	SYMPTOM
with	
metabolic	
,	
cardiovascular	
,	
and	
other	
forms	
of	
medical	
morbidity	
.	

However	
,	
these	
studies	
are	
typically	
unable	
to	
distinguish	
between	
individuals	
who	
have	
short	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
in	
the	
context	
of	
insomnia	CONDITION
or	
another	
sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
,	
those	
who	
are	
voluntarily	
restricting	
their	
sleep	
,	
and	
those	
who	
may	
have	
naturally	
short	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
.	

	
Short	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
resulting	
from	
different	
causes	
may	
have	
different	
pathophysiological	
signifi-	
cance	
.	

At	
present	
,	
those	
who	
demonstrate	
less	
than	
six	
hours	
of	
sleep	
per	
night	
should	
not	
be	
assigned	
an

diagnosis	
unless	
they

Depending

the

When

Current

Demographics

Nevertheless	
,	
general	
population

studies	
from	
a	
number

indicate	
that

However	
,	
because

not

,	
the	
prevalence	
of	
the

The

This

Developmental	
Issues	
OSA	CONDITION
can	
occur	
in	
any	
age	
group	
,	
but	
in	
adults	
,	
prevalence	
accelerates	
between	
young	
adulthood	
and	
middle	
age	
,	
with	
a	
plateau	
reached	
after	
approximately	
age	
65	
years	
.	

Although	
OSA	CONDITION
occurs	
in	
the	
elderly	
,	
it	
is	
commonly	
observed	
with	
few	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
.	

In	
addition	
,	
some	
evidence	
suggests	
that	
risk

related	
to	
OSA	CONDITION
Pediatric	
OSA	CONDITION
is	
discussed	
in	
a	
separate	
section	
(	
below	
)	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
underlying	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
during	
sleep	
is	
multifactorial	
.	

Patients	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
commonly	
have	
reduced	
cross	
-	
sectional	
area	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
lumen	
due	
to	
either	
excessive	
bulk	
of	
soft	
tissues	
(	
tongue	
,	
soft	
palate	
,	
and	
lateral	
pha-	
ryngeal	
walls	
)	
or	
craniofacial	
anatomy	
,	
or	
both	
.	

During	
inspiration	
,	
negative	
pressure	
is	
generated	
in	
the	
lumen	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
,	
promoting	
closure	
.	

However	
,	
pharyngeal	
dilating	
muscles	
act	
to	
maintain	
patency	
.	

The	
activity	
of	
these	
muscles	
decreases	
with	
sleep	
onset	
,	
but	
is	
normally	
adequate	
to	
maintain	
an	
open	
airway	
.	

In	
persons	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
There	
is	
a	
further	
reduction	
in	
tone	
and	
phasic	
activity	
of	
pharyngeal	
dilating	
muscles	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
particularly	
in	
phasic	
REM	
,	
which	
likely	
contributes	
to	
apneas	CONDITION
and	
hypopneas	SYMPTOM
that	
are	
longer	
and	
more	
pronounced	
.

Smaller	
end

result	
in	
smaller	
upper	
airway	
size	
due	
to	
decreased	
downward	TEST
traction	TEST
(	
tracheal	
tug	
)	
.	

Some	
patients	
have	
unstable	
ventilatory	
control	
(	
high	
loop	
gain	
)	
with	
resulting	
periods	
of	
hypocapnia	SYMPTOM
that	
may	
also	
contribute	
to	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
.	

The	
mechanisms	
of	
apnea	CONDITION
/	
hypopnea	CONDITION
Some	
events	
may	
resolve	
with	
aug-	
mentation	
of	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
from	
chemical	
(	
low	
PaO2	TEST
,	
high	
PaCO2	TEST
)	
and	
mechanical	
(	
upper	
airway	
mechanoreceptors	
)	
stimuli	
,	
whereas	
others	
may	
depend	
on	
a	
change	
of	
sleep	
state	
(	
arousal	
)	
at	
either	
a	
cortical	
or	
subcortical	
level	
.	

Cortical	
arous-	
als	
are	
associated	
with	
changes	
detectable	
by	
EEG	TEST
,	
whereas	
other	
changes	
of	
state	
may	
be	
detectable	
only	
by	
direct	
or	
indirect	
measures	
of	
sympathetic	
tone	
.	

Even	
if	
arousals	
are	
not	
required	
for	
termination	
of	
all	
obstructive	
events	
,	
sleep	
fragmentation	
from	
arousals	
is	
nevertheless	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
significant	
cause	
of	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

Apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
typically	
last	
considerably	
longer	
in	
REM	
and	
,	
in	
some	
patients	
,	
are	
only	
present	
in	
this	
sleep	
stage	
.	

The	
explanation	
for	
this	
finding	
is	
unknown	
.	

As	
an	
apnea	
or	
hypopnea	
event	
progresses	
,	
the	
patient	
gradually	
becomes	
more	
hypox-	
emic	
;	
the	
degree	
of	
oxygen	
desaturation	
is	
dependent	
not	
only	
on	
the	
duration	
of	
the	
event	
,	
but	
also	
on	
the	
patient	
’s	
baseline	
oxygen	
saturation	
and	
lung	
volume	
and	
the	
presence	
of	
comorbid	
lung	CONDITION
conditions	CONDITION
.	

Slight	
hypercarbia	SYMPTOM
also	
occurs	
during	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
and	
is	
worse	
during	
REM	
sleep

Objective	
Findings	
Obstructive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
are	
documented	
by	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
with	
ongoing	
respiratory	
efforts	
during	
PSG	TEST
or	
an	
OCST	TEST
.	TEST

When	
breathing	
effort	
is	
recorded	
with	
respiratory	TEST
inductance	TEST
plethysmography	TEST
,	TEST
it	
typically	
shows	
paradoxical	
movement	
of	
the	
rib	
cage	
and	
abdomen	
.	

If	
esophageal	TEST
manometry	TEST
is	
used	
,	
increasingly	
large	
swings	
between	
inspiratory	
and	
expiratory	
efforts	
are	
observed	
.	

	
Obstructive	CONDITION
hypopneas	CONDITION
are	
a	
reduction	
rather	
than	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
with	
ongoing	
respiratory	
effort	
.	

Increasing	
respira-	
tory	
effort	
with	
constant	
or	
reduced	
flow	
is	
indicative	
of	
increased	
upper	
airway	
resis-	
tance	
.	

This	
state	
is	
most	
accurately	
identified	
with	
a	
quantitative	
measurement	
of	
flow	
and	
esophageal	TEST
manometry	TEST
,	
although	
it	
can	
be	
inferred	
when	
there	
is	
obvious	
inspira-	
tory	
airflow	
limitation	
(	
flattening	
of	
the	
inspiratory	
flow	
)	
on	
a	
nasal	
pressure	
recording	
.	

Although	
patients	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
have	
predominantly	
obstructive	
events	
,	
they	
may	
also	
have	
variable	
amounts	
of	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
.	CONDITION
In	
some	
patients	
,	
these	
resolve	
with	
admin-	
istration	
of	
positive	TREATMENT
airway	TREATMENT
pressure	TREATMENT
,	
whereas	
in	
others	
frequent	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
either	
persist	
or	
emerge	
,	
at	
least	
during	
the	
initial	
night	
of	
positive	TREATMENT
airway	TREATMENT
pressure	TREATMENT
treatment	
.	

Oxygen	
saturation	
typically	
declines	
for	
a	
variable	
period	
of	
time	
following	
the	
onset	
of	
an	
event	
(	
apnea	CONDITION
or	
hypopnea	CONDITION
)	
,	
with	
the	
nadir	
usually	
occurring	
after	
normal	
breath-	
ing	
resumes	
.	

The	
degree	
of	
oxygen	
desaturation	
may	
range	
from	
as	
little	
as	
1	
%	
to	
2	
%	
,	
up	
to	
30	
%	
to	
40	
%	
or	
greater	
.	

If	
the	
baseline	
oxygen	
saturation	
is	
normal	
,	
there	
may	
be	
no	
discernible	
drop	
in	
oxygen	
saturation	
despite	
evidence	
of	
airflow	
limitation	
fol-	
lowed	
by	
arousal	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
some	
events	
associated	
with	
evidence	
of	
increased	
respi-	
ratory	
effort	
(	
and/or	
flattening	
of	
inspiratory	
flow	
)	
and	
an	
arousal	
at	
event	
termination	
may	
not	
meet	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
apnea	CONDITION
or	
hypopnea	CONDITION
.	

These	
events	
are	
defined	
as	
RERAs	CONCEPT

These

are	
presumed	
to	
have	
the	
same	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
as	
obstructive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
and	
hypopneas	CONDITION
(	
upper	CONDITION
airway	CONDITION

however	
,	
the

varies	
widely

At	
the

Differential	
Diagnosis	

In	
contrast	
to	
patients

,	
those	
with

snoring	CONDITION
will	
not	
exhibit	
obstruc-	CONDITION
tive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION

OCST	TEST
and	
do	
not	
have	
other	
sleep	
symp-	
toms	
attributable	
to	
breathing	
disturbance	
.	

However	
,	
because	
arousal	
-	
based	
hypopneas	CONDITION
and	
RERAs	CONDITION
can	
not	
be	
identified	
with	
OCST	TEST
,	
OSA	CONDITION
can	
not	
be	
excluded	
if	
the	
OCST	TEST
is	
negative	
.	

Patients	
with	
central	CONDITION
sleep	CONDITION

have	
predominantly	
central	
rather	
than	
obstruc-	CONDITION

apneas	CONDITION
,	
hypopneas	CONDITION
,	
or	
RERAs	CONDITION
as	
the	
primary	
finding	
on	
PSG	TEST

OCST	TEST
.	

If

apneas	CONDITION
are	
predominant	
,	
a

Snoring	SYMPTOM
may	
not	
be	
a	
prominent	
feature	
,	
although	
daytime	
sleepiness	
can	
occur	
.	

Patients

episodes

without	
evidence

obstruction	CONDITION
on	
PSG	TEST
or	
OCST	TEST
.	

Confirmation	
of	
nocturnal	
hypercapnia	
will	
be	
diagnostic	
.	

However	
,	
if	
obstructive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
or	
hypo-	CONDITION
pneas	CONDITION
are	
evident	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	CONDITION
should	
be	
made	
instead	
of

or	
in	
addition	
to	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
hypoventilation	CONDITION

OSA	CONDITION
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
sleepiness	
such	
as	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
,	
idio-	CONDITION
pathic	CONDITION
hypersomnia	CONDITION
,	
and	
insufficient	
sleep	
.	

These	
conditions	
often	
can	
be	
identified	
on	
the	
basis	
of	
history	
,	
but	
PSG	TEST
and/or	
MSLT	TEST
may	
be	
required	
to	
confirm	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

	
OSA	CONDITION
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
causes

such	
as	
noc-	CONDITION
turnal	CONDITION
panic	CONDITION

,	
paroxysmal	CONDITION
nocturnal	CONDITION
dyspnea	CONDITION
from

In	
many	
cases	
,	
absence	
of	
snoring	SYMPTOM
and	
daytime	SYMPTOM
sleepiness	SYMPTOM
will	
be	
highly	
suggestive	
of	
etiologies	
other	
than

However	
,	
the	
absence	
of	
obstructive	CONDITION

or	
RERAs	CONDITION
on	
PSG	TEST
will	
definitively

Pathophysiology	
In	
children	
,	
as	
in	
adults	
,	
OSA	CONDITION
During	
wakefulness	
,	
the	
patient	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
compensates	
by	
augmenting	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
to	
dilate	
the	
upper	
airway	
;	
thus	
,	
obstructive	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
does	
not	
occur	
.	

During	
sleep	
,	
there	
is	
a	
decrease	
in	
ventilatory	
drive	
and	
in	
neuromuscular	
tone	
,	
facilitating	
upper	
airway	
collapse	
.	

The	
resultant	
recurrent	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
,	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM

Childhood	
OSA	CONDITION
has	
also	
been	
associated	
with

and	
inflammatory	
abnormalities	
.	

In	
most	
children	
who	
are	
otherwise	
healthy	
,	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
is	
primarily	
due	
to	
adenotonsillar	CONDITION

Pediatric	
OSA	CONDITION
also	
occurs	
in

the	
condition	
is	
extremely	
rare	
in	
this	
age	
group	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
one	
study	
of	
patients	
with	
congestive	CONDITION
heart	CONDITION
failure	CONDITION
across	
all	
age	
groups	
found	
CSB	CONDITION
to	
be	
absent	
in	
children	
but	
present	
in	
40	
%	
of	
the	
adult	
patients	
with	
congestive	CONDITION
heart	CONDITION
failure	CONDITION
.	CONDITION
A	
limitation	
of	
the	
study	
was	
that	
only	
ten	
children	
with	
congestive	CONDITION
heart	CONDITION
failure	CONDITION
were	
studied	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
CSA	CONDITION
with	
CSB	CONDITION
generally	
arises	
because	
of	
instability	
in	
the	
respiratory	
control	
system	
.	

A	
high	
ventilatory	
drive	
and	
delay	
in	
chemoreceptor	
response	
to	
changes	
of	
PaCO2	TEST
and	
PaO2	TEST
(	
due	
to	
increased	
circulation	
time	
)	
are	
likely	
the	
major	
factors	
.	

This	
breathing	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
tends	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
chronically	
low	
PaCO2	TEST
when	
awake	
and	
asleep	
.	

	
Hyperventilation	SYMPTOM
occurs	
due	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
responsiveness	
of	
the	
periph-	
eral	
and	
central	
chemoreceptors	
.	

The	
increased	
responsiveness	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
to	
both	
increased	
sympathetic	
tone	
and	
stimulation	
of	
vagal	
irritant	
receptors	
in	
the	
lungs	
by	
pulmonary	
congestion	
.	

The	
PaCO2	TEST
in	
individuals	
with	
CSB	CONDITION
pattern	
and	
heart	CONDITION
failure	CONDITION
is	
closer	
to	
their	
apneic	
threshold	
than	
in	
those	
without	
CSB	CONDITION
pattern	
(	
primarily	
due	
to	
a	
smaller	
sleep	
related	
rise	
in	
PaCO2	TEST
in	
those	
with	
CSB	CONDITION
)	
,	
so	
that	
even	
modest	
increases	
in	
ventilation	
can	
drive	
PaCO2	TEST
below	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

The	
most	
common	
trigger	
factor	
for	
central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
is	
an	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
,	
which	
abruptly	
augments	
ventilation	
and	
drives	
PaCO2	TEST
The	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
tidal	TEST
volume	TEST
results	
from	
prolonged	
lung	
-	
to	
-	
che-	
moreceptor	
circulatory	
delay	
,	
such	
that	
changes	
in	
PaCO2	TEST
in	
the	
lung	
are	
trans-	
mitted	
only	
very	
slowly	
to	
the	
chemoreceptors	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
gradual	
buildup	
and	
falloff	
of	
ventilatory	TREATMENT
stimulation	TREATMENT
.	TREATMENT

The	
length	
of	
the	
cycle	
is	
directly	
proportional	
to	
lung	
-	
to	
-	
chemoreceptor	
circulation	
time	
and	
inversely	
proportional	
to	
cardiac	
output	
.	

Accordingly	
,	
whereas	
the	
length	
of	
the	
ventilatory	
-	
apneic	
cycle	
in	
primary	
CSA	
is	
typically	
shorter	
than	
40	
seconds	
,	
in	
CSB	
pattern	
it	
is	
almost	
invariably	
longer	
than	
40	
seconds	
(	
usually	
45	
-	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

One	
study	
of	
patients	
with	
varying	
degrees	
of	
heart	CONDITION
failure	CONDITION
found	
a	
considerably	
shorter	
cycle	
time	
in	
patients	
with	
normal	
ejection	
frac-	
tion	
(	
e.g.

The

the	
setting

However	
,	
apneas	CONDITION

CSB	CONDITION
Central	
hypopnea	
,	
rather

can	
occur	
at	
the

in	
a	
sub-	
stantial	
number

Central

the

The	
only

factor	
for	
the	
development

is	
increased	
ventilatory	TEST
chemoresponsiveness	TEST
,	
primarily	
hypoxic	
ventila-	
tory	
responsiveness

A	
high	
hypoxic

response	
will	
lead	
to	
increased	
hyper-	SYMPTOM
ventilation	SYMPTOM
on	
ascent	RISKFACTOR
to	RISKFACTOR
altitude	RISKFACTOR
.	

This	
hyperventilation	SYMPTOM
leads	
to	
hypocapnic	CONDITION
alkalosis	CONDITION
that	
,	
during	
sleep	
,	
inhibits	
ventilation	
.	

Thus	
,	
repetitive	
cycles	
of	
apnea	CONDITION
and	
hyperpnea	SYMPTOM
develop	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

The	
obvious	
precipitating	
factor	
for	
the	
development

this	
periodic	SYMPTOM

is

it	
would

the

this	
respiratory	SYMPTOM

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
hypoxia	
itself	
may	
have	
an	
important	
role	
in	
disturbing

Thus	
,	
sleep

may	
improve	
during	
acclimatization	
to	
altitude	
even	
if	
the	
amount

actually	
increases

The	
complications

,	
which	
are	
generally	
limited	
to

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
product	
of	
the	
hyperventilation	SYMPTOM
induced	
by	
the	
hypobaric	CONDITION
hypoxia	CONDITION
encountered	
at	
altitude	
.	

At	
2,500	
meters	
the	
atmo-	
spheric	
pressure	
is	
approximately	
570	
mm	
Hg	
and	
the	
ideal	
alveolar	TEST
PO2	TEST
around	
55	
mm	
Hg	
(	
depending	
on	
the	
level	
of	
PaCO2	TEST
)	
.	

Actual	
arterial	TEST
PO2	TEST
values	
will	
be	
lower	
,	
especially	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
shows	
a	
steep	
increase	
in	
ventilation	
when	
the	
arterial	TEST
PO2	TEST
level	
drops	
below	
55	
mm	
Hg	
.	

The	
increases	
in	
venti-	
lation	
associated	
with	
hypoxemia	CONDITION
result	
in	
hypocapnic	CONDITION
alkalosis	CONDITION
.	CONDITION

Because	
PaCO2	TEST
is	
the	
principal	
stimulus	
to	
respiration	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
a	
low	
PaCO2	TEST
can	
yield	
a	
loss	
or	
reduction	
in	
respiratory	
drive	
,	
resulting	
in	
central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
or	
hypopnea	CONDITION

The	
greater	
the	
ventilatory	
response

the

Thus

individuals

this	
respiratory	
pattern	
.	

Over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
apnea	CONDITION
,	
the	
PaO2	TEST
falls	
and	
PaCO2	TEST
rises	
,	
eventually	
stimulating	
a	
resumption	
of	
ventilation	
.	

However	
,	
after	
several	
large	
breaths	
,	
the	
PaCO2	TEST
again	
falls	
below	
the	
apnea	CONDITION
threshold	
,	
initiating	
another	
pause	
in	
breathing	
.	

This	
cycle	
is	
then	
repeated	
over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
night	
.	

Of	
note	
,	
the	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
often	
improved	
during	
REM	
sleep	
with	
reduced	
cycling	
.	

This	
is	
likely	
due	
to	
the	
decreased	
hypoxic	CONDITION
and	
hypercapnic	
responsiveness	
characteristic	
of	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Of	
interest	
,	
in	
one	
study	
the	
hypoxic	CONDITION
This	
resulted	
in	
a	
lower	
PaCO2	TEST
and	
higher	
PaO2	TEST

The	
reduction	
in	
peri-	
odic	
breathing	
in	
some	
individuals	
with	
adaptation	
to	
altitude	
despite	
a	
greater	
venti-	
latory	
response	
to	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
may	
be	
due	
to	
a	
lowering	
of	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

Other	
studies	
have	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
continues	
to	
increase	
over	
three	
days	
to	
two	
weeks	
of	
acclimatization	
despite	
improvements	
in	
oxygen	TEST
saturation	TEST
.	

The	
increase	
in	
both	
periodic	
breathing	
and	
oxygen	TEST
saturation	TEST
is	
thought	
to	
be	
due	
to	
increased	
controller	
gain	
of	
the	
respiratory	
system	
.	

A	
number	
of	
studies	
have	
found	
that	
the	
impairment	
of	
sleep	
architecture	
does	
not	
correlate	
with	
the	
degree	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

One	
study	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
was	
greater	
on	
the	
third	
night	
at	
altitude	
compared	
to	
the	
first	
night	
.	

However	
,	
both	
the	
nocturnal	
oxygen	TEST

and	
amount	
of	
stage	
N3	
also	
increased	
on	
the

to	
the

approximately	
12

(

in

The	
cycle	
length	
is	
commonly	
less

40

This	
breathing	
pattern	
occurs	
only	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
with	
more	
rhythmic	
respiration	
during	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Because	
this	
breathing	
pattern	
is	
a	
physiologic	
adaptation	
to	
altitude	
,	
there	
is	
no	
specific	
number	
of	
apneas	
per	
hour	
of

that	
is	
considered

Frequent

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Primary	
CSA	CONDITION
is	
caused	
by	
instability	
of	
the	
respiratory	
control	
system	
in	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
and	
less	
commonly	
during	
stable	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

	
Central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
in	
patients	
with	
primary	
CSA	CONDITION
most	
often	
occurs	
during	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
and	
is	
rare	
during	
stages	

N3	
and	
R	
sleep	
.	

	
Central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
tend	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
high	
or	
increased	
ventilatory	
responsiveness	
to	
CO2	
.	

	
Arterial	TEST
PCO2	TEST
levels	
below	
the	
hypocapnic	
apnea	
threshold	
lead	
to	
a	
cessation	
in	
ventilatory	
effort	
and	
,	
therefore	
,	
a	
central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
Individuals	
with	
high	
CO2	
ventilatory	
responsiveness	
tend	
to	
have	
lower	
PaCO2	TEST
levels	
(	
both	
daytime	
and	
sleep	
)	
and	
a	
lower	
gradient	
between	
the	
sleep-	
ing	
PaCO2	TEST
and	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

Hence	
,	
a	
smaller	
increase	
in	
ventilation	
is	
required	
to	
reach	
this	
apnea	
threshold	
and	
inhibit	
ventilation	
.	

Individuals	
with	
high	
chemore-	
sponsiveness	
also	
hyperventilate	SYMPTOM
more	
in	
response	
to	
small	
changes	
in	
arterial	
PaCO2	TEST
.	

This	
again	
often	
drives	
the	
PaCO2	TEST
below	
the

the

Objective	
Findings	
The	
PSG	TEST
of	
the	
patient	
with

demonstrates	
more	
than	
five	
central	CONDITION

and/or	
central	CONDITION

per	
hour	
of

The

meet	
criteria	
for	
these

Published	
studies	
of

required	
that	
>	
50	
%

85

Periodic

characterized	
by	
episodes	
of

separated	
by

may	
occur	
.	

The	
inter-

is	
typically	
brief	
with	
a	
maximum	
of	
five

The

does	
not	
have	
the

Normal	
individuals	
may	
have	
a	
few	
central	CONDITION

in	
the	
wake

sleep	
transition

However	
,	
once	
stable

is	
achieved	
,	
these	
apneas	CONDITION
Normal	
individuals	
should	
not	
have	
more	
than	
five	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
.	

Primary	
CSA	CONDITION
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
sleep	
related	
breathing	
disorders	
.	

Some	
patients	
with	
predominantly	
OSA	CONDITION
will	
have	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
during	
diagnostic	TEST
or	
positive	TEST

These	
apneas	
tend	
to	
resolve	
immediately	
or	
over

positive	TREATMENT
airway	TREATMENT
pressure	TREATMENT
treatment	TREATMENT

The	
pattern	
of	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
in	
primary	
CSA	CONDITION
differs	
from	
that	
of	
CSA	CONDITION
with	
CSB	CONDITION
.	

Primary	
CSA	CONDITION
lacks	
the	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
respiration	
between	
contiguous	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
noted	
in	
patients	
with	
CSA	CONDITION
with	
CSB	CONDITION
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
is	
longer	
in	
CSB	CONDITION
(	
greater	
than	
40	
seconds	
and	
typically	
45	
to	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

The	
longer	
cycle	
length	
in	
CSB	CONDITION
versus	
primary	
CSA	CONDITION
is	
due	
to	
a	
longer	
respiratory	
phase	
between	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
In	
primary	CONDITION
CSA	CONDITION
,	
the	
apnea	
is	
often	
terminated	
abruptly	
by	
a	
large	
breath	
,	
and	
there	
are	
usually	
no	
more	
that	
4	
to	
5	
breaths	
between	
apneas	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
most	
patients	
with	
Cheyne	CONDITION

Stokes	CONDITION
respiration	CONDITION
will	
have	
a	
history	
of	
congestive	CONDITION
heart	CONDITION
failure	CONDITION
or	
a	
neurological	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
.	

Patients	
with	
central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
due	
to	
substance	
use	
,	
particularly	
potent	
long	
-	
acting	
narcotics	
,	
may	
exhibit	
periodic	
breathing	
with	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
,	
but	
the	
pattern	
of	
ventilation	
between	
apneas	
does	
not	
have	
a	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
and	
the	
cycle	
length	
is	
shorter	
than	
40	
seconds	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
underlying	
pattern	
of	
breathing	
is	
often	
ataxic	
(	
irregular	
varia-	
tions	
in	
cycle	
length	
and	
tidal	TEST
volume	TEST
)	
and	
a	
low	
respiratory	
rate	
may	
be	
noted	
.	

Unlike	
primary	CONDITION
CSA	CONDITION
,	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
can	
occur	
during	
stage	
N3	
in	
patients	
taking	
opioids

Patients	
with	
CSA	CONDITION
due	
to	
medical	
or	
neurological	
conditions	
not	
of	
the	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
pattern	
often	
have	
a	
history	
of	
a	
known	
neurological	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
(	
recent	
cerebrovascular	CONDITION
accident	CONDITION
)	
but	
in	
others	
a	
high	
index	
of	
suspicion	
for	
an	
underlying	
disorder	
is	
indi-	
cated	
.	

For	
example	
,	
patients	
with	
Chiari	CONDITION
malformation	CONDITION
may	
present	
in	
adulthood	
with	
unexplained	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
and	
relatively	
few	
other	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
.	

Thus	
,	
primary	
CSA	CONDITION
is	
a	
diagnosis	
based	
on	
careful	
exclusion	
of	
other	
causes	
of

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
etiology	
of	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
is	
not	
completely	
understood	
.	

Although	
comorbid	
OSA	CONDITION
is	
common	
,	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
and	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
The	
importance	
of	
various	
factors	
leading	
to	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
likely	
varies	
among	
patients	
.	

It	
has	
been	
postulated	
that	
sustained	
nocturnal	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
results	
from	
the	
development	
of	
short	
(	
due	
to	
apnea	CONDITION
-	CONDITION
hypopnea	CONDITION
)	
or	
longer	
(	
secondary	
to	
hypoven-	
tilation	
)	
periods	
of	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
accompanied	
by	
inadequate	
compensation	
(	
i.e.	
,	
CO2	
unloading	
)	
during	
periods	
of	
ventilation	
between	
obstructive	
events	
.	

Abnormal	
venti-	
latory	
control	
(	
blunted	
hypercapnic	SYMPTOM
ventilatory	
response	
)	
allows	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
to	
persist	
into	
wakefulness	
after	
the	
cause	
of	
acute	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
is	
no	
longer	
present	
.	

A	
chronic	
hypercapnic	SYMPTOM
state	SYMPTOM
would	
produce	
an	
elevation	
of	
bicarbonate	
.	

Although	
this	
blunts	
the	
degree	
of	
acidosis	SYMPTOM
due	
to	
an	
elevated	
PaCO2	TEST
,	
it	
reduces	
the	
compensatory	
CO2	
ventilatory	
response

,	
may	
contribute	
to	
the	
persistence	
of	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
.	

	
Obesity	CONDITION
itself	
is	
also	
associated	
with	
several	
factors	
that	
predispose	
to	
CO2	SYMPTOM
retention	SYMPTOM
.	

	
Obesity	SYMPTOM
There	
is	
an	
increased	
work	
of	
breathing	
due	
to	
mass	
loading	
from	
the	
additional	
weight	
on	
the	
respiratory	
pump	
as	
well	
as	
resistive	
loading	
due

that	
occur	
in	
patients	
with	
the	
OHS	CONDITION
(	
leptin

The

of

is	
a

,	
primarily	
the	
failure	
of	
automatic

Research

those

Hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
worsens	
during

Essential	
Features	

This

is	
characterized	
primarily	
by	
chronic	
hypoventilation	
and	
hypercapnia	
due	
to	
prolonged	
use	
of	
medications	
or	
substances	
known	
to	
depress	
ventilatory	
drive	
and/or	
impair	
respiratory	
muscle	
mechanics

These	
agents	
include	
long

acting	
nar-	
cotics

Many

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Pulmonary	CONDITION
parenchymal	CONDITION
diseases	CONDITION
are	
characterized	
by	
altered	
lung	
volumes	
(	
e.g.	
,	
reduced	
functional	
residual	
capacity	
)	
and	
abnormal	
ventilation	
/	
perfusion	
relationships	
,	
which	
can	
result	
in	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
and	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Decreased	
lung	
volume	
is	
associated	
with	
reduced	
oxygen	
reserves	
that	
increase	
the	
risk	
of	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
.	

In	
addition	
,	
sleep	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
altered	
pattern	
of	
ventilatory	
-	
muscle	
acti-	
vation	
,	
particularly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
when	
,	
due	
to	
reduced	
activation	
of	
the	
intercos-	
tal	
and	
accessory	
muscles	
,	
there	
is	
a	
disproportionate	
ventilatory	
burden	
placed	
on	
the	
diaphragm	
.	

This	
may	
lead	
to	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
in	
patients	
with	
chest	CONDITION
wall	CONDITION
abnormalities	CONDITION
or	
in	
those	
with	
chronic	CONDITION
obstructive	CONDITION
pulmonary	CONDITION

In	
the	
latter	
,	
lung	CONDITION
hyperinfla-	CONDITION
tion	CONDITION
creates	
a	
mechanical	
disadvantage	
to	
the	
diaphragm	
.	

Many	
neurologic	CONDITION
and	
neu-	CONDITION
romuscular	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
are	
associated	
with	
impaired	
respiratory	
mechanics	
and	
reduced	
CO2	
chemosensitivity	
.	

Finally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
,	
if	
sufficiently	
severe	
,	
may	
place	
the	
patient	
near	
or	
on	
the	
steep

the	
oxyhemoglobin	CONCEPT

where	
even	
relatively	
small	
decrements	
in	
arterial	
oxygen	
tension	
result	
in	
large	
decrements	
in	
oxyhemoglobin	
saturation	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
related	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
in	
these	
patients	
may	
have	
a	
relatively	
great	
impact	
on	
oxyhemoglobin

however

when

Pulmonary	CONDITION
parenchymal	CONDITION
diseases	CONDITION
are	
characterized	
by	
altered	
lung	
volumes	
(	
e.g.	
,	
reduced	
functional	
residual

)	
and	
abnormal	
ventilation

relationships	
,	
which	
can	
result	
in	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
and	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Decreased	
lung	
volume	
is	
associated	
with	
reduced	
oxygen	
reserves	
that	
increase	
the	
risk	
of	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
.	

In	
addition	
,	
sleep	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
altered	
pattern	
of	
ventilatory	
muscle	
acti-	
vation	
,	
particularly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
when	
,	
due	
to	
reduced	
activation	
of	
the	
intercos-	
tal	
and	
accessory	
muscles	
,	
there	
is	
a	
disproportionate	
ventilatory	
burden	
placed	
on	
the	
diaphragm

This	
may	
lead	
to	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
in	
patients	
with	
chest	CONDITION

or	
chronic	CONDITION
obstructive	CONDITION
pulmonary	CONDITION

In	
the	
latter

lung	
hyperinflation	
creates	
a	
mechanical	
disadvantage	
to	
the	
diaphragm	
.	

In	
sickle	CONDITION
cell	CONDITION
anemia	CONDITION
,	
decreased	
oxyhemo-	
globin	
affinity	
may	
partly	
contribute	
to	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM

Many	
neurologic

neuromuscu-	
lar	
disorders	
are	
associated	
with	
impaired	
respiratory

reduced	
CO2

Finally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
,	
if	
sufficiently	
severe

may	
place	
the	
patient	
near

Snoring	SYMPTOM
is	
a	
respiratory	
sound	
generated	
in	
the	
upper	
airway	
during	
sleep	
that	
typically	
occurs	
during	
inspiration	
but	
may	
also	
occur	
in	
expiration	
;	
the	
snoring	SYMPTOM
described	
here	
occurs	
without	
episodes	
of	
apnea	CONDITION
,	
hypopnea	CONDITION
,	
RERAs	CONDITION
or	
hypoventilation	CONDITION
.	

The	
intensity	
of	
snoring	SYMPTOM
may	
vary	
and	
often	
will	
disturb	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
and	
even	
awaken	
the	
patient	
.	

	
Snoring	SYMPTOM
in	
this	
context	
does	
not	
cause	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
of	
daytime	
sleepiness	
or	
insomnia	CONDITION
in	
the	
patient	
.	

This	
type	
of	
snoring	SYMPTOM
has	
variously	
been	
referred	
to	
as	
habitual	
,	
primary	
or	
simple	
snoring	SYMPTOM
.	

	
Snoring	SYMPTOM
is	
a	
cardinal	
symptom	SYMPTOM

obstructive	CONDITION

A	
designation

can	
not	
be	
made	
in	
those	
who	
exhibit	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
(	
daytime	SYMPTOM

fatigue	SYMPTOM

other

the	
presence

OSA	CONDITION
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
complaints

Therefore	
,	
PSG	TEST
or	
OCST	TEST
is	
required	
in	
order	
to	
effectively	
rule	
out	
OSA	CONDITION
in	
such	
populations	
.	

It	
should	
also	
be	
noted	
that	
patients	
who	
initially	
have	
isolated	
snoring	SYMPTOM
may	
be	
at	
risk	
for	
developing	
OSA	CONDITION
with	
aging	
or	
weight	
gain	
.	

Occasional	
snoring	SYMPTOM
is	
almost	
universal	
.	

Estimates	
on	
snoring	SYMPTOM
vary	
widely	
depending	
on	
its	
definition

The	
incidence	
of	
snoring	SYMPTOM

reported	
to	
be	
10

This

includes	
a	
group	
of	
disorders	
in	
which	
the	
primary	
complaint	
is	
daytime	
sleepiness	
not	
caused	
by	
disturbed	
nocturnal	
sleep	
or	
misaligned	
circadian

.	

Other	
sleep	CONDITION

may	
be	
present

but	
they	
must	
be	
adequately	
treated	
before	
a	
diagnosis	
in	
this	
category	
can	
be	
established	
.	

In	
this	
nosology	CONCEPT
,	
the	
term	
hypersomnolence	SYMPTOM
is	
used	
to	
describe	
the	
symptom	SYMPTOM
of	
exces-	
sive	
sleepiness	
,	
whereas	
hypersomnia	CONDITION
refers	
to	
specific	
disorders	
,	
such	
as	
idiopathic	CONDITION
hypersomnia	CONDITION
Daytime	CONDITION
sleepiness	CONDITION
is	
defined	
as	
the	
inability	
to	
stay	
awake	
and	
alert	
during	
the	
major	
waking	
episodes	
of	
the	
day	
,	
resulting	
in	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
for	
sleep	
or	
unin-	
tended	
lapses	
into	
drowsiness	
or	
sleep	
.	

Sleepiness	
may	
vary	
in	
severity	
and	
is	
more	
likely	
to	
occur	
in	
sedentary	
,	
boring	
,	
and	
monotonous	
situations	
that	
require	
little	
active	
participation	
.	

Some	
patients	
are	
aware	
of	
increasing	
sleepiness	
before	
falling	
asleep	
,	
whereas	
others	
can	
fall	
asleep	
with	
little	
or	
no	
prodromal	SYMPTOM
symptoms	SYMPTOM
(

utable

In	
some	
forms	
of	
hypersomnolence	CONDITION
,	
sleepiness	
is	
associated	
with	
large	
increases	
in	
total	
daily	
amount	
of	
sleep	
without	
any	
genuine	
feeling	
of	
resto-	
ration	
.	

In	
others	
,	
sleepiness	
can	
be	
alleviated	
temporarily	
by	
naps	
but	
reoccurs	
shortly	
thereafter	
.	

In	
young	
children	
,	
sleepiness	
may	
express	
itself	
as	
excessively	
long	
night	
sleep	
or	
with	
the	
recurrence

the

In

been	
divided	
into	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
1	CONDITION
and	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
2	CONDITION
rather	
than	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
This	
change	
is	
predicated	
on	
the	
concept	
that	
absence	
of	
hypocretin	
(	
orexin	
)	
is	
a	
fundamental	
marker	
of	
the	
most	
precisely	
defined	
category	
of	
the	
disorder

Because	
some	
patients	
without	
cataplexy	CONDITION
will	
also	
have	
low	
cerebrospinal	
fluid	
(	
CSF	
)	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
,	
the	
use	
of	
the	
term	
“	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
with	CONDITION
cataplexy	CONDITION
”	
or	
“	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
-	CONDITION
cataplexy	CONDITION
”	
is	
inappropriate	
.	

The	
change	
is	
not	
intended	
to	
imply	
that	
the	
presence	
or	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
unimportant	
clinically	
nor	
that	
mea-	
suring	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
is	
obligatory	
.	

The	
motivation	
behind	
the	
decision	
to	
eliminate	
the	
subcategories	
of	
idiopathic	CONDITION
hypersomnia	CONDITION
is	
discussed	
in

use	
Kleine	CONDITION
-	CONDITION
Levin	CONDITION
syndrome	CONDITION
as	
the	
preferred	
name

recurrent	CONDITION
hypersomnia	CONDITION
is	
based	
on	
data	
suggesting	
that	
the	
condition	
is	
fairly	
homo-	
geneous	
,	
as	
well	
as	
the	
lack	
of	
definite	
evidence

Sleepiness	SYMPTOM
generally	
has	
a	
serious	
impact	
on	
the	
ability	
of	
the	
patient	
to	
function	
in	
educational	
,	
social	
,	
and	
occupational	
situations	
.	

Because	
patients	
are	
rarely	
examined	
during	
an	
attack	
of	
cataplexy	CONDITION
,	
its	
presence	
needs	
to	
be	
established	
based	
on	
the	
clinical	TEST
interview	TEST
alone	
.	

	
Cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
defined	
as	
more	
than	
one	
episode	
of	
generally	
brief	
(	
<	
2	
minutes	
)	
,	
usually	
bilaterally	
symmetrical	
sudden	
loss	
of	
muscle	
tone	
with	
retained	
consciousness	
.	

The	
episodes	
are	
precipitated	
by	
strong	
emotions	
,	
usually	
positive	
,	
with	
almost	
all	
patients	
reporting	
some	
episodes	
precipitated	
by	
emotions	
associated	
with	
laughter	
.	

The	
finding	
of	
transient	
reversible	
loss	
of	
deep	
tendon	
reflexes	
during	
an	
attack	
,	
if	
observed	
,	
is	
a	
strong	
diagnostic	
finding	
.	

In	
children	
(	
and	
rarely	
adults	
)	
,	
cataplexy	CONDITION
may	
present	
close	
to	
disease	
onset	
as	
facial	
(	
or	
generalized	
)	
hypotonia	
with	
droopy	SYMPTOM
eyelids	SYMPTOM
,	
mouth	SYMPTOM
opening	SYMPTOM
,	
and	
protruded	SYMPTOM
tongue	SYMPTOM
,	
or	
gait	SYMPTOM
unsteadiness	SYMPTOM
In	
children	
,	
anticipation	
of	
a	
reward	
is	
a	
common	
precipitant	
.	

It	
is	
important	
to	
use	
child	
-	
appropriate	
contexts	
and	
language	
when	
trying	
to	
elicit	
a	
history	
of	
cataplexy	CONDITION
in	
children	
.	

The	
cataplexy	CONDITION
phenotype	
differs	
widely	
between	
patients	
,	
ranging	
from	
sporadic	
partial	
attacks	
triggered	
by	
laughter	
,	
to	
frequent	
complete	
attacks	
of	
collapse	
brought	
about	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
emotions	
.	

In	
the	
vast	
majority	
of	
attacks	
,	
cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
bilateral	
,	
although	
patients	
sometimes	
report	
one	
side	
of	
the	
body	
to	
be	
more	
affected	
than	
the	
other	
.	

Partial	
attacks	
can	
be	
very	
subtle	
and	
sometimes	
only	
recognized	
by	
experi-	
enced	
observers	
such	
as	
the	
patient	
’s	
partner	
.	

	
Neck	SYMPTOM
weakness	SYMPTOM
,	
producing	
head	SYMPTOM
drop	SYMPTOM
,	
is	
a	
common	
complaint	
,	
whereas	
facial	SYMPTOM
weakness	SYMPTOM
may	
lead	
to	
sagging	SYMPTOM
of	SYMPTOM
the	SYMPTOM
jaw	SYMPTOM
and	
dysarthria	
.	

Respiratory	
muscles	
are	
not	
involved	
although	
patients	
sometimes	
describe	
shortness	SYMPTOM
of	SYMPTOM
breath	SYMPTOM
when	
symptomatic	
.	

Attacks	
start	
abruptly	
and	
usually	
build	
up	
over	
several	
seconds	
,	
especially	
in	
attacks	
producing	
complete	
peripheral	SYMPTOM

Although	
many	
emotions	
can	
potentially	
lead	
to	
cataplexy	CONDITION
,	
those	
associated	
with	
mirth	
are	
usually	
the	
most	
potent	
.	

Laughing	
out	
loud	
,	
telling	
a	
joke	
,	
and	
making	
a	
witty	
remark	
are	
typical	
examples	
.	

The	
frequency	
of	
cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
variable	
,	
ranging	
from	
less	
than	
one	
attack	
per	
month	
to	
more	
than	
20	
attacks	
per	
day	
.	

	
Cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
generally	
short	
-	
lived	
,	
lasting	
a	
matter	
of	
seconds	
,	
with	
the	
vast	
majority	
of	
attacks	
lasting	
less	
than	
two	
minutes	
.	

However	
,	
if	
a	
particular	
trigger	
continues	
,	
consecutive	
attacks	
may	
merge	
together	
to	
form	
what	
seems	
to	
be	
one	
long	
episode	
.	

Sudden	
withdrawal	
of	
anticataplectic	TREATMENT
medication	TREATMENT
,	
especially	
anti-	TREATMENT

,	
can	
result	
in	
“

”	
in	
which	
long

lasting	
attacks	
happen	
virtually	
continuously

Many	
patients	
report	
disruption	
of	
nocturnal

can	
sometimes	
be	
of	
major	
concern

Although	
sleep

an	
inability	
to

Complications	
Onset

after	
five	
years

age	
and	
most	
typically	
between	
ages	
10

a	
bimodal	
distribution	
in	
the	
age

been	
described	
in	
some	
populations	
with	
a	
first	
peak

and	
a	
second

the	
fact

The	
diagnosis	
of	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
1	CONDITION
in	
children	
may	
be	
complicated	
because	
of	
diffi-	
culties	
performing	
the	
MSLT	TEST
,	
and	
lack	
of	
normative	
values	
in	
children	
younger

six	
years

the	
MSLT	TEST
Given	
these	
difficulties	
,	
CSF	TEST
hypocretin-1	TEST
measurements	
are	
of	
particular	
value

as	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
are	
low	
or	
undetectable	
very	
shortly	
after	
disease	
onset	
in	
children	
as	
well

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
It	
is	
now	
firmly	
established	
that	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
1	CONDITION
is	
caused	
by	
deficiencies	
in	
hypo-	
cretin	
signaling	
,	
most	
likely	
due	
to	
a	
selective	
loss	
of	
hypothalamic	
hypocretin	
pro-	
ducing	
neurons	
.	

Several	
animal	
models	
lacking	
hypocretin	
neurotransmission	
demon-	
strate	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
,	
indicating	
a	
causal	
relationship	
.	

The	
vast	
majority	
of	
patients	
(	
90	
%	
to	
95	
%	
)	
with	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
and	
cataplexy	CONDITION
have	
undetectable	
or	
low	
(	
<	
110	
pg	
/	
mL	
)	
levels	
of	
hypocretin-1	
in	
the	
CSF	
.	

Patients	
without	
cataplexy	CONDITION
can	
be	
hypocretin	
deficient	
as	
well	
,	
although	
at	
a	
much	
lower	
frequency	
,	
and	
are	
thus	
also	
classified

The	
strong	
HLA	
association	
in	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
has	
led	
to	
the	
hypothesis	
that	
auto-	
immunity	
is	
a	
likely	
etiological	
mechanism	
,	
potentially	
explaining	
the	
selectivity	
of	
neuronal	
destruction	
in	
the	
hypothalamus	
.	

However	
,	
definitive	
proof	
for	
autoimmunity	
has	
not	
been	
obtained	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
1	CONDITION
is	
essentially	
defined	
as	
a	
hypocretin	
deficiency	
syndrome	
,	
which	
is	
reflected	
in	
the	
need	
for	
objective	
measurements	
in	
the	
clinical	CONCEPT
criteria	CONCEPT
.	CONCEPT
This	
require-	
ment	
is	
further	
driven	
by	
the	
fact	
that	
many	
patients	
require	
lifelong	
treatment	TREATMENT
with	
potentially	
addictive	
medications	
,	
underscoring	
the	
importance	
of	
objective	
confirma-	
tion	
of	
the	
diagnosis	
.	

It	
is	
strongly	
recommended	
that	
the	
MSLT	TEST
be	
preceded	
by	
at	
least	
one	
week	
of	
acti-	TEST
graphic	TEST
recording	TEST
with	
a	
sleep	
log	
to	
establish	
whether	
the	
results	
could	
be	
biased	
by	
insufficient	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
,	
shift	CONDITION
work	CONDITION
,	
or	
another	
circadian	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
disorder	SYMPTOM
.	SYMPTOM

In	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
,	
the	
MSLT	TEST
demonstrates	
a	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
of	
less	
than	
eight	
minutes	
and	
typically	
less	
than	
five	
minutes	
.	

Meta	
-	
analysis	
shows	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
in	
narcoleptic	
patients	
with	
cataplexy	
of	
3.1	
±	
2.9	
minutes	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
two	
or	
more	
SOREMPs	
must	
be	
present	
.	

Recent	
data	
suggest	
that	
a	
SOREMP	
within	
15	
minutes	
of	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
is	
a	
highly	
specific	
finding	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
another	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
but	
with	
low	
sensitivity	
.	

Therefore	
,	
the	
criteria	
for	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
allow	
the	
“	
replacement	
”	
of	
one	
SOREMP	
in	
the	
MSLT	TEST
with	
a	
SOREMP	
on	
the	
preceding	
poly-	
somnogram	
.	

For	
the	
correct	
interpretation	
of	
MSLT	TEST
findings	
,	
the	
recordings	
should	
be	
performed	
with	
the	
following	
conditions	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
patient	
must	
be	
free	
of	
drugs	
that	
influence	
sleep	
for	
at	
least	
14	
days	
(	
or	
at	
least	
five	
times	
the	
half

,	
whenever

nocturnal	TEST
polysomnography	TEST
should	
be	
performed	
on	
the	
night	
immediately

other	
sleep	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
that	
could	
mimic	
the	
diagnostic	
features

Sleep	
time	
during

should	
be	
curtailed	
as	
little	
as	
possible	
with	
the	
goal	
of	
at	
least	
seven	
hours	
asleep

The

may	
demonstrate	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
amount

one

Recent	
data	
suggest	
that	
a	
SOREMP	TREATMENT

15	
minutes

a	
highly

Therefore

the

the	
“

only	
0.56

Therefore

not

IH	CONDITION

IH	CONDITION

the	
pathophysiology

is	
currently	
unknown

that	
a	
division

the	
disorder	
based	
on	
the	
length

lacks

Comparison

the

Circadian	CONCEPT
rhythms	CONCEPT
are	
endogenous	
,	
near-24	
-	
hour	
biological	
rhythms	
that	
exist	
in	
all	
living	
organisms	
.	

The	
internal	
near-24	
-	
hour	
circadian	
clock	
is	
entrained	
or	
synchro-	
nized	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
light	
-	
dark	
cycle	
.	

In	
humans	
,	
the	
endogenous	
period	
of	
the	
circa-	
dian	
oscillation	
is	
genetically	
determined	
and	
typically	
is	
slightly	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

In	
order	
to	
maintain	
entrainment	
,	
the	
endogenous	
rhythm	
must	
be	
reset	
each	
day	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
clock	
time	
.	

For	
optimal	
sleep

the

time	
should

.	

Therefore	
,	
a	
recurrent	
or	
chronic	
pattern	
of	
sleep	
and	
wake	
disturbance	
may	
result	
from	
disruption	
of	
the

system	
or	
a	
misalignment	
between	
the

In

the

may

the

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
exact	
mechanisms	
responsible	
for	
DSWPD	
are	
unknown	
.	

An	
abnormal	
interac-	
tion	
between	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	
rhythm	
and	
the	
sleep	
homeostatic	
process	
that	
regulates	
sleep	
and	
wakefulness	
may	
play	
an	
essential	
role	
in	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
DSWPD	CONDITION
.	

Early	
studies	
reported	
an	
altered	
phase	
relationship	
between	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
and	
circadian	
phase	
,	
whereas	
more	
recent	
studies	
have	
failed	
to	
support	
this	
finding

In	
chil-	
dren	
and	
adults	
,	
voluntary	
behaviors	
such	
as	
staying	
awake	
late	
at	
night	
and	
waking	
up	
late	
in	
the	
morning	
or	
afternoon	
may	
result	
in	
an	
abnormal	
relationship	
between	
the	
endogenous	
circadian	CONCEPT

and	
the	
sleep	
homeostatic	
process	
that	
regulates	
sleep

)	
,	
thereby	
promoting	
and	
perpetuating	
the	
delay	
in	
the	
circadian	
sleep	
phase	
.	

Given	
a	
sufficient	
discrepancy	
between	
early	
and	
late	
wake	
times	
,	
early	
wake	
times	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
bright	
light	
exposure	
during	
the	
maximal	
phase

region	
,	
perpetuating	
the	
cir-

Individuals	
may	
have	
alterations	
in	
sensitivity	
to	
the	
phase	
shifting	
effects	
of	
light	
.	

For	
example	
,	
partial	
sleep	
deprivation	
encountered	
with	
this	
disorder	
can	
also	
attenuate	
the	
ability	
to	
phase

further	
perpetuating	
the

The	
prevalence	
of	
ASWPD	
in	
the	
general	
population	
is	
unknown

In	
one	
large	
survey	
study	
involving	
middle	
-	
aged	
adults	
(	
40	
-	
64	
years	
)	
,	
the	
population	
prevalence	
was	
esti-	
mated	
at	
1	
%	
,	
although	
it	
is	
unclear	
what	
proportion	
of	
these	
subjects	
would	
deem	
their	
schedule	
to	
be	
significantly	
troublesome	
so	
as	
to	
warrant	
clinical	
attention	
.	

Until	
the	
identification

(

,	
only	
four

were	
described	
in

ASWPD	CONDITION
may	
be	
particularly	
profound

Developmental	
Issues	
ASWPD	CONDITION
is	
most	
frequently	
encountered	
among	
older	
age	
groups	
.	

An	
early	
age	
of	
onset	
of	
ASWPD	CONDITION
This	
is	
particularly	
true	
for	
younger	
chil-	
dren	
,	
who	
may	
require	
adult	
supervision	
once	
they	
are	
awake	
.	

However	
,	
this	
complaint	
regarding	
the	
waking	
pattern	
is	
often	
more	
related	
to	
unrealistic	
caregiver	
expecta-	
tions	
regarding	
an	
“	
appropriate	
”	
wake	
time	
for	
a	
young	
child	
and/or	
a	
developmentally	
inappropriate	
early	
bedtime	
resulting	
in	
prolonged	
time	
in	
bed	
,	
rather	
than	
to	
a	
true	
advance	
in	
sleep	
onset	
and	
offset	
.	

In	
some	
cases	
,	
children	
are	
motivated	
to	
wake	
up	
earlier	
than	
desired	
because	
they	
are	
reinforced	
for	
this	
behavior	
by	
parental	
attention	
or	
the	
opportunity	
to	
watch	
television	
or	
utilize	
other	
media	
upon	
waking	
.	

The	
com-	
plaint	
that	
a	
child	
“	
falls	
asleep	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
evening	
,	
especially	
in	
adolescence	
,	
is	
rare	
and	
should	
raise	
concerns	
regarding	
the	
possibility	
of	
chronically	SYMPTOM
insufficient	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
and/or	
a	
sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
Hypophosphorylation

,	
ultimately	
,

.	

However	
,	
genetic	
het-	
erogeneity	
is	
apparent	
within	
familial

as	
demonstrated	
by	
the	
fact	
that	
other	
cohorts

this	
same	
study	
and	
another	
study	
did	
not	
reveal	
mutations	
in	
hPer2

A	
separate	
report	
of	
a	
Japanese

a	
missense

also

Unresolved

The

suggests	
that	
clinicians	
are	
unlikely	
to	
encounter	
patients	
with	
stringently	
defined	
ASWPD	
.	

Until

only	
four	
cases	
were	
described

Various	
treatment	TREATMENT

also	
support	
this	
contention	
with	
demon-	
stration	
of	
objectively	
conventional	
sleep	
and	
wake	
times	
despite	
study

based	
on	
subjective

The	
absence	
of	
the	
early

may	
be	
due	
to	
the	
fact	
that	
the

be	
more	
readily	
modified	
than

Developmental	
Issues	
Caregivers	
may	
report	
that	
a	
child	
with	
ISWRD	CONDITION
has	
difficulty	
falling	
asleep	
at	
the	
desired	
bedtime	
or	
“	
falls	
asleep	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
evening	
,	
wakes	
“	
too	
early	
”	
or	
has	
dif-	
ficulty	
waking	
in	
the	
morning	
,	
and/or	
exhibits	
developmentally	
inappropriate	
napping	
behavior	
during	
the	
day	
.	

Parents	
may	
complain	
that	
their	
child	
sleeps	
too	
much	
or	
too	
little	
or	
at	
inappropriate	
times	
.	

Attempts	
to	
keep	
the	
child	
awake	
during	
the	
day	
,	
especially	
during	
sedentary	
activities	
,	
are	
often	
unsuccessful	
.	

The	
key	
characteristics	
that	
distinguish	
ISWRD	CONDITION
from	
other	
sleep	
complaints	
or	
circadian	
sleep	
wake	
disor-	
ders	
are	
the	
lack	
of	
prolonged	
consolidated	
sleep	
periods	
,	
the	
often	
seemingly	
random	
distribution	
in	
sleep	
periods	
across	
the	
24

and	
the	
marked

variability	
with	
little	
in	
the	
way	
of	
a	
clearly	
predictable	
major	
sleep-	
wake	
pattern	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
’	
sleep	
and	
daytime	
functioning	
is	
likely	
to	
be	
particularly	
profound	
.	

There	
may

phenotypes

children

with	
differences

The	
key	
characteristics	
that	
distinguish	
N24SWD	
from	
other	
sleep	
complaints	
or	
circadian	
sleep	
wake	
dis-	
orders	
are	
twofold	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
predictable	
pattern	
of	
misalignment	
between	
the	
child	
’s	
sleep	
patterns	
and	
the	
light	
-

cycle	
(	
progressive

;	
and	
(

)	
periods	
of	
apparent

”	
during	
those	
transient	
intervals	
when	
the	
child	
’s	
circadian	
sleep	
-	
wake	
propensity	
coincides	
with	
the	
desired	
bed	
and	
wake	
times	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
’	
sleep	
and	
daytime	
functioning	
is	
often	
profound	
.	

Although	
N24SWD	
is	
extremely	
rare	
in	
typically	
developing	
or	
sighted	
children	
,	
it	
has	
been	
reported	
with	
some	
frequency	
in	
children	
with	
intellectual	
disabilities	
and	
blindness	
.	

For	
example	
,	
children	
with	
optic	CONDITION
nerve	CONDITION
hypoplasia	CONDITION
due	
to	
a	
variety	
of	
under-	
lying	
causes	
,	
especially	
those	
children	
with	
hypoplastic	CONDITION
corpus	CONDITION
callosum	CONDITION
and	
comor-	
bid	
severe	
intellectual	
and	
visual	
impairments	
,	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
have	
features	
of	
N24SWD	
.	
N24SWD	
has	
also	
been	
described	
in	
pediatric	
patients	
with	
Rett	
syndrome	
(	
a	
genetic	
disorder	
occurring	
almost	
exclusively	
in	
girls	
,	
characterized	
by	
severe	
developmental	
regression	
,	
language	
delays	
,	
and	
limited	
social	
interactions	
)	
,	
autism

,	
and	
Angelman

a	
neurodevelopmental	
disorder	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
an	
abnormality	
of	
chromosome	
15q11	
-	
q13	
.	

The	
common	
mechanism	
in	
all	
of	
these	
disorders	
is	
postulated	
to	
be	
lack	
of	
entrainment	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
that	
results	
from	
the	
failure	
to	
perceive	
and/or	
attend	
to	
social	
/	
environmental	
zeitgebers	
(	
time	
cues	
)	
.	

There	
have	
also	
been	
several	
case	
reports	
which	
describe	
the	
emergence	
of	
N24SWD	
in	
intellectually	
normal	
sighted	
children	
or	
adolescents	
who	
have	
limited	
or	
inappropriate	
exposure	
to	
environmental

other	
entraining	
cues	
(

These	
individuals	
are	
likely	
to	
have	
significant	
psychiatric	
impairments	
that	
predispose	
them	
to	
avoid-	
ance

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
intrinsic	
period	
of	
the	
human	
circadian	CONCEPT
pacemaker	CONCEPT
is	
usually	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
and	
requires	
daily	
input	
from	
the	
environment	
to	
maintain	
synchrony	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
.	

The	
light	
-	
dark	
cycle	
is	
the	
most	
important	
environmental	
time	
cue	
(	
zeitgeber	
)	
in	
humans	
(	
as	
in	
other	
species	
)	
,	
although	
nonphotic	
time	
cues	
also	
play	
a	
role	
in	
normal	
entrainment	
.	

A	
lack	
of	
photic	
input	
to	
the	
circadian	CONCEPT
pacemaker	CONCEPT
is	
clearly	
the	
cause	
of	
nonentrained	
rhythms	
in	
totally	SYMPTOM
blind	SYMPTOM
people	
.	

It	
has	
been	
suggested	
that	
,	
in	
sighted	
individuals	
,	
a	
systematic	
delay	
due	
to	
inadequate	
exposure	
to	
light	
may	
contribute	
to	
the	
development	
of	
N24SWD	CONDITION
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
disorder	
may	
be	
caused	
by	
an	
extremely	
prolonged	
endogenous	
circadian	CONCEPT
period	CONCEPT
that	
is	
outside	
of	
the	
range	
for	
entrainment	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
or	
by	
an	
alteration	
in	
the	
response	
of	
the	
circadian	CONCEPT
clock	CONCEPT
to	
the	
entraining	
effects	
of	
light

different	
results

Serial

the

follows	
an

Demographics	
The

on	
the	
prevalence	
of

work	
in	
the	
population

It	
has	
been	
estimated	
that	
approximately	
20	
%	
of	
the	
workforce	
in	
indus-	
trialized	
countries	
is	
employed	
in	
a	
job

Because	
shift

fatigue	SYMPTOM

be	
a

often	
counteracted

Human	
consciousness	
consists	
of	
three	
essential	
states	
:	
Wake	
,	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
and	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
three	
states	
are	
modulated	
by	
a	
host	
of	
influences	
including	
the	
degree	
of	
ami-	
nergic	
and	
cholinergic	
neurochemical	
bias	
,	
central	
nervous	
system	
(	
CNS	
)	
activation	
,	
Parasomnias	CONDITION
and	
the	
degree	
of	
endogenous	
versus	
exogenous	
input	
.	

Under	
normal	
physiologic	
conditions	
,	
which	
include	
homeostatic	
drive	
and	
circadian	
rhythmicity	
,	
the	
process	
of	
state	
declaration	
is	
maintained	
in	
a	
stable	
and	
predictable	
fashion	
throughout	
a	
24	
-	
hour	
period	
.	

However	
,	
as	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
oscillates	
,	
the	
normally	
distinct	
states	
of	
con-	
sciousness	
may	
be	
rendered	
into	
a	
state	
that	
is	
not	
fully	
declared	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
tempo-	
rary	
unstable	
state	
of	
dissociation	CONDITION
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
and	
wake	
can	
be	
viewed	
as	
occurring	
on	
a	
spectrum	
rather	
than	
being	
entirely	
dichotomous	
states	
.	

	
Parasomnias	CONDITION
are	
the	
result	
of	
such	
state	
dissociation	CONDITION
Recent	
research	
has	
shown	
that	
com-	
binations	
of	
one	
or	
more	
of	
these	
states	
do	
occur	
and	
may	
result	
in	
unstable	
states	
of	
altered	
consciousness	
manifesting	
as	
parasomnias	CONDITION

The	
comingling	
of	
basic	
states

consciousness	
is	
the

different	
forms

are	
thought	
to

to	
the	
occurrence	
of	
NREM	
parasomnias

NREM	
disorders	
of

frequently	
appear	
to	
involve	
the	
disinhibition	
of	
“

”	
such	
as	
feeding	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
aggression	
.	

Here	
,	
it	
has	
been	
postulated	
that	
central	
pattern	
generators	
elicit	
primal	
fixed	
action	
patterns	
that	
would	
otherwise	
have	
been	
inhibited	
by	
the	
prefrontal	
cortex	
during	
wake	
.	

In	
this	
regard	
,	
aggression	
is	
typ-	
ically	
abrupt	
in	
onset	
and	
characterized	
by	
apparent	
instinctual	
defensive	
posturing	
as	
opposed	
to	
behaviors	
that	
are	
complex	
and	
procedural	
.	

These	
can	
emerge	
in	
pathologic	
forms	
with	
the	
parasomnias

the

It	
is	
frequently	
pos-	
sible	
to	
correlate	
observed

with	
later	
descriptions

the

The

Unlike

which	
typ-

entail	
more

the

Behaviors	
can	
be	
simple

non

goal	
-	
directed	
,

complex

protracted

and	
may	
involve	
inappro-

sexual	
activity	
with	
oneself	
or	
an	
individual	
in	
close	
proximity	
such	
as	
a	
bed	
partner

The	
ambulation	
may	
terminate	
spontaneously

at	
times	
in	
inappropriate	
places

continue	
to	
sleep	
without	
reach-	
ing	
conscious	
awareness	
at	
any	
point

The	
sleepwalking	
individual	
is	
disoriented	
in	
time

place	
,	
with	
slow	
speech	
,	
with	
severely	
diminished

Alcohol

However	
,	
the

makes	
these

unreliable

In

Sleepwalking	SYMPTOM

and	
Complications	
Confusional	SYMPTOM
arousals	SYMPTOM
most	
often	
appear	
in	
early	
childhood	
around	
the	
age	
of	
two	
years	
.	

This	
childhood	
form	
of	
confusional	SYMPTOM
arousals	SYMPTOM
is	
typically	
benign	
,	
but	
may	
cause	
concern	
in	
parents	
.	

	
Confusional	SYMPTOM
arousals	SYMPTOM
of	
early	
childhood	
diminish	
in	
occurrence	
after	
the	
age	
of	
five	
years	
.	

	
Sleepwalking	SYMPTOM
can	
begin	
as	
soon	
as	
a	
child	
is	
able	
to	
walk	
but	
may	
begin	
at	
almost	
any	
time	
in	
the	
life	
cycle	
,	
including	
as	
late	
as	
the	
seventh	
decade	
.	

	
Sleepwalking	SYMPTOM
is	
often	
preceded	
by	
confusional	SYMPTOM
arousals	SYMPTOM
Childhood	
sleepwalking	
usually	
disappears	
sponta-	
neously	
around	
puberty	
but	
may	
persist	
into	
adolescence	
.	

Episodes	
can	
occur	
sporad-	
ically	
or	
with	
high	
frequency	
,	
such	
as	
multiple	
times	
nightly	
for	
several	
consecutive	
nights	
.	

Sleepwalking	
may	
occur	
for	
the	
first	
time	
in	
adulthood	
or	
may	
recur	
in	
adult-	
hood	
during	
periods	
of	
sleep	SYMPTOM
deprivation	SYMPTOM
or	
stress	
.	

	
Sleep	SYMPTOM
terrors	SYMPTOM
usually	
emerge	
in	
children	
aged	
four	
to	
12	
years	
(	
but	
can	
also	
emerge	
in	
adulthood	
)	
and	
tend	
to	
resolve	
spontaneously	
by	
early	
adolescence	
,	
as	
does	
sleep-	
walking	
.	

Social	
embarrassment	
over	
the	
sleep	SYMPTOM
terrors	SYMPTOM
can	
impair	
social	
relationships	
in	
children	
and	
adults	
.	

Serious	
or	
even	
lethal	
injuries	
can	
occur	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
noted	
above	
,	
disorders	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
most	
often	
occur	
initially	
in	
childhood	
and	
decrease	
in	
occurrence	
steadily	
until	
young	
adulthood	
.	

However	
,	
they	
may	
occur	
for	
the	
first	
time	
in	
adulthood	
or	
reappear	
after	
many	
asymptomatic	
years	
,	
often	
related	
to	
stress	
,	
sleep	SYMPTOM
deprivation	SYMPTOM
,	
or	
development	
of	
another	
sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
overwhelming	
majority	
of	
individuals	
with	
disorders	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
do	
not	
have	
neuro-	
logical	
or	
psychological	
pathology	
.	

There	
are	
rare	
reported	
cases	
of	
confusional	
arous-	
als	
associated	
with	
brain	
lesions	
in	
areas	
subserving	
arousal	
,	
such	
as	
the	
posterior	
hypothalamus	
,	
midbrain	
reticular	
area	
,	
and	
periventricular	
gray	
matter	
.	

However	
,	
data	
from	
a	
single	
patient	
with	
confusional	
arousals	
suggest	
that	
they	
may	
be	
due	
to	
a	
func-	
tional	
abnormality	
in	
the	
brain	
that	
leaves	
some	
regions	
,	
such	
as	
hippocampus	
and	
Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
frontal	
associative	
cortices	
,	
asleep	
,	
while	
other	
parts	
of	
the	
brain	
such	
as	
motor	
,	
cingu-	
late	
,	
insular	
,	
amygdala	
,	
and	
temporopolar	
cortices	
,	
are	
active	
or	
awake	
.	

It	
is	
generally	
considered	
that	
disorders	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
represent	
a	
dissociation	
of	
different	
regions	
of	
the

Objective	
Findings	

Although	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
for	
the	
evaluation	
of	
typical	
,	
uncomplicated	
,	
and	
non-	
injurious	
parasomnias	
,	
polysomnographic	TEST

demonstrate	
that	
disorders	CONDITION

arousal	CONDITION
typically	
begin	
after	
an	
arousal	
from	
slow

most	
commonly	
toward	
the

Diagnostic	TEST

note	
high

and	
frequent	
arousals	
from

However	
,	
these	
findings	
have	
a	
low	
spec-

and	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
occur	
in	
other

as

and	
in	
asymp-

On	
rare	
occasions	
,	
polysomnography	TEST
can

Changes	
between	
the	
home	
and	
sleep	
laboratory	
environment	
,	
timing	
,	
habits

and	
other	
factors	
may	
serve	
to	
decrease	
the

In

Although	
the	
“

of

(	
i.e.

the	
cycling

various	
NREM

is	
generally	
preserved

,	
the

be	
perturbed

Power	TEST

including	
high	
amounts

fragmentation	
(

during

a

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
should	
be	
carefully	
distinguished	
from	
other	
disorders	
with	
similar	
presentations	
,	
but	
different	
pathophysiologies	
,	
courses	
,	
and	
treatments	
.	

Other	
disorders	
to	
be	
considered	
include	
RBD	CONDITION
,	
sleep	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
epilepsy	CONDITION
,	
sleep	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
dissocia-	CONDITION
tive	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
,	
alcohol	CONDITION
and	CONDITION
drug	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
behaviors	CONDITION
,	
and	
OSA	CONDITION
.	

	
RBD	CONDITION
typically	
presents	
as	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
during	
the	
second	
half	
of	
the	
night	
and	
usually	
affects	
middle	
-	
aged	
men	
,	
but	
also	
can	
affect	
women	
and	
virtually	
any	
age	
group	
.	

Because	
sleepwalking	CONDITION
in	
adults	
can	
also	
present	
as	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
that	
emerge	
during	
any	
time	
of	
the	
night	
,	
vPSG	TEST
may	
be	
necessary	
to	
distinguish	
sleep-	
walking	
from	
RBD	CONDITION
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
signs	
of	
RBD	CONDITION
,	
particularly	
tonic	
/	
phasic	
EMG	
activity	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
are	
almost	
always	
present	
during	
sleep	TEST
studies	TEST
.	

If	
sleepwalking	CONDITION
(	
or	
sleep	SYMPTOM
terrors	SYMPTOM
)	
occurs	
with	
RBD	CONDITION
This	
has	
been	
referred	
to	
as	
a	
parasomnia	CONDITION
overlap	
disorder	
.	

Other	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
such	
as	
OSA	CONDITION
,	
can	
precipitate	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Therefore	
,	
a	
careful	
history	
must	
be	
obtained	
to	
identify	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
.	

	
Sleep	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
epilepsy	CONDITION
can	
manifest	
with	
wandering	SYMPTOM
behavior	SYMPTOM
or	
with	
frenzied	SYMPTOM
walking	SYMPTOM
or	
running	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
malingering	CONDITION
also	
should	
be	
considered	
.	

If	
a	
neurologic	
or	
medical	
disor-	
der	
is	
identified	
as	
the	
precipitant	
of	
a	
disorder	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
,	
then	
the	
sleepwalking	
should	
be	
diagnosed	
as	
parasomnia	CONDITION
due	
to	
a	
medical	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
.	

	
Disorders	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
should	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
in	
the	
presence	
of	
alcohol	CONDITION
intoxication	CONDITION
However	
,	
the	
sleepwalker	CONDITION
is	
typically	
severely	
cognitively	
impaired	
,	
but	
with	
only	
limited	
motor	
impairment	
.	

The	
alcohol	CONDITION

intoxicated	CONDITION
individual	
’s	
level	
of	
cognitive	
functioning	
may	
be	
reduced	
,	
but	
not	
absent

whereas	
motor	
behavior	
is	
often	
severely	
impaired	
.	

In	
alcoholic	SYMPTOM
blackouts	SYMPTOM
,	
where	
anterograde	CONDITION
amnesia	CONDITION
is	
,	
by	
definition	
,	
Parasomnias	CONDITION
Parasomnias	CONDITION
the	
cardinal	
manifestation	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
note	
that	
outward	
motor	
behavior	
and	
cog-	
nitive	
function	
may	
not	
be	
impaired	
and	
may	
be	
perceived	
as	
normal	
.	

Thus	
,	
the	
impor-	
tance	
of	
appreciating	
the	
neuroscience	CONCEPT
of	
alcoholic	SYMPTOM
blackouts	SYMPTOM
and	
its	
potential	
role	
in	
the	
explanation	
of	
unusual	
and	
bizarre	
nocturnal	
behaviors	
can	
not	
be	
understated	
because	
these	
can	
mimic	
parasomnias	CONDITION
.	

The	
former	
are	
exponentially	
more	
prevalent

thus	
should	
be	
given	
appropriate	
weight	
when

Essential	
Features	
SRED	CONCEPT
On	
the	
one	
hand	
,	
some	
patients	
can	
not	
be	
easily	
brought	
to	
full	
consciousness	
during	
an	
episode	
of	
eating	
,	
as	
is	
the	
case	
with	
sleepwalking	
,	
and	
may	
have	
no	
recall	
of	
having	
eaten	
during	
the	
night	
.	

On	
the	
other	
hand	
,	
some	
patients	
seemingly	
have	
considerable	
alertness	
during	
an	
episode	
and	
have	
substantial	
recall	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

There	
may	
be	
variability	
of	
awareness	
and	
subsequent	
recall	
within	
one	
night	
,	
and	
across	
the	
evolution	
of	
the	
disorder	
in	
individual	
patients	
.	

The	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
involuntary	
eating	
and	
drinking	
during	
the	
main	
sleep	
period	
are	
typically	
associated	
with	
a	
feeling	
of	
lack	
of	
control	
over	
eating	
.	

Problematic	
features	
of	
the	
recurrent	
sleep	
related	
eating	
include	
the	
following	
:	
con-	
sumption	
of	
peculiar	
forms	
or	
combinations	
of	
food	
,	
or

Sleepwalking	SYMPTOM
is	
the	
most	
common	
sleep	
disorder	
associated	
with

once

on	
the	
stove	
or	
in	
the	
oven	
,	
and	
then	
abandons	
them	
.	

A	
variety	
of	
other	
complications	
have	
been	
described	
previously	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
SRED	CONDITION
can	
emerge	
in	
childhood	
,	
either	
associated	
or	
unassociated	
with	
a	
family	
history	
of	
SRED	CONDITION
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
SRED	CONDITION
is	
unclear	
.	

Despite	
the	
broad	
range	
of	
pre-	
disposing	
and	
precipitating	
factors	
in	
SRED	CONDITION
,	
the	
relatively	
homogeneous	
set	
of	
clinical	
features	
suggests	
the	
presence	
of	
a	
“	
final	
common	
pathway	
”	
that	
can	
be	
accessed	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
factors	
.	

Although	
SRED	CONDITION
has	
prominent	
features	
of	
both	
a	
sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
and	
an	
eating	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
,	
its	
relatively	
homogeneous	
presentation	
supports	
its	
classification	
as	
a	
separate	
diagnostic	
entity	
.	

More	
than	
half	
of	
patients	
with	
SRED	CONDITION
have	
a	
history	
of	
another	
parasomnia	CONDITION
that	
preceded	
the	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
eating	
,	
suggesting	
that	
the	
presence	
of	
another	
parasomnia	RISKFACTOR
is	
a	
major	
risk	
factor	
for	
SRED	CONDITION
However	
,	
the	
female	
predominance	
in	
SRED	CONDITION
is	
more	
consistent	
with	
eating	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
,	
which	
are	
female	
pre-	
dominant	
,	
than	
with	
sleepwalking	
or	
movement	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
(	
RLS	CONDITION
/	
PLMD	CONDITION
)	
which	
have	
slight	
to	
no	
female	
bias	
.	

Thus	
it	
appears	
that	
two	
basic	
drive	
states	
—	
sleeping	
and	
eating	
—	
are	
pathologically	
intertwined	
in	
SRED	
.	

Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
Objective	
Findings	
Although	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
in	
the	
assessment	
of	
SRED	
,	
vPSG	TEST
evaluations	
have	
often	
reported	
positive	
findings	
.	

The	
most	
common	
finding	
consists	
of	
multiple	
confu-	
sional	
arousals	
,	
with	
or	
without	
eating	
,	
arising	
from	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

However	
,	
abnor-	
mal	
arousals	
have	
been	
documented	
from	
all	
stages	
of	
NREM	
sleep	
and	
also	
occasion-	
ally	
from	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
level	
of	
consciousness	
has	
typically	
spanned	
the	
range	
from	
virtual	
unconsciousness	
to	
various	
levels	
of	
partial	
consciousness	
despite	
a	
concurrent	
EEG	TEST
pattern	
that	
is	
often	
predominantly	
awake	
,	
suggesting	
dissociation	CONCEPT
between	
the	
EEG	TEST
and	
the	
level	
of	
consciousness	
.	

This	
dissociation	CONCEPT
A	
predominant	
wake	
pattern	
is	
rare	
in	
childhood	
sleep-	
walking	
.	

	
PLMs	SYMPTOM
and	
OSA	CONDITION
may	
be	
observed	
in	
polysomnographic	
monitoring	
of	
SRED	CONDITION
patients	
.	

In	
one	
recent	
study	
that	
addressed	
the	
boundaries	
between	
SRED	CONDITION
and	
fully	
conscious	
abnormal	
nocturnal	
eating	
,	
22	
of	
35	
patients	
had	
PLMs	SYMPTOM
,	
5	
of	
35	
had	
RLS	SYMPTOM
,	
and	
29	
of	
35	
had	
recurring	
chewing	
and	
swallowing	
movements	
during	
sleep	
that	
were	
associated	
with	
nearly	
half	
of	
the	
total	
number	
of	
EEG	TEST
arousals	
.	

Differential	
Diagnosis	
SRED	CONDITION
must	
be	
distinguished	
primarily	
from	
night	CONDITION
eating	CONDITION
syndrome	CONDITION
(	
NES	CONDITION
)	
,	
which	
is	
characterized	
by	
excessive	
eating	
between	
dinner	
and	
bedtime	
and	
during	
full	
awaken-	
ings	
during	
the	
sleep	
period	
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
daytime	
eating	
disorders	
(	
bulimia	CONDITION

)	
,	
inappropriate

,	
or

,	
or	
other

activity	
,	
are	
not	
present	
in	
SRED	CONDITION
,	
although	
the	
two	
conditions	
may	
be	
comorbid	
.	

A	
person	
with	
a	
daytime

disorder	
may	
also	
have	
a	
coexisting	
SRED	CONDITION
that	
is	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
confusional	
arousals	
but	
not	
associated	
with	
purging	
behaviors	
during	
the	
night	
or	
upon	
arising	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

Patients	
with	
longstanding	
SRED	CONDITION
and	
excessive

may	
eventually	
fast	
during	
the	
daytime	
and/or	
engage	
in	
excessive	
exer-	
cise

obesity	CONDITION
from	
the	
SRED	CONDITION
.	

Likewise	
,	
patients	
who	
otherwise	
fulfill	
crite-	
ria	
for	
SRED	CONDITION
SRED	CONDITION
appears	
to	
be	
considerably	
more	
female	
predominant	
that	
NES	CONDITION
(	
which	
has	
<	
60

prevalence	
)	
,	
and	
mood	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
are	
more	
common	
with	
NES	CONDITION
than	
with	
SRED	CONDITION
.	

Nevertheless	
,	
SRED	CONDITION
and	
NES	CONDITION
share	
a	
considerable	
number	
of	
overlapping	
features	
and	
may	
exist	
along	
a	
common	
spectrum	
of	
pathophysiology	
.	

	
SRED	CONDITION
should	
also	
be	
distinguished	
from	
nocturnal

extensions	
of
