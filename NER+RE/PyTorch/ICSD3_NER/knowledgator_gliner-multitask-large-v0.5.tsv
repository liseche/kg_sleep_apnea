Finally	
,	
by	
identifying	
areas	
of	
uncertainty	
and	
overlap	
among	
related	
patholo-	
gies	
,	
these	
systems	
play	
a	
critical	
role	
in	
guiding	
future	
research	
agendas	
which	
will	
enhance	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
clinical	
features	
,	
pathophysiology	
and	
treatment	
response	
specific	
to	
each	
disorder	
.	

Since	
its	
infancy	
35	
years	
ago	
,	
the	
field	
of	
sleep	
medicine	
has	
paid	
particular	
atten-	
tion	
to	
the	
issue	
of	
classification	CONCEPT
,	
beginning	
with	
the	
1979	
American	
Sleep	
Disorders	
Association	
’s	
Diagnostic	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
and	DOCUMENT
Arousal	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
.	

Since	
that	
time	
,	
as	
our	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
sleep	
disorders	
has	
grown	
,	
several	
differ-	
ent	
structural	
approaches	
have	
been	
utilized	
in	
revisions	
of	
the	
classification	CONCEPT
system	CONCEPT
,	
culminating	
in	
the	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
,	DOCUMENT
2nd	DOCUMENT
Edition	DOCUMENT
.	

The	
organization	
of	
that	
edition	
,	
although	
not	
without	
its	
limitations	
,	
has	
proven	
effective	
and	
user	
-	
friendly	
and	
has	
been	
maintained	
in	
the	
current	
revision	
.	

Ideally	
,	
classification	CONCEPT
systems	CONCEPT
are	
based	
largely	
on	
pathophysiology	
.	

However	
,	
such	
an	
approach	
is	
dependent	
on	
adequate	
knowledge	
concerning	
the	
various	
pathophysiol-	
ogies	
of	
disease	
or	
disorder	
within	
a	
given	
discipline	
.	

As	
is	
the	
case	
with	
many	
diag-	
nostic	
systems	
,	
our	
current	
knowledge	
and	
understanding	
of	
the	
pathophysiology	
of	
many	
sleep	
disorders	
is	
inadequate	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
International	DOCUMENT

of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
,	DOCUMENT
3rd	DOCUMENT
Edition	DOCUMENT

Despite	
these	
shortcomings	
,	
this	
approach	
is	
one	
that	
has	
proven	
familiar	
and	
workable	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
clinicians	
.	

Recognizing	
the	
need	
for	
currency	
and	
relevance	
in	
a	
rapidly	
evolving	
field	
,	
the	
American	
Academy	
of	
Sleep	
Medicine	
Board	
of	
Directors	
approved	
a	
revision	
of	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
,	DOCUMENT
2nd	DOCUMENT
Edition	DOCUMENT

These	
reviews	
were	
carefully	
considered	
and	
revi-	
sions	
made	
based	
on	
this	
input	
.	

Subsequent	
to	
this	
,	
text	
revisions	
were	
begun	
and	
the	
same	
review	
process	
and	
modifications	
were	
undertaken	
once	
text	
drafts	
were	
com-	
pleted	
.	

Further	
modifications	
were	
made	
based	
on	
recommendations	
from	
the	
AASM	DOCUMENT
board	DOCUMENT
before	
finalization	
of	
the	
edition	
.	

At	
all	
points	
in	
this	
process	
,	
efforts	
were	
made	
to	
rely	
as	
heavily	
as	
possible	
on	
available	
and	
current	
scientific	
evidence	
.	

However	
,	
due	
to	
the	
paucity	
of	
available	
evidence	
in	
many	
areas	
,	
decisions	
regarding	
the	
nosol-	
ogy	
were	
often	
made	
by	
consensus	
of	
the	
work	
groups	
,	
task	
force	
,	
and	
reviewers	
.	

Using	
ICSD-3	DOCUMENT
As	
noted	
above	
,	
the	
general	
structure	
of	
the	
current	
edition	
closely	
parallels	
that	
of	
the	
second	
edition	
.	

The	
major	
clinical	
divisions	
remain	
unchanged	
.	

As	
with	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
,	
2nd	
Edition	
,	
pediatric	TEST
diagnoses	TEST
are	
fully	
integrated	
into	
the	
major	
clinical	TEST
diagnoses	TEST
,	
with	
the	
exception	
of	
obstructive	CONDITION
sleep	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION

Where	
pediatric	
presentations	
call	
for	
variation	
in	
the	
diagnostic	
criteria	
,	
those	
variations	
are	
noted	
within	
the	
criteria	
section	
.	

In	
an	
effort	
to	
better	
identify	
those	
clinical	
features	
of	
a	
disorder	
which	
are	
developmentally	
-	
specific	
,	
a	
text	
heading	
for	
Developmental	
Issues	
has	
been	
added	
for	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

Specific	
ICD	DOCUMENT
codes	
(	
9	DOCUMENT
-	DOCUMENT
CM	DOCUMENT
and	
10	DOCUMENT
-	DOCUMENT
CM	DOCUMENT
)	DOCUMENT
are	
listed	
at	
the	
beginning	
of	
each	
diagnosis	
.	

Because	
of	
the	
complexities	
and	
differences	
between	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
diagnoses	
and	
the	
ICD	DOCUMENT
system	
,	
assign-	
ment	
of	
codes	
is	
challenging	
.	

These	
issues	
are	
discussed	
further	
under	
Coding	
below	
.	

Although	
classification	
systems	
are	
,	
by	
their	
nature	
,	
intended	
to	
define	
disorders	
in	
the	
most	
specific	
terms	
possible	
,	
clinicians	
must	
recognize	
that	
there	
is	
inevitably	
some	
degree	
of	
variability	
in	
presentation	
which	
may	
result	
in	
clinically	CONDITION
significant	CONDITION
conditions	CONDITION

Clinicians	
should	
note	
that	
most	
diagnoses	
within	
the	
International	DOCUMENT
Classification	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Sleep	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
include	
a	
criterion	CONCEPT
,	CONCEPT
or	
cri-	
teria	
,	
that	
connote	
clinical	RISKFACTOR
significance	RISKFACTOR

i.e.

,	
significant	
conse-	
quences	
,	
distress	
or	
impairment	RISKFACTOR
in	
one	
or	
more	
functional	
realms	
)	
.	

These	
criteria	CONCEPT
are	
particularly	
important	
because	
,	
without	
them	
,	
many	
phenomena	
related	
to	
sleep	
-	
wake	
do	
not	
rise	
to	
a	
level	
that

clinical	
attention

Users	
should	
also	
pay	
particular	
attention	
to	
the	
Notes	DOCUMENT
section	DOCUMENT
(	
where

)	
,	
as	
these	
notes	
provide	
essential	
definitions

the	
criteria	CONCEPT

Clinicians	
will	
note	
a	
number	
of	
significant	
content	
changes	
from	
the	
former	
edition	
.	

The	
most	
apparent	
of	
these	
is	
the	
collapse	
of	
all	
previous	
chronic	CONDITION

diagnoses	
into	
a

Relationship

Classification	
Systems	
Historically	
,	
there	
have	
been	
three	
major	
classifications	
systems	
for	
sleep	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
.	

Although	
the	
International	CONCEPT
Classification	CONCEPT
of	CONCEPT
Sleep	CONCEPT
Disorders	CONCEPT
system	
has	
,	
for	
many	
years	
,	
been	
the	
primary	
nosology	
for	
sleep	
medicine	
specialists	
,	
both	
the	
Diagnostic	DOCUMENT
and	DOCUMENT
Statistical	DOCUMENT
Manual	DOCUMENT
of	DOCUMENT
Mental	DOCUMENT
Disorders	DOCUMENT
(	
DSM	DOCUMENT
)	
of	
the	
American	
Psychiatric	
Association	
and	
the	
International	CONCEPT
Classification	CONCEPT

Diseases	CONCEPT
(	
ICD	
)	
nosology	
of	
the	
World	
Health	
Organization	
have	
also	
classified	
sleep	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
.	

Unfortunately	
,	
these	
competing	
systems	
have	
differed	
significantly	
in	
structure	
and	
content	
over	
the	
years	
.	

Development	
of	
DSM-5	DOCUMENT
was	
ongoing	
during	
the	
development	
of	
this	
manual	
and	
an	
effort	
was	
undertaken	
to	
achieve	
the	
greatest	
degree	
of	
concordance	
possible	
between	
these	
two	
systems	
,	
recognizing	
that	
the	
International	CONCEPT
Classification	CONCEPT
of	CONCEPT
Sleep	CONCEPT
Disorders	CONCEPT
will	
inevitably	
contain	
a	
greater	
level	
of	
detail	
than	
DSM	DOCUMENT

This	
goal	
was	
largely	
achieved	
although	
some	
differences	
will	
still	
exist	
.

major	
change

the	
Insomnia	SYMPTOM
section	
(	
i.e.	
establishment	
of	
a	
single

are	
significantly	
more	
detailed	
within

than

although	
the

are	
quite	
similar

Disorders	CONDITION
and

are	
likewise	
similar	
but	
with	
fewer

With

a	
major

within

was	
undertaken

in	
the

Both

favor	
of

feature

insomnia

a	
frequent	
and	
persistent	
difficulty	
initiating

maintaining	
sleep	
that	
results	
in	
general	
sleep

The

Complaints	
of	
early	
morning

typically	
entail	
the	
termination	
of	
sleep	
at

and	
a	
concomitant

the	
usual	
premorbid	
sleep	
pattern	
.	

The	
exact	
time	
at	
which	
early	
morning	
awakenings	
occur	
may	
vary	
con-	
siderably	
as	
a	
function	
of	
usual	
bedtimes

For	
example	
,	
a	
final	
awakening	
at	
4:00	
a.m.	
is	
likely	
to	
connote	
clinical	
significance	
when	
the	
usual	
bedtime	
is	
11:00	
p.m.	

but	
not	
when	
the	
usual	
bedtime	
occurs	
at	
9:00	
p.m.	

Symptoms	
during	
wakefulness	
accompany	
the	
sleep	
difficulties	
and	
result	
in	
the

Reports

As

proven

In

assigned

Given	
these

a

In

a

it

Given

Because

However	
,	
when	
sleep	
difficulties	
are	
persistent

underlying

be	
considered

as	
precipitating

per-	
petuating	
factors

may	
vary	
across	
the	
adult	
age	
range	
.	

These	
changes	
may	
in	
part	
reflect	
developmental	
changes	
across	
adulthood	
,	
such	
as	
the	
phase	
delay	
of	
endoge-	
nous	
circadian	
rhythms	
in

the

increased	
number

often	
seen	
even	
among	
healthy	
older	
adults

Epidemiological	
studies	
confirm	
that	
sleep	
onset

nonrestorative

are	
most

Precipitating

also	
change

Likewise	
,	
perpetuating	
factors	
may	
vary	
with	
the	
life	
circumstances	
of	
adults	
of	
different	
ages

One	
common	
example	
is	
the	
option	
of	
older	
adults	
to	
spend	
large	
amounts	
of	
time	
in

focused

These

Collectively	
these

This

Many	
patients	
with

underestimate	
the	
actual

In

This

may	
be	
related	
to

and	
may

In	
several

have	
longer

A	
minority

particularly	
older	
adults

insomnia	CONDITION
,	
have	
reduced	
mean	
MSLT	TEST

Such

finding	
should	
prompt	
consideration

Although	
PSG	TEST

MSLT	TEST

usually	
are	
not	
helpful	
in	
the	
establishment

there	
are	
circumstances

may	
warrant

Finally

during

The

is	
the

Essential	
Features	
The	
essential	
feature	
of	
short

term	
insomnia	
disorder	
is	
a	
short	
-	
term	
difficulty	
ini-	
tiating	
or	
maintaining	
sleep	
that	
results	
in	
general	
sleep	
dissatisfaction

The	
sleep	SYMPTOM
complaint	SYMPTOM
is	
accompanied	
by	
daytime	SYMPTOM
distress	SYMPTOM
about	SYMPTOM
poor	SYMPTOM

or	
impairment	
in	
family	
,	
social	
,	
occupational	
,	
academic

functioning

Furthermore	
,	
the	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
and	
associated	
daytime	SYMPTOM
symptoms	SYMPTOM
occur	
despite	
having	
adequate	
time	
and	
circumstances	
each	
night	
to	
obtain	
necessary	
sleep	
.	

Short-

In	
many	
cases

lasting	
less	
than	
three	
months	
,	
there	
is	
an	
identifiable	
cause	
that	
serves	
as	
the	
precipitant	
.	

In	
other	
cases	
,	
insomnia	
occurs	
episodically

often	
coincident	
to

for	
chronic	CONDITION
insomnia	CONDITION

,	
sleep	
complaints	
that

may	
include	
difficulties	
initiating

or	
difficulties

The	
latter	
complaint	
may	
include	
waking

Isolated	SYMPTOM

Normal	
Variants	
Excessive	
Time	
in	
Bed	

Some	
individuals	
may	
present	
with	
isolated	
insomnia	SYMPTOM
symptoms	SYMPTOM
such	
as	
prolonged	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
latencies	SYMPTOM
or	
long	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
during	
the	
night	
,	
yet	
not	
complain	
of	
insomnia	CONDITION
nor	
show	
daytime	
impairments	
.	

In	
children	
,	
this	
pattern	
may	
emerge	
when	
parents	
or	
caregivers	
have	
unrealistic	
expectations	
for	
the	
child	
’s	
sleep	
needs	
and	
rou-	
tinely	
allot	
too	
much	
time	
for	
the	
child	
to	
be	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
this	
pattern	
is	
perhaps	
most	
common	
in	
noncomplaining	
groups	
who	
routinely	
allot	
significantly	
more	
time	
in	
bed	
than	
needed	
for	
sleep	
.	

For	
example	
,	
some	
individuals	
who	
are	
retired	
from	
work	
or	
not	
currently	
employed	
may	
routinely	
spend	
excessive	
time	
in	
bed	
each	
night	
and	
are	
not	
bothered	
by	
the	
expanded	
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
they	
routinely	
experience	
.	

At	
present	
,	
epidemiological	
and	
laboratory	
studies	
are	
unable	
to	
ascertain	
whether	
adverse	
health	
outcomes	
are	
more	
strongly	
associated	
with	
perceived	
sleep	
difficulties	
/	
dissatisfaction	
or	
with	
particular	
objective	
indices	
of	
sleep	
duration	
,	
sleep	
latency	
,	
and	
sleep	
continuity

Short	CONDITION

Such	
individuals	
are	
considered	
to	
be

short	SYMPTOM
sleepers	SYMPTOM
if	
they	
have	
no	
complaints	
of	
sleep	
difficulties	
and	
show	
no	
obvious	
daytime	SYMPTOM
dysfunction	SYMPTOM
.	

Among	
these	
individuals	
,	
the	
observed	
relatively	
low	
average	
sleep	
time	
does	
not	
result	
from	
chronic	
volitional	
sleep	
restriction	
,	
as	
in	
the	
case	
of	
insufficient	
sleep	
syndrome	
,	
but	
rather	
indicates	
a	
constitutional	
disposition	
for	
reduced	
sleep	
requirement	
.	

The	
clinical	
significance	
of	
chronic	
short	SYMPTOM
sleep	SYMPTOM
duration	SYMPTOM
,	
and	
the	
identifi-	
cation	
of

,	
remain	
open

Various

with	
metabolic	
,	
cardiovascular	
,	
and	
other

However

these

are	
typically	
unable	
to

who	
have	
short	SYMPTOM

Short	SYMPTOM

At

,	
those	
who	
demonstrate	
less

should	
not

In

Depending

When

this

said	
to	
have	
UARS	CONDITION

Current	
data	
suggest	
that	
this

represents	
simply	
a

Demographics

Nevertheless	
,	
general	
population

studies	
from	
a	
number

indicate	
that

However	
,	
because

not

,	
the	
prevalence	
of	
the	
disease	
is

A

adulthood	
and

with	
a	
plateau	
reached	
after	
approximately	
age	
65	
years

Although	
OSA	CONDITION
occurs	
in	
the	
elderly	
,	
it	
is	
commonly	
observed	
with	
few	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
.	

In	
addition	
,	
some	
evidence	
suggests	
that	
risk

cardiovascular	CONDITION
disease	CONDITION
related	
to	
OSA	CONDITION

Pediatric	
OSA	CONDITION
is	
discussed	
in	
a	
separate	
section	
(	
below	
)	
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
underlying	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
during	
sleep	
is	
multifactorial	
.	

Patients	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
commonly	
have	
reduced	
cross	
-	
sectional	
area	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
lumen	
due	
to	
either	
excessive	
bulk	
of	
soft	
tissues	
(	
tongue	
,	
soft	
palate	
,	
and	
lateral	
pha-	
ryngeal	
walls	
)	
or	
craniofacial	
anatomy	
,	
or	
both	
.	

During	
inspiration	
,	
negative	
pressure	
is	
generated	
in	
the	
lumen	
of	
the	
upper	
airway	
,	
promoting	
closure	
.	

However	
,	
pharyngeal	
dilating	
muscles	
act	
to	
maintain	
patency	
.	

The	
activity	
of	
these	
muscles	
decreases	
with	
sleep	
onset	
,	
but	
is	
normally	
adequate	
to	
maintain	
an	
open	
airway	
.	

In	
persons	
with	
OSA	CONDITION

There	
is	
a	
further	
reduction	
in	
tone	
and	
phasic	
activity	
of	
pharyngeal	
dilating	
muscles	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
particularly	
in	
phasic	
REM	
,	
which	
likely	
contributes	
to	
apneas	CONDITION
and	
hypopneas	SYMPTOM
that	
are	
longer	
and	
more	
pronounced

upper

caliber

Smaller	
end

expiratory

may	
result	
in	
smaller	
upper	
airway	
size	
due	
to	
decreased	
downward	TEST
traction	TEST
(	
tracheal	
tug	
)	
.	

Some	
patients	
have	
unstable	
ventilatory	
control	
(	
high	
loop	
gain	
)	
with	
resulting	
periods	
of	
hypocapnia	SYMPTOM
that	
may	
also	
contribute	
to	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
.	

The	
mechanisms	
of	
apnea	CONDITION
/	
hypopnea	CONDITION

Some	
events	
may	
resolve	
with	
aug-	
mentation	
of	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
from	
chemical	
(	
low	
PaO2	TEST
,	
high	
PaCO2	TEST
)	
and	
mechanical	
(	
upper	
airway	
mechanoreceptors	
)	
stimuli	
,	
whereas	
others	
may	
depend	
on	
a	
change	
of	
sleep	
state	
(	
arousal	
)	
at	
either	
a	
cortical	
or	
subcortical	
level	
.	

Cortical	
arous-	
als	
are	
associated	
with	
changes	
detectable	
by	
EEG	TEST
,	
whereas	
other	
changes	
of	
state	
may	
be	
detectable	
only	
by	
direct	
or	
indirect	
measures	
of	
sympathetic	
tone	
.	

Even	
if	
arousals	
are	
not	
required	
for	
termination	
of	
all	
obstructive	
events	
,	
sleep	
fragmentation	
from	
arousals	
is	
nevertheless	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
significant	
cause	
of	
excessive	
daytime	
sleepiness	
.	

Apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
typically	
last	
considerably	
longer	
in	
REM	
and	
,	
in	
some	
patients	
,	
are	
only	
present	
in	
this	
sleep	
stage	
.	

The	
explanation	
for	
this	
finding	
is	
unknown	
.	

As	
an	
apnea	
or	
hypopnea	
event	
progresses	
,	
the	
patient	
gradually	
becomes	
more	
hypox-	
emic	
;	
the	
degree	
of	
oxygen	
desaturation	
is	
dependent	
not	
only	
on	
the	
duration	
of	
the	
event	
,	
but	
also	
on	
the	
patient	
’s	
baseline	
oxygen	
saturation	
and	
lung	
volume	
and	
the	
presence	
of	
comorbid	
lung	CONDITION
conditions	CONDITION
.	

Slight	
hypercarbia	SYMPTOM
also	
occurs	
during	
apneas	
and	
hypopneas	
and	
is	
worse	
during	
REM	
sleep

cardiovascular	CONDITION

Objective	
Findings	
Obstructive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
are	
documented	
by	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
with	
ongoing	
respiratory	
efforts	
during	
PSG	TEST
or	
an	
OCST	TEST
.	TEST

When	
breathing	
effort	
is	
recorded	
with	
respiratory	TEST
inductance	TEST
plethysmography	TEST
,	TEST
it	
typically	
shows	
paradoxical	
movement	
of	
the	
rib	
cage	
and	
abdomen	
.	

If	
esophageal	TEST
manometry	TEST
is	
used	
,	
increasingly	
large	
swings	
between	
inspiratory	
and	
expiratory	
efforts	
are	
observed	
.	
Obstructive	CONDITION
hypopneas	CONDITION
are	
a	
reduction	
rather	
than	
a	
cessation	
of	
airflow	
with	
ongoing	
respiratory	
effort	
.	

Increasing	
respira-	
tory	
effort	
with	
constant	
or	
reduced	
flow	
is	
indicative	
of	
increased	
upper	
airway	
resis-	
tance	
.	

This	
state	
is	
most	
accurately	
identified	
with	
a	
quantitative	
measurement	
of	
flow	
and	
esophageal	TEST
manometry	TEST
,	
although	
it	
can	
be	
inferred	
when	
there	
is	
obvious	
inspira-	
tory	
airflow	
limitation	
(	
flattening	
of	
the	
inspiratory	
flow	
)	
on	
a	
nasal	
pressure	
recording	
.	

Although	
patients	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
have	
predominantly	
obstructive	
events	
,	
they	
may	
also	
have	
variable	
amounts	
of	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
.	CONDITION

In	
some	
patients	
,	
these	
resolve	
with	
admin-	
istration	
of	
positive	TREATMENT
airway	TREATMENT
pressure	TREATMENT
,	
whereas	
in	
others	
frequent	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
either	
persist	
or	
emerge	
,	
at	
least	
during	
the	
initial	
night	
of	
positive	TREATMENT
airway	TREATMENT
pressure	TREATMENT
treatment	
.	

Oxygen	
saturation	
typically	
declines	
for	
a	
variable	
period	
of	
time	
following	
the	
onset	
of	
an	
event	
(	
apnea	CONDITION
or	
hypopnea	CONDITION
)	
,	
with	
the	
nadir	
usually	
occurring	
after	
normal	
breath-	
ing	
resumes	
.	

The	
degree	
of	
oxygen	
desaturation	
may	
range	
from	
as	
little	
as	
1	
%	
to	
2	
%	
,	
up	
to	
30	
%	
to	
40	
%	
or	
greater	
.	

If	
the	
baseline	
oxygen	
saturation	
is	
normal	
,	
there	
may	
be	
no	
discernible	
drop	
in	
oxygen	
saturation	
despite	
evidence	
of	
airflow	
limitation	
fol-	
lowed	
by	
arousal	
.	

As	
a	
result	
,	
some	
events	
associated	
with	
evidence	
of	
increased	
respi-	
ratory	
effort	
(	
and/or	
flattening	
of	
inspiratory	
flow	
)	
and	
an	
arousal	
at	
event	
termination	
may	
not	
meet	
diagnostic	
criteria	
for	
apnea	CONDITION
or	
hypopnea	CONDITION
.	

These	
events	
are	
defined	
as	
RERAs	CONCEPT
.	

These	
events	
are	
presumed	
to	
have	
the	
same	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
as	
obstructive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
and	
hypopneas	CONDITION
(	
upper	CONDITION
airway	CONDITION
obstruction	CONDITION

are	
considered	
to	
be

or	
both	
;	
however	
,	
the	
prevalence	
of	
this

in	
patients	
varies	
widely	
.	

At	
the	
time	
of

there	
is	
often	
a

in	
both	
sympathetic	
nervous	
system

Differential	
Diagnosis	

In	
contrast	
to	
patients	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
,	
those	
with	
isolated	CONDITION
snoring	CONDITION
will	
not	
exhibit	
obstruc-	CONDITION
tive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
,	
hypopneas	CONDITION
,	
or	
RERAs	CONDITION
on	
PSG	TEST
or	
OCST	TEST
and	
do	
not	
have	
other	
sleep	
symp-	
toms	
attributable	
to	
breathing	
disturbance	
.	

However	
,	
because	
arousal	
-	
based	
hypopneas	CONDITION
and	
RERAs	CONDITION
can	
not	
be	
identified	
with	
OCST	TEST
,	
OSA	CONDITION
can	
not	
be	
excluded	
if	
the	
OCST	TEST
is	
negative	
.	

Patients	
with	
central	CONDITION
sleep	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
have	
predominantly	
central	
rather	
than	
obstruc-	CONDITION
tive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
,	
hypopneas	CONDITION
,	
or	
RERAs	CONDITION
as	
the	
primary	
finding	
on	
PSG	TEST
or	
OCST	TEST
.	

If	
mixed	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
are	
predominant	
,	
a

.	
Snoring	SYMPTOM
may	
not	
be	
a	
prominent	
feature

although	
daytime	
sleepiness	
can	
occur	
.	

Patients

episodes

without	
evidence

obstruction	CONDITION
on	
PSG	TEST
or	
OCST	TEST
.	

Confirmation	
of	
nocturnal	
hypercapnia	
will	
be	
diagnostic	
.	

However	
,	
if	
obstructive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
or	
hypo-	CONDITION
pneas	CONDITION
are	
evident	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
OSA	CONDITION
should	
be	
made	
instead	
of	
,	
or	
in	
addition	
to	
,	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
sleep	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
hypoventilation	CONDITION
.	
OSA	CONDITION
must	
be	
differentiated	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
sleepiness	
such	
as	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
,	
idio-	CONDITION
pathic	CONDITION
hypersomnia	CONDITION
,	
and	
insufficient	
sleep	
.	

These	
conditions	
often	
can	
be	
identified	
on	
the	
basis	
of	
history	
,	
but	
PSG	TEST
and/or	
MSLT	TEST
may	
be	
required	
to	
confirm	
the	
diagnosis

OSA	CONDITION
should	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
causes	
of	
nocturnal	SYMPTOM

such	
as	
noc-	CONDITION
turnal	CONDITION
panic	CONDITION

,	
paroxysmal	CONDITION
nocturnal	CONDITION
dyspnea	CONDITION
from	
congestive	CONDITION
heart	CONDITION

and	
nocturnal	
angina	CONDITION

In	
many	
cases	
,	
absence	
of	
snoring	SYMPTOM
and	
daytime	SYMPTOM
sleepiness	SYMPTOM
will	
be	
highly	
suggestive	
of	
etiologies

However	
,	
the	
absence	
of	
obstructive	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
,	CONDITION
hypopneas	CONDITION
,	CONDITION
or	
RERAs	CONDITION
on	
PSG	TEST

definitively

the	
diagnosis

Children

which	
consists	
of	
long	
periods

Some

In	
children

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
In	
children	
,	
as	
in	
adults	
,	
OSA	CONDITION

During	
wakefulness	
,	
the	
patient	
with	
OSA	CONDITION
compensates	
by	
augmenting	
upper	
airway	
muscle	
tone	
to	
dilate	
the	
upper	
airway	
;	
thus	
,	
obstructive	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
does	
not	
occur	
.	

During	
sleep	
,	
there	
is	
a	
decrease	
in	
ventilatory	
drive	
and	
in	
neuromuscular	
tone	
,	
facilitating	
upper	
airway	
collapse	
.	

The	
resultant	
recurrent	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
,	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
,	
and	
sleep	SYMPTOM

may	
lead	
to	
neurobehavioral	
,	
cardiovascular

malities	SYMPTOM
.	

Childhood	
OSA	CONDITION
has	
also	
been	
associated	
with	
metabolic	
and	
inflammatory	
abnormalities	
.	

In	
most	
children	
who	
are	
otherwise	
healthy	
,	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
is	
primarily	
due	
to	
adenotonsillar	CONDITION
hypertrophy	CONDITION
.	

Pediatric	
OSA	CONDITION
also	
occurs	
in	
association	
with	
obesity	CONDITION
,	
which	
is	
becoming	
increasingly	
prevalent	
.	

Other	
causes	
for	
upper	
airway	
narrowing	
include	
craniofacial	CONDITION
anomalies	CONDITION
,	
particularly	
those	
involving	
midface	CONDITION
hypoplasia	CONDITION

can	
also	
occur	
during	
wakefulness

can	
be

As

apneas	CONDITION
and	
hypopneas	CONDITION
are	
associated

This	
breathing	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
tends	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
chronically	
low	
PaCO2	TEST
when	
awake	
and	
asleep	
.	
Hyperventilation	SYMPTOM
occurs	
due	
to	
an	
increase	
in	
the	
responsiveness	
of	
the	
periph-	
eral	
and	
central	
chemoreceptors	
.	

The	
increased	
responsiveness	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
due	
to	
both	
increased	
sympathetic	
tone	
and	
stimulation	
of	
vagal	
irritant	
receptors	
in	
the	
lungs	
by	
pulmonary	
congestion	
.	

The	
PaCO2	TEST
in	
individuals	
with	
CSB	CONDITION
pattern	
and	
heart	CONDITION
failure	CONDITION
is	
closer	
to	
their	
apneic	
threshold	
than	
in	
those	
without	
CSB	CONDITION
pattern	
(	
primarily	
due	
to	
a	
smaller	
sleep	
related	
rise	
in	
PaCO2	TEST
in	
those	
with	
CSB	CONDITION
)	
,	
so	
that	
even	
modest	
increases	
in	
ventilation	
can	
drive	
PaCO2	TEST
below	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

The	
most	
common	
trigger	
factor	
for	
central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
is	
an	
arousal	
from	
sleep	
,	
which	
abruptly	
augments	
ventilation	
and	
drives	
PaCO2	TEST

The	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
tidal	TEST
volume	TEST
results	
from	
prolonged	
lung	
-	
to	
-	
che-	
moreceptor	
circulatory	
delay	
,	
such	
that	
changes	
in	
PaCO2	TEST
in	
the	
lung	
are	
trans-	
mitted	
only	
very	
slowly	
to	
the	
chemoreceptors	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
gradual	
buildup	
and	
falloff	
of	
ventilatory	TREATMENT
stimulation	TREATMENT
.	TREATMENT

The	
length	
of	
the	
cycle	
is	
directly	
proportional	
to	
lung	
-	
to	
-	
chemoreceptor	
circulation	
time	
and	
inversely	
proportional	
to	
cardiac	
output	
.	

Accordingly	
,	
whereas	
the	
length	
of	
the	
ventilatory	
-	
apneic	
cycle	
in	
primary	
CSA	
is	
typically	
shorter	
than	
40	
seconds	
,	
in	
CSB	
pattern	
it	
is	
almost	
invariably	
longer	
than	
40	
seconds	
(	
usually	
45	
-	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

One	
study	
of	
patients	
with	
varying	
degrees	
of	
heart	CONDITION
failure	CONDITION
found	
a	
considerably	
shorter	
cycle	
time

patients	
with	
normal

tion

e.g.

the	
setting

However	
,	
apneas	CONDITION

to

Predisposing

The	
only	
known	
predisposing	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
high

altitude	
periodic	SYMPTOM
breathing	SYMPTOM
is	
increased	
ventilatory	TEST
chemoresponsiveness	TEST
,	
primarily	
hypoxic	
ventila-	
tory	
responsiveness

A	
high	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
will	
lead	
to	
increased	
hyper-	SYMPTOM
ventilation	SYMPTOM
on	
ascent	RISKFACTOR
to	RISKFACTOR
altitude	RISKFACTOR
.	

This	
hyperventilation	SYMPTOM
leads	
to	
hypocapnic	CONDITION
alkalosis	CONDITION
that	
,	
during	
sleep	
,	
inhibits	
ventilation	
.	

Thus	
,	
repetitive	
cycles	
of	
apnea	CONDITION
and	
hyperpnea	SYMPTOM
develop	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
.	

The	
obvious	
precipitating	
factor	
for	
the	
development	
of	
this	
periodic	SYMPTOM
breathing	SYMPTOM
is	
ascent	RISKFACTOR

Some

Because

variable	
in	
the	
development

it	
would	
seem

there	
would	
be	
a	
familial	
pattern	
in	
the	
development	
of	
this	
respiratory	SYMPTOM
abnormality	SYMPTOM

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
hypoxia	
itself	
may	
have	
an	
important	
role	
in	
disturbing	
sleep	
architecture	
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
and	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
may	
improve	
during	
acclimatization	
to	
altitude	
even	
if	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic

actually	
increases

The	
complications	
of	
high	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
,	
which	
are	
generally	
limited	
to	
disrupted	
sleep

include	
frequent	
awakenings

a

may	
lead	
to

In

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
High	
-	
altitude	
periodic	
breathing	
is	
believed	
to	
be	
a	
product	
of	
the	
hyperventilation	SYMPTOM
induced	
by	
the	
hypobaric	CONDITION
hypoxia	CONDITION
encountered	
at	
altitude	
.	

At	
2,500	
meters	
the	
atmo-	
spheric	
pressure	
is	
approximately	
570	
mm	
Hg	
and	
the	
ideal	
alveolar	TEST
PO2	TEST
around	
55	
mm	
Hg	
(	
depending	
on	
the	
level	
of	
PaCO2	TEST
)	
.	

Actual	
arterial	TEST
PO2	TEST
values	
will	
be	
lower	
,	
especially	
during	
sleep	
.	

The	
hypoxic	
ventilatory	
response	
shows	
a	
steep	
increase	
in	
ventilation	
when	
the	
arterial	TEST
PO2	TEST
level	
drops	
below	
55	
mm	
Hg	
.	

The	
increases	
in	
venti-	
lation	
associated	
with	
hypoxemia	CONDITION
result	
in	
hypocapnic	CONDITION
alkalosis	CONDITION
.	CONDITION

Because	
PaCO2	TEST
is	
the	
principal	
stimulus	
to	
respiration	
during	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
a	
low	
PaCO2	TEST
can	
yield	
a	
loss	
or	
reduction	
in	
respiratory	
drive	
,	
resulting	
in	
central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
or	
hypopnea	CONDITION
.	CONDITION

The	
greater	
the	
ventilatory	
response	
to	
hypoxia	CONDITION
,	
the	
greater	
the	
fall	
in	
PaCO2	TEST
.	

Thus	
,	
individuals	
with	
brisk	
hypoxic	
responses	
more	
commonly	
tend	
to	
demonstrate	
this	
respiratory	
pattern	
.	

Over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
apnea	CONDITION
,	
the	
PaO2	TEST
falls	
and	
PaCO2	TEST
rises	
,	
eventually	
stimulating	
a	
resumption	
of	
ventilation	
.	

However	
,	
after	
several	
large	
breaths	
,	
the	
PaCO2	TEST
again	
falls	
below	
the	
apnea	CONDITION
threshold	
,	
initiating	
another	
pause	
in	
breathing	
.	

This	
cycle	
is	
then	
repeated	
over	
the	
course	
of	
the	
night	
.	

Of	
note	
,	
the	
respiratory	
pattern	
is	
often	
improved	
during	
REM	
sleep	
with	
reduced	
cycling	
.	

This	
is	
likely	
due	
to	
the	
decreased	
hypoxic	CONDITION
and	
hypercapnic	
responsiveness	
characteristic	
of	
REM	
sleep	
.	

Of

due	
to	
a	
lowering	
of	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

Other	
studies	
have	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
continues	
to	
increase	
over	
three	
days	
to	
two	
weeks	
of	
acclimatization	
despite	
improvements	
in	
oxygen	TEST
saturation	TEST
.	

The	
increase	
in	
both	
periodic	
breathing	
and	
oxygen	TEST
saturation	TEST
is	
thought	
to	
be	
due	
to	
increased	
controller	
gain	
of	
the	
respiratory	
system	
.	

A	
number	
of	
studies	
have	
found	
that	
the	
impairment	
of

architecture	
does	
not	
correlate	
with	
the	
degree	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
.	

One	
study	
found	
that	
the	
amount	
of	
periodic	
breathing	
was	
greater	
on	
the	
third	
night	
at

both

The

In

the

The

This	
breathing	
pattern	
occurs	
only	
during	
NREM

with	
more

Because	
this

is	
a	
physiologic	
adaptation	
to	
altitude	
,	
there	
is	
no	
specific	
number	
of	
apneas	
per

to	
be	
a	
major	
predisposing	RISKFACTOR

in	
the

This	
can	
lead	
to	
the	
instability	
in

latory	
control	
that	
characterizes	
the	
disorder

Frequent	
arousal

can	
also	
predispose	
to	
the	
development

somewhat

Increased

can	
result	
in	
a	
PaCO2	TEST

the

their

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Primary	
CSA	CONDITION
is	
caused	
by	
instability	
of	
the	
respiratory	
control	
system	
in	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
and	
less	
commonly	
during	
stable	
NREM	
sleep	
.	
Central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
in	
patients	
with	
primary	
CSA	CONDITION
most	
often	
occurs	
during	
stages	
N1	
and	
N2	
sleep	
and	
is	
rare	
during	
stages	

N3	
and	
R	
sleep	
.	
Central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
tend	
to	
occur	
in	
individuals	
with	
a	
high	
or	
increased	
ventilatory	
responsiveness	
to	
CO2	
.	
Arterial	TEST
PCO2	TEST
levels	
below	
the	
hypocapnic	
apnea	
threshold	
lead	
to	
a	
cessation	
in	
ventilatory	
effort	
and	
,	
therefore	
,	
a	
central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION

Individuals	
with	
high	
CO2	
ventilatory	
responsiveness	
tend	
to	
have	
lower	
PaCO2	TEST
levels	
(	
both	
daytime	
and	
sleep	
)	
and	
a	
lower	
gradient	
between	
the	
sleep-	
ing	
PaCO2	TEST
and	
the	
apneic	
threshold	
.	

Hence	
,	
a	
smaller	
increase	
in	
ventilation	
is	
required	
to	
reach	
this	
apnea	
threshold	
and	
inhibit	
ventilation	
.	

Individuals	
with	
high	
chemore-	
sponsiveness	
also	
hyperventilate	SYMPTOM
more	
in	
response	
to	
small	
changes	
in	
arterial	
PaCO2	TEST
.	

This	
again	
often	
drives	
the	
PaCO2	TEST
below	
the	
apnea	
threshold	
,	
yielding	
a	
cessation

However	
,	
not	
all	
factors	
that	
cause

ventilatory	
drive	
have	
the	
same	
effect	
.	

Studies	
suggest	
that	
although	
hypoxemia	CONDITION
increases	
chemoresponsiveness	
to	
PaCO2	TEST
,	
the	
gap	
between	
the	
PaCO2	TEST

is	
smaller

However	
,	
once

these

Normal	
individuals	
should	
not	
have	
more	
than	
five	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
per	
hour	
of	
sleep	
.	

Primary	
CSA	CONDITION
must	
be	
distinguished	
from	
other	
sleep	
related	
breathing	
disorders	
.	

Some	
patients	
with	
predominantly	
OSA	CONDITION
will	
have	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
during	
diagnostic	TEST
or	
positive	TEST
airway	TEST

These	
apneas	
tend	
to

over

The	
pattern	
of	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
in	
primary	
CSA	CONDITION
differs	
from	
that	
of	
CSA	CONDITION
with	
CSB	CONDITION
.	

Primary	
CSA	CONDITION
lacks	
the	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
of	
respiration	
between	
contiguous	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
noted	
in	
patients	
with	
CSA	CONDITION
with	
CSB	CONDITION
.	

The	
cycle	
length	
is	
longer	
in	
CSB	CONDITION
(	
greater	
than	
40	
seconds	
and	
typically	
45	
to	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

The	
longer	
cycle	
length	
in	
CSB	CONDITION
versus	
primary	
CSA	CONDITION
is	
due	
to	
a	
longer	
respiratory	
phase	
between	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION

In	
primary	CONDITION
CSA	CONDITION
,	
the	
apnea	
is	
often	
terminated	
abruptly	
by	
a	
large	
breath	
,	
and	
there	
are	
usually	
no	
more	
that	
4	
to	
5	
breaths	
between	
apneas	
.	

Furthermore	
,	
most	
patients	
with	
Cheyne	CONDITION
-	CONDITION
Stokes	CONDITION
respiration	CONDITION
will	
have	
a	
history	
of	
congestive	CONDITION
heart	CONDITION
failure	CONDITION
or	
a	
neurological	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
.	

Patients	
with	
central	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
due	
to	
substance	
use	
,	
particularly	
potent	
long	
-	
acting	
narcotics	
,	
may	
exhibit	
periodic	
breathing	
with	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
,	
but	
the	
pattern	
of	
ventilation	
between	
apneas	
does	
not	
have	
a	
crescendo	
-	
decrescendo	
pattern	
and	
the	
cycle	
length	
is	
shorter	
than	
40	
seconds	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
underlying	
pattern	
of	
breathing	
is	
often	
ataxic	
(	
irregular	
varia-	
tions	
in	
cycle	
length	
and	
tidal	TEST
volume	TEST
)	
and	
a	
low	
respiratory	
rate	
may	
be	
noted	
.	

Unlike	
primary	CONDITION
CSA	CONDITION
,	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
can	
occur	
during	
stage	
N3	
in	
patients	
taking	
opioids

Patients	
with	
CSA	CONDITION
due	
to	
medical	
or	
neurological	
conditions	
not	
of	
the	
Cheyne	
-	
Stokes	
pattern	
often	
have	
a	
history	
of	
a	
known	
neurological	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
(	
recent	
cerebrovascular	CONDITION
accident	CONDITION
)	
but	
in	
others	
a	
high	
index	
of	
suspicion	
for	
an	
underlying	
disorder	
is	
indi-	
cated	
.	

For	
example	
,	
patients	
with	
Chiari	CONDITION
malformation	CONDITION
may	
present	
in	
adulthood	
with	
unexplained	
central	CONDITION
apneas	CONDITION
and	
relatively	
few	
other	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
.	

Thus	
,	
primary	
CSA	CONDITION
is	
a	
diagnosis	
based	
on	
careful	
exclusion	
of	
other	
causes	
of	
CSA	CONDITION

In

the	
onset	
or

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
etiology	
of	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
is	
not	
completely	
understood	
.	

Although	
comorbid	
OSA	CONDITION
is	
common	
,	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
and	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM

The	
importance	
of	
various	
factors	
leading	
to	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
likely	
varies	
among	
patients	
.	

It	
has	
been	
postulated	
that	
sustained	
nocturnal	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
results	
from	
the	
development	
of	
short	
(	
due	
to	
apnea	CONDITION
-	CONDITION
hypopnea	CONDITION
)	
or	
longer	
(	
secondary	
to	
hypoven-	
tilation	
)	
periods	
of	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
accompanied	
by	
inadequate	
compensation	
(	
i.e.	
,	
CO2	
unloading	
)	
during	
periods	
of	
ventilation	
between	
obstructive	
events	
.	

Abnormal	
venti-	
latory	
control	
(	
blunted	
hypercapnic	SYMPTOM
ventilatory	
response	
)	
allows	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
to	
persist	
into	
wakefulness	
after	
the	
cause	
of	
acute	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
is	
no	
longer	
present	
.	

A	
chronic	
hypercapnic	SYMPTOM
state	SYMPTOM
would

syndrome	CONDITION
(	
CCHS	CONDITION

is	
a	
syndrome	
of	
auto-

dysfunction	
,	
primarily	
the	
failure	
of

,	
due	
to	
a

Some	
infants	
may	
appear	
to

of	
reduced	
tidal	
volume	
or

Although

cause

a	
diagnosis	
of	
both

made

Arterial

Hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
worsens

Essential	
Features	

This	
disorder	
is	
characterized	
primarily	
by	
chronic	
hypoventilation	
and	
hypercapnia	
due	
to	
prolonged	
use	
of	
medications	
or	
substances	
known	
to	
depress	
ventilatory	
drive	
and/or	
impair	
respiratory	
muscle	
mechanics	
.	

These	
agents	
include	
long	
-	
acting	
nar-	
cotics	
,	
anesthetics	
,	
sedative	
compounds	
,	
and	
muscle	
relaxants

Pathology

Pathophysiology	
Pulmonary	CONDITION
parenchymal	CONDITION

are	
characterized	
by	
altered	
lung	
volumes	
(	
e.g.	
,	
reduced	
functional	
residual	
capacity

and	
abnormal	
ventilation

relationships

which	
can	
result	
in	
hypercapnia	SYMPTOM
and	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
during	
wakefulness	
.	

Decreased	
lung	
volume	
is	
associated	
with	
reduced	
oxygen	
reserves	
that	
increase	
the	
risk	
of	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
.	

In	
addition	
,	
sleep	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
altered	
pattern	
of	
ventilatory	
-	
muscle	
acti-	
vation	
,	
particularly	
during	
REM	
sleep	
when	
,	
due	
to	
reduced	
activation	
of	
the	
intercos-	
tal	
and	
accessory	
muscles	
,	
there	
is	
a	
disproportionate	
ventilatory	
burden	
placed	
on	
the	
diaphragm	
.	

This	
may	
lead	
to	
hypoventilation	SYMPTOM
in	
patients	
with	
chest	CONDITION
wall	CONDITION
abnormalities	CONDITION
or	
in	
those	
with	
chronic	CONDITION
obstructive	CONDITION
pulmonary	CONDITION

In	
the	
latter	
,	
lung	CONDITION
hyperinfla-	CONDITION
tion	CONDITION
creates	
a	
mechanical	
disadvantage	
to	
the	
diaphragm

Many	
neurologic	CONDITION
and	
neu-	CONDITION
romuscular	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
are	
associated	
with	
impaired	
respiratory

reduced	
CO2	
chemosensitivity

Finally	
,	
daytime	
hypoxemia	SYMPTOM
,	
if	
sufficiently	
severe

may

the

Snoring	SYMPTOM
is	
a	
respiratory	
sound	
generated	
in	
the	
upper	
airway	
during	
sleep	
that	
typically	
occurs	
during	
inspiration	
but	
may	
also	
occur	
in	
expiration	
;	
the	
snoring	SYMPTOM
described	
here	
occurs	
without	
episodes	
of	
apnea	CONDITION
,	
hypopnea	CONDITION
,	
RERAs	CONDITION
or	
hypoventilation	CONDITION
.	

The	
intensity	
of	
snoring	SYMPTOM
may	
vary	
and	
often	
will	
disturb	
the	
bed	
partner	
’s	
sleep	
and	
even	
awaken	
the	
patient	
.	
Snoring	SYMPTOM
in	
this	
context	
does	
not	
cause	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
of	
daytime	
sleepiness	
or	
insomnia	CONDITION
in	
the	
patient	
.	

This	
type	
of	
snoring	SYMPTOM
has	
variously	
been	
referred	
to	
as	
habitual	
,	
primary	
or	
simple	
snoring	SYMPTOM
.	
Snoring	SYMPTOM
is	
a	
cardinal	
symptom	SYMPTOM
of	
obstructive	CONDITION
sleep	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION

A	
designation	
of	
habitual	CONDITION
snoring	CONDITION
can	
not	
be	
made	
in	
those	
who	
exhibit	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
(	
daytime	SYMPTOM
sleepiness	SYMPTOM
/	
fatigue	SYMPTOM
or	
other	
related	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
)	
or	
report	
possible	
breathing	
pauses	
,	
without	
objective	
mea-	
surement	
of	
breathing	
during	
sleep	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
those	
individuals	
with	
snoring	
and	
comorbid	
cardiovascular	CONDITION

(	
especially	
pulmonary	CONDITION
or	
systemic	CONDITION
hypertension	CONDITION
,	
cor-	CONDITION

atrial	CONDITION

)	
are	
at	
increased

the	
presence	
of	
OSA	CONDITION
even	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
complaints	
of	
daytime	SYMPTOM
sleepiness	SYMPTOM
.	

Therefore	
,	
PSG	TEST
or	
OCST	TEST
is	
required	
in	
order	
to	
effectively	
rule	
out	
OSA	CONDITION
in	
such	
populations	
.	

It	
should	
also	
be	
noted	
that	
patients	
who	
initially	
have	
isolated	
snoring	SYMPTOM
may	
be	
at	
risk	
for	
developing	
OSA	CONDITION
with	
aging	
or	
weight	
gain	
.	

Occasional	
snoring	SYMPTOM
is	
almost	
universal	
.	

Estimates	
on	
snoring	SYMPTOM
vary	
widely	
depending	
on	
its	
definition	
.	

The	
incidence	
of	
snoring	SYMPTOM
in	
children	
is	
reported	
to	
be	
10	
%	
to	
12	
%

This	
section	
includes	
a	
group	
of	
disorders	
in	
which	
the	
primary	
complaint	
is	
daytime	
sleepiness	
not	
caused	
by	
disturbed	
nocturnal	
sleep	
or	
misaligned	
circadian

Other

may	
be	
present

but	
they	
must	
be	
adequately	
treated	
before	
a	
diagnosis	
in	
this	
category	
can	
be	
established	
.	

In	
this	
nosology	CONCEPT
,	
the	
term	
hypersomnolence	SYMPTOM
is	
used	
to	
describe	
the	
symptom	SYMPTOM
of	
exces-	
sive	
sleepiness	
,	
whereas	
hypersomnia	CONDITION
refers	
to	
specific	
disorders	
,	
such	
as	
idiopathic	CONDITION
hypersomnia	CONDITION

Daytime	CONDITION
sleepiness	CONDITION
is	
defined	
as	
the	
inability	
to	
stay	
awake	
and	
alert	
during	
the	
major	
waking	
episodes	
of	
the	
day	
,	
resulting	
in	
periods	
of	
irrepressible	
need	
for	
sleep	
or	
unin-	
tended	
lapses	
into	
drowsiness	
or	
sleep	
.	

Sleepiness	
may	
vary	
in	
severity	
and	
is	
more	
likely	
to	
occur	
in	
sedentary	
,	
boring	
,	
and	
monotonous	
situations	
that	
require	
little	
active	
participation	
.	

Some	
patients	
are	
aware	
of	
increasing	
sleepiness	
before	
falling	
asleep	
,	
whereas	
others	
can	
fall	
asleep	
with	
little	
or	
no	
prodromal	SYMPTOM
symptoms	SYMPTOM
(

attrib-	
utable	
to

In	
some	
forms	
of	
hypersomnolence	CONDITION
,	
sleepiness	
is	
associated	
with	
large	
increases	
in	
total	
daily	
amount	
of	
sleep	
without	
any	
genuine	
feeling	
of	
resto-	
ration	
.	

In	
others	
,	
sleepiness	
can	
be	
alleviated	
temporarily	
by	
naps	
but	
reoccurs	
shortly	
thereafter	
.	

In	
young	
children	
,	
sleepiness	
may	
express	
itself	
as	
excessively	
long	
night	
sleep	
or	
with	
the	
recurrence	
of	
previously	
discontinued

the

been	
changed

In

been	
divided	
into	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
1	CONDITION
and	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
2	CONDITION
rather	
than	
narcolepsy	CONDITION

This	
change	
is	
predicated	
on	
the	
concept	
that	
absence	
of	
hypocretin	
(	
orexin	
)	
is	
a	
fundamental	
marker	
of	
the	
most	
precisely	
defined	
category	
of	
the	
disorder

Because	
some	
patients	
without	
cataplexy	CONDITION
will	
also	
have	
low	
cerebrospinal	
fluid	
(	
CSF	
)	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
,	
the	
use	
of	
the	
term	
“	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
with	CONDITION
cataplexy	CONDITION
”	
or	
“	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
-	CONDITION
cataplexy	CONDITION
”	
is	
inappropriate	
.	

The	
change	
is	
not	
intended	
to	
imply	
that	
the	
presence	
or	
absence	
of	
cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
unimportant	
clinically	
nor	
that	
mea-	
suring	
CSF	
hypocretin-1	
levels	
is	
obligatory	
.	

The	
motivation	
behind	
the	
decision	
to	
eliminate	
the	
subcategories	
of	
idiopathic	CONDITION
hypersomnia	CONDITION
is	
discussed	
in	
the	
appropriate

use	
Kleine	CONDITION
-	CONDITION
Levin	CONDITION
syndrome	CONDITION
as	
the	
preferred	
name	
in	
place	
of	
recurrent	CONDITION
hypersomnia	CONDITION
is	
based	
on	
data	
suggesting	
that	
the	
condition	
is	
fairly	
homo-	
geneous	
,	
as	
well	
as	
the	
lack	
of	
definite	
evidence

other	
major	
subcategories

Even	
when	
seemingly

many

have	
lapses	
in

sometimes	
in	
combination	
with	
automatic

as	
writing	
gibberish	
or	
interrupting	
a

Sleepiness	SYMPTOM
generally	
has	
a	
serious	
impact	
on	
the	
ability	
of	
the	
patient	
to	
function	
in	
educational	
,	
social	
,	
and	
occupational	
situations	
.	

Because	
patients	
are	
rarely	
examined	
during	
an	
attack	
of	
cataplexy	CONDITION
,	
its	
presence	
needs	
to	
be	
established	
based	
on	
the	
clinical	TEST
interview	TEST
alone	
.	
Cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
defined	
as	
more	
than	
one	
episode	
of	
generally	
brief	
(	
<	
2	
minutes	
)	
,	
usually	
bilaterally	
symmetrical	
sudden	
loss	
of	
muscle	
tone	
with	
retained	
consciousness	
.	

The	
episodes	
are	
precipitated	
by	
strong	
emotions	
,	
usually	
positive	
,	
with	
almost	
all	
patients	
reporting	
some	
episodes	
precipitated	
by	
emotions	
associated	
with	
laughter	
.	

The	
finding	
of	
transient	
reversible	
loss	
of	
deep	
tendon	
reflexes	
during	
an	
attack	
,	
if	
observed	
,	
is	
a	
strong	
diagnostic	
finding	
.	

In	
children	
(	
and	
rarely	
adults	
)	
,	
cataplexy	CONDITION
may	
present	
close	
to	
disease	
onset	
as	
facial	
(	
or	
generalized	
)	
hypotonia	
with	
droopy	SYMPTOM
eyelids	SYMPTOM
,	
mouth	SYMPTOM
opening	SYMPTOM

and	
protruded	SYMPTOM
tongue	SYMPTOM
,	
or	
gait	SYMPTOM
unsteadiness	SYMPTOM

In	
children	
,	
anticipation	
of	
a	
reward	
is	
a	
common	
precipitant	
.	

It	
is	
important	
to	
use	
child	
-	
appropriate	
contexts	
and	
language	
when	
trying	
to	
elicit	
a	
history	
of	
cataplexy	CONDITION
in	
children	
.	

The	
cataplexy	CONDITION
phenotype	
differs	
widely	
between	
patients	
,	
ranging	
from	
sporadic	
partial	
attacks	
triggered	
by	
laughter	
,	
to	
frequent	
complete	
attacks	
of	
collapse	
brought	
about	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
emotions	
.	

In	
the	
vast	
majority	
of	
attacks	
,	
cataplexy	CONDITION
is	
bilateral	
,	
although	
patients	
sometimes	
report	
one	
side	
of	
the	
body	
to	
be	
more	
affected	
than	
the	
other	
.	

Partial	
attacks	
can	
be	
very	
subtle	
and	
sometimes	
only	
recognized	
by	
experi-	
enced	
observers	
such	
as	
the	
patient	
’s	
partner

Neck	SYMPTOM

Although

potentially	
lead

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
It	
is	
now	
firmly	
established	
that	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
1	CONDITION
is	
caused	
by	
deficiencies	
in	
hypo-	
cretin	
signaling	
,	
most	
likely	
due	
to	
a	
selective	
loss	
of	
hypothalamic	
hypocretin	
pro-	
ducing	
neurons

have	
undetectable

(	
<

levels

The	
strong	
HLA	
association	
in	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
has	
led	
to	
the	
hypothesis	
that	
auto-	
immunity	
is	
a	
likely	
etiological	
mechanism	
,	
potentially	
explaining	
the	
selectivity	
of	
neuronal	
destruction

However

Findings	
Narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION

is	
essentially	
defined	
as	
a

the	
fact

In	
patients	
with	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
,	
the	
MSLT	TEST
demonstrates	
a	
mean	
sleep	
latency	
of	
less	
than	
eight	
minutes	
and	
typically	
less	
than	
five	
minutes	
.	

Meta	
-	
analysis	
shows	
mean	
sleep	
latencies	
in	
narcoleptic	
patients	
with	
cataplexy	
of	
3.1	
±	
2.9	
minutes	
.	

In	
addition	
,	
two	
or	
more	
SOREMPs	
must	
be	
present	
.	

Recent	
data	
suggest	
that	
a	
SOREMP	
within	
15	
minutes	
of	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
is	
a	
highly	
specific	
finding	
in	
the	
absence	
of	
another	
sleep	
disorder	
,	
but	
with	
low	
sensitivity	
.	

Therefore	
,	
the	
criteria	
for	
narcolepsy	
type	
1	
allow	
the	
“	
replacement	
”	
of	
one	
SOREMP	
in	
the	
MSLT	TEST
with	
a	
SOREMP	
on	
the	
preceding	
poly-	
somnogram

For	
the	
correct	
interpretation	
of

findings	
,	
the	
recordings	
should	
be	
performed	
with	
the	
following

the

Objective

It

strongly

be	
preceded	
by	
at	
least	
one	
week	
of	
acti-

The

strates	
a	
mean

five

Recent	
data	
suggest	
that	
a	
SOREMP	TREATMENT
within	
15	
minutes	
of	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
sleep	
is	
a	
highly	
specific	
finding

the	
absence

with	
low	
sensitivity

Therefore	
,	
the	
criteria

allow	
the	
“	
replacement

one

the

Many

Nevertheless

differentiation

be	
difficult	
in

somewhat	
higher	
in

The	
correct	
determination	
is	
often	
made	
by	
exclusion

the

are

biological	
rhythms	
that	
exist	
in	
all	
living

The	
internal

is	
entrained	
or	
synchro-	
nized	
to	
the	
24

cycle	
.	

In	
humans	
,	
the	
endogenous	
period	
of	
the	
circa-	
dian	
oscillation	
is	
genetically	
determined	
and	
typically	
is	
slightly	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

In	
order	
to	
maintain	
entrainment	
,	
the	
endogenous	
rhythm	
must	
be	
reset	
each	
day	
to	
the	
24

hour	
clock	
time

Therefore	
,	
a	
recurrent

pattern

sleep

disturbance	
may	
result	
from	
disruption	
of	
the

or	
a	
misalignment	
between	
the

As	
used

a

disorder	
(

is	
defined	
by	
the

a

Most	
CRSWDs	CONDITION
arise	
when

the

of	
the	
patient

Therefore	
,	
measurement

is	
important	
for	
the	
accu-

multiple	
tools	
are

Sleep	
log

are	
essential	
instruments	
in	
the	
evaluation

should	
be

Given	
a	
sufficient	
discrepancy	
between	
early	
and	
late	
wake	
times	
,	
early	
wake	
times	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
bright	
light	
exposure	
during	
the	
maximal	
phase	
delay	
region	
,	
perpetuating	
the	
cir-	
cadian	
phase

.	

Individuals	
may	
have	
alterations	
in	
sensitivity	
to	
the	
phase

effects	
of	
light

For	
example

partial

can	
also	
attenuate	
the

In	
some	
cases	
,	
children	
are	
motivated	
to	
wake	
up	
earlier	
than	
desired	
because	
they	
are	
reinforced	
for	
this

by

attention

the	
opportunity	
to	
watch

The	
com-

that	
a	
child	
“	
falls	
asleep	
too	
early	
”	
in	
the	
evening	
,	
especially	
in

a

Hypophosphorylation

Unresolved

Directions	

The	
existing	
literature	DOCUMENT
suggests	
that	
clinicians	
are	
unlikely	
to	
encounter	
patients	
with	
stringently	
defined	
ASWPD	
.	

Until	
the	
identification	
of	
familial	
cohorts	
,	
only	
four	
cases	
were	
described	
.	

Various	
treatment	TREATMENT
trials	
also	
support	
this	
contention	
with	
demon-	
stration	
of	
objectively	
conventional	
sleep	
and	
wake	
times	
despite	
study	
entry	
based	
on	
subjective	
reports

The	
absence	
of	
the	
early	
evening	
sleepiness	
complaint	
may	
be	
due	
to	
the	
fact	
that	
the	
timing

can	
be	
more	
readily	
modified	
than	
wake	
time	
,	
and	
is	
likely	
to	
be

These

may	
complain	
that	
their	
child	
sleeps

much	
or	
too	
little	
or	
at

The	
key	
characteristics	
that	
distinguish	
N24SWD	
from	
other	
sleep	
complaints	
or	
circadian	
sleep	
wake	
dis-	
orders	
are	
twofold	
:	
(	
1	
)	
the	
predictable	
pattern	
of	
misalignment	
between	
the	
child	
’s	
sleep	
patterns	
and	
the	
light	
-	
dark

-	
hour	
cycle	
(	
progressive

)	
;	
and	
(

)	
periods	
of	
apparent	
“

remission	
”	
during	
those	
transient	
intervals	
when	
the	
child	
’s	
circadian	
sleep	
-	
wake	
propensity	
coincides	
with	
the	
desired	
bed	
and	
wake	
times	
.	

The	
impact	
on	
caregivers	
’	
sleep	
and	
daytime	
functioning	
is	
often	
profound	
.	

Although	
N24SWD	
is	
extremely	
rare	
in	
typically	
developing	
or	
sighted	
children	
,	
it	
has	
been	
reported	
with	
some	
frequency	
in	
children	
with	
intellectual	
disabilities	
and	
blindness	
.	

For	
example	
,	
children	
with	
optic	CONDITION
nerve	CONDITION
hypoplasia	CONDITION
due	
to	
a	
variety	
of	
under-	
lying	
causes	
,	
especially	
those	
children	
with	
hypoplastic	CONDITION
corpus	CONDITION
callosum	CONDITION
and	
comor-	
bid	
severe	
intellectual	
and	
visual	
impairments	
,	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
have	
features	
of	
N24SWD	
.	
N24SWD	
has	
also	
been	
described	
in	
pediatric	
patients	
with	
Rett	
syndrome	
(	
a	
genetic	
disorder	
occurring	
almost	
exclusively	
in	
girls	
,	
characterized	
by	
severe	
developmental	
regression	
,	
language	
delays	
,	
and	
limited	
social	
interactions	
)	
,	
autism	
spectrum	
disorders	
,	
and	
Angelman	
syndrome	
,	
a	
neurodevelopmental	
disorder	
asso-	
ciated	
with	
an	
abnormality	
of	
chromosome	
15q11	
-	
q13	
.	

The	
common	
mechanism	
in	
all	
of	
these	
disorders	
is	
postulated	
to	
be	
lack	
of	
entrainment	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
that	
results	
from	
the	
failure	
to	
perceive	
and/or	
attend	
to	
social	
/	
environmental	
zeitgebers	
(	
time	
cues	
)	
.	

There	
have	
also	
been	
several	
case	
reports	
which	
describe	
the	
emergence	
of	
N24SWD	
in	
intellectually	
normal	
sighted	
children	
or	
adolescents	
who	
have	
limited	
or	
inappropriate	
exposure	
to	
environmental	
and	
other	
entraining	
cues	
(	
e.g.

light

the	
day	
and/or	
excessive

exposure	
in

evening	
)	
.	

These	
individuals	
are	
likely	
to	
have	
significant	
psychiatric	
impairments	
that	
predispose	
them	
to	
avoid-	
ance	
of	
social	
interactions	
(	
e.g.

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
intrinsic	
period	
of	
the	
human	
circadian	CONCEPT
pacemaker	CONCEPT
is	
usually	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
and	
requires	
daily	
input	
from	
the	
environment	
to	
maintain	
synchrony	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
day	
.	

The	
light	
-	
dark	
cycle	
is	
the	
most	
important	
environmental	
time	
cue	
(	
zeitgeber	
)	
in	
humans	
(	
as	
in	
other	
species	
)	
,	
although	
nonphotic	
time	
cues	
also	
play	
a	
role	
in	
normal	
entrainment	
.	

A	
lack	
of	
photic	
input	
to	
the	
circadian	CONCEPT
pacemaker	CONCEPT
is	
clearly	
the	
cause	
of	
nonentrained	
rhythms	
in	
totally	SYMPTOM
blind	SYMPTOM
people	
.	

It	
has	
been	
suggested	
that	
,	
in	
sighted	
individuals	
,	
a	
systematic	
delay	
due	
to	
inadequate	
exposure	
to	
light	
may	
contribute	
to	
the	
development	
of	
N24SWD	CONDITION
.	

In	
addition	
,	
the	
disorder	
may	
be	
caused	
by	
an	
extremely	
prolonged	
endogenous	
circadian	CONCEPT
period	CONCEPT
that	
is	
outside	
of	
the	
range	
for	
entrainment	
to	
the	
24	
-	
hour	
cycle	
or	
by	
an	
alteration	
in	
the	
response	
of	
the	
circadian	CONCEPT
clock	CONCEPT
to	
the	
entraining	
effects	
of	
light	
.	

Objective	
Findings	
Sleep	TEST
studies	TEST
yield	
different	
results	
depending	
on	
the	
degree	
of	
synchrony	
between	
sleep	
times	
and	
the	
circadian	CONCEPT
pacemaker	CONCEPT

Serial	
measurements	
of	
circadian	CONCEPT
rhythms	CONCEPT
,	
such	
as	
melatonin	TEST
,	
usually	
show	
a	
progressive	
daily	
delay	
of	
the	
phase	
of	
the	
rhythm	
consistent	
with	
a	
period	
that	
is	
longer	
than	
24	
hours	
.	

Clinical	
and	
Pathophysiologic	
Subtypes	
Totally	
blind	
patients	
with	
N24SWD	CONDITION
are	
clinically	
different	
than	
sighted	
patients	
.	

In	
sighted	
patients	
with	
N24SWD	CONDITION
,	
the	
circadian	CONCEPT
period	CONCEPT
is	
often	
25	
hours	
or	
longer	
,	
whereas	
in	
totally	
blind	
patients	
with	
the	
disorder	
,	
the	
circadian	CONCEPT
period	CONCEPT
follows	
an	
average	
period	
length	
which	
is	
often	
closer	
to	
24	
hours	
and	
rarely	
may	
be	
shorter	
than	
24	
hours	
.

Some	
individuals	
with	
severe

progressive

their	
sleep	
period	
by	
30	
minutes	
or	
more	
for	
several	
days

their

In

however	
,	
multiple	
physio-	CONCEPT
logic	CONCEPT
,	
behavioral

and	
environmental

contribute	
to	
the	
condition

In	
the	
major-	
ity	
of	
these	
cases	
,	
the	
disorder	
should	
be	
coded	
as	
N24SWD	CONDITION

non-24-

a

a	
progressive

The

most	
commonly	
reported	
in	
association	
with	
night	
shifts	
,	
early	
morning	
shifts

and	
rotating	
shifts

Total	
sleep	
time	
is	
typically	
curtailed	
by	
one	
to	
four	
hours	
,	
and	
sleep	
quality	
is	
perceived	
as	
unsatisfactory	
in	
night

as	
well	
as	
in

In	
addition	
to	
impairment

also	
be	
associated	
with

during	
the	
work	
schedule	
and	
on	
the	
commute	
to	
and

The	
sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
occurs	
despite	
attempts	
to	
optimize	
environmental	
conditions	
for	
sleep	
.	

The	
condition	
usually	
persists	
only	
for	
the	
duration	
of	
the	
shift	
work	
schedule

However	
,	
in	
some

Excessive	
sleepiness	
usually	
occurs	
during	
work	
shifts	
(	
mainly	
night	
,	
early	
morning	
,	
and	
rotating	
shifts	
)	
,	
often	
accompanied	
by	
the	
need	
to	
nap	
and	
by	
impaired	
mental	
ability	
due	
to	
the	
reduced	SYMPTOM
alertness	SYMPTOM
.	

Reduced	
alertness	
and	
increased	
fatigue	
throughout	
the	
waking	
period	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
reduced	
performance

and	
with	
consequences

Also

major	
portions

have	
to	
be	
used	
for

Demographics	
The	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
disorder	
depends	
on	
the	
prevalence	
of	
shift	
work	
in	
the	
population	
.	

It	
has	
been	
estimated	
that	
approximately	
20	
%	
of	
the	
workforce	
in	
indus-	
trialized	
countries	
is	
employed	
in	
a	
job	
that	
requires	
shift	
work	
.	

Although	
the	
actual	
prevalence

clinically	
significant	
sleep	SYMPTOM

There	
is	
no

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
Depending	
on	
the	
type	
of	
shift	
,	
circadian	CONCEPT
preference	CONCEPT
may	
influence	
the	
ability	
to	
adjust	
to	
or	
tolerate	
shift	
work	
.	

For	
example	
,	
individuals	
described	
as	
morning	
types	
obtain	
shorter	
daytime	
sleep	
after	
a	
night	
shift

such	
as

and	
individuals	
with	
a	
strong	
need

may	
be	
at	
particular	
risk

Social	RISKFACTOR
pressures	RISKFACTOR
before

after	
a

also	
contribute	
to	
short	SYMPTOM

Social	RISKFACTOR

The	
condition	
is	
closely	
linked	
to	
work	
schedules	
and	
typically	
remits	
when	
the	
major	
sleep	
episode	
is	
scheduled	
at	
a	
conventional	
time	
.	

Because	
there	
are	
so	
many	
different	
work	
schedules	
,	
ranging	
from	
an	
occasional	
overnight	
shift	
to	
regular	
night	
work	
,	
the	
course	
is	
quite	
variable	
.	

Because	
shift	
work	
is	
often	
combined	
with	
extended	
hours	
of	
duty	
,	
fatigue	SYMPTOM
can	
be	
a	
complicating	
factor	
.	
Circadian	CONCEPT
adaptation	CONCEPT
is	
often	
counteracted	
by	
exposure	
to	
light	
at	
the	
wrong	
time	
of	
the	
day	
and	
the	
tendency	
of	
most	
workers	
to	
resume	
full	
daytime	
activities	
and	
nighttime	
sleep	
during	
weekends	
and	
vacations	
.	

It	
has	
been	
hypothesized	
that	
in

the

The

The

to	
be	
partly	
related	
to	
cumulative

Tolerance

considerably

Human	
consciousness	
consists	
of	
three	
essential	
states	
:	
Wake	
,	
NREM	
sleep	
,	
and	
REM	
sleep	
.	

The	
three	
states	
are	
modulated	
by	
a	
host	
of	
influences	
including	
the	
degree	
of	
ami-	
nergic	
and	
cholinergic	
neurochemical	
bias	
,	
central	
nervous	
system	
(	
CNS	
)	
activation	
,	
Parasomnias	CONDITION
and	
the	
degree	
of	
endogenous	
versus	
exogenous	
input	
.	

Under	
normal	
physiologic	
conditions	
,	
which	
include	
homeostatic	
drive	
and	
circadian	
rhythmicity	
,	
the	
process	
of	
state	
declaration	
is	
maintained	
in	
a	
stable	
and	
predictable	
fashion	
throughout	
a	
24	
-	
hour	
period	
.	

However	
,	
as	
the	
sleep	
-	
wake	
cycle	
oscillates	
,	
the	
normally	
distinct	
states	
of	
con-	
sciousness	
may	
be	
rendered	
into	
a	
state	
that	
is	
not	
fully	
declared	
,	
resulting	
in	
a	
tempo-	
rary	
unstable	
state	
of	
dissociation	CONDITION
.	

Thus	
,	
sleep	
and	
wake	
can	
be	
viewed	
as	
occurring	
on	
a	
spectrum	
rather	
than	
being	
entirely	
dichotomous	
states	
.	
Parasomnias	CONDITION
are	
the	
result	
of	
such	
state	
dissociation	CONDITION

Recent	
research	
has	
shown	
that	
com-	
binations	
of	
one	
or	
more	
of	
these	
states	
do	
occur	
and	
may	
result	
in	
unstable	
states	
of	
altered	
consciousness	
manifesting	
as	
parasomnias	CONDITION

The	
comingling	
of	
basic	
states	
of	
consciousness	
is	
the	
result	
of	
different	
forms

In

to	
the	
occurrence	
of	
NREM

NREM	
disorders

frequently	
appear	
to	
involve	
the	
disinhibition	
of	
“

”	
such	
as	
feeding	
,	
sex	
,	
and	
aggression

Here	
,	
it	
has	
been	
postulated	
that	
central	
pattern	
generators	
elicit	
primal	
fixed	
action	
patterns	
that	
would	
otherwise	
have	
been	
inhibited	
by	
the	
prefrontal	
cortex	
during

In	
this

,	
aggression	
is	
typ-	
ically	
abrupt	
in	
onset	
and	
characterized	
by	
apparent	
instinctual	
defensive	
posturing	
as	
opposed	
to	
behaviors	
that	
are	
complex	
and	
procedural	
.	

These	
can	
emerge

the

the

It	
is	
frequently	
pos-	
sible	
to	
correlate	
observed

later	
descriptions

the

The

the

emerge	
in	
children	
aged	
four

12

(	
but	
can	
also	
emerge	
in	
adulthood	
)	
and	
tend	
to	
resolve	
spontaneously	
by	
early	
adolescence	
,	
as	
does	
sleep-	
walking	
.	

Social	
embarrassment

can	
impair	
social	
relationships	
in	
children

even

can	
occur

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
noted	
above	
,	
disorders	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
most	
often	
occur	
initially	
in	
childhood	
and	
decrease	
in	
occurrence	
steadily	
until	
young	
adulthood	
.	

However	
,	
they	
may	
occur	
for	
the	
first	
time	
in	
adulthood	
or	
reappear	
after	
many	
asymptomatic	
years	
,	
often	
related	
to	
stress

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
overwhelming	
majority	
of	
individuals	
with	
disorders	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
do	
not	
have	
neuro-	
logical	
or	
psychological	
pathology	
.	

There	
are	
rare	
reported	
cases	
of	
confusional	
arous-	
als	
associated	
with	
brain	
lesions	
in	
areas	
subserving	
arousal	
,	
such	
as	
the	
posterior	
hypothalamus	
,	
midbrain	
reticular	
area	
,	
and	
periventricular	
gray	
matter	
.	

However	
,	
data	
from	
a	
single	
patient	
with	
confusional	
arousals	
suggest	
that	
they	
may	
be	
due	
to	
a	
func-	
tional	
abnormality	
in	
the	
brain	
that	
leaves	
some	
regions	
,	
such	
as	
hippocampus	
and	
Parasomnias	
Parasomnias	
frontal	
associative	
cortices	
,	
asleep	
,	
while	
other	
parts	
of	
the	
brain	
such	
as	
motor	
,	
cingu-	
late	
,	
insular	
,	
amygdala	
,	
and	
temporopolar	
cortices	
,	
are	
active	
or	
awake	
.	

It	
is	
generally	
considered	
that	
disorders	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
represent	
a	
dissociation	
of	
different	
regions	
of	
the	
brain	
in	
addition	
to	
activation	
of	
locomotor

Objective	
Findings	

Although	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
for	
the	
evaluation	
of	
typical	
,	
uncomplicated	
,	
and	
non-	
injurious	
parasomnias	
,	
polysomnographic	TEST

arousal	CONDITION
typically	
begin	
after	
an	
arousal

most	
commonly	
toward	
the

Diagnostic	TEST

may	
note	
high

and	
frequent	
arousals

However	
,	
these	
findings	
have	
a	
low	
spec-	
ificity	
and	
have	
been	
reported	
to	
occur	
in	
other

such	
as	
OSA	CONDITION
and	
in	
asymp-

individuals	
.	

On	
rare	
occasions	
,	
polysomnography	TEST
can	
provide	
support	
for	
the	
clinical	TREATMENT

Out

are	
very	
rare	
in

Changes	
between	
the	
home	
and	
sleep	
laboratory	
environment	
,	
timing	
,	
habits	
,	
and	
other	
factors	
may	
serve	
to	
decrease	
the

in	
the	
laboratory

is	
to	
be	
used	
as

,	
a

In

there	
is	
a

However

Although	
the	
“

of

(

the

generally	
preserved

the

can	
be	
perturbed	
.	
Power	TEST
spectral	TEST
analyses	TEST
of	
slow

in	
adult

have	
revealed	
several	
forms

including	
high	
amounts

fragmentation	
(	
particularly	
during	
the	
first

a	
significant

Differential	
Diagnosis	
Disorders	
of	
arousal	
should	
be	
carefully	
distinguished	
from	
other	
disorders	
with	
similar	
presentations	
,	
but	
different	
pathophysiologies	
,	
courses	
,	
and	
treatments	
.	

Other	
disorders	
to	
be	
considered	
include	
RBD	CONDITION
,	
sleep	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
epilepsy	CONDITION
,	
sleep	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
dissocia-	CONDITION
tive	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
,	
alcohol	CONDITION
and	CONDITION
drug	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
behaviors	CONDITION
,	
and	
OSA	CONDITION
.	
RBD	CONDITION
typically	
presents	
as	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
during	
the	
second	
half	
of	
the	
night	
and	
usually	
affects	
middle	
-	
aged	
men	
,	
but	
also	
can	
affect	
women	
and	
virtually	
any	
age	
group	
.	

Because	
sleepwalking	CONDITION
in	
adults	
can	
also	
present	
as	
dream	
-	
enacting	
behaviors	
that	
emerge	
during	
any	
time	
of	
the	
night	
,	
vPSG	TEST
may	
be	
necessary	
to	
distinguish	
sleep-	
walking	
from	
RBD	CONDITION
.	

In	
contrast	
to	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
,	
signs	
of	
RBD	CONDITION
,	
particularly	
tonic	
/	
phasic	
EMG	
activity	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
are	
almost	
always	
present	
during	
sleep	TEST
studies	TEST
.	

If	
sleepwalking	CONDITION
(	
or	
sleep	SYMPTOM
terrors	SYMPTOM
)	
occurs	
with	
RBD	CONDITION

This	
has	
been	
referred	
to	
as	
a	
parasomnia	CONDITION
overlap	
disorder	
.	

Other	
sleep	
disorders	
,	
such	
as	
OSA	CONDITION
,	
can	
precipitate	
disorders	
of	
arousal	
.	

Therefore	
,	
a	
careful	
history	
must	
be	
obtained	
to	
identify	
other	
sleep	
disorders	
.	
Sleep	CONDITION
related	CONDITION
epilepsy	CONDITION
can	
manifest	
with	
wandering	SYMPTOM
behavior	SYMPTOM
or	
with	
frenzied	SYMPTOM
walking	SYMPTOM
or	
running	
.	

In	
adults	
,	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
malingering	CONDITION
also	
should	
be	
considered	
.	

If	
a	
neurologic	
or	
medical	
disor-	
der	
is	
identified	
as	
the	
precipitant	
of	
a	
disorder	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
,	
then	
the	
sleepwalking	
should	
be	
diagnosed	
as	
parasomnia	CONDITION
due	
to	
a	
medical	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
.	
Disorders	CONDITION
of	CONDITION
arousal	CONDITION
should	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
in	
the	
presence	
of	
alcohol	CONDITION
intoxication	CONDITION

However	
,	
the	
sleepwalker	CONDITION
is	
typically	
severely	
cognitively	
impaired	
,	
but	
with	
only	
limited	
motor	
impairment	
.	

The	
alcohol	CONDITION
-	CONDITION
intoxicated	CONDITION
individual	
’s	
level	
of	
cognitive	
functioning	
may	
be	
reduced	
,	
but	
not	
absent	
,	
whereas	
motor	
behavior	
is	
often	
severely	
impaired	
.	

In	
alcoholic	SYMPTOM
blackouts	SYMPTOM
,	
where	
anterograde	CONDITION
amnesia	CONDITION
is	
,	
by	
definition	
,	
Parasomnias	CONDITION
Parasomnias	CONDITION
the	
cardinal	
manifestation	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
note	
that	
outward	
motor	
behavior	
and	
cog-	
nitive	
function	
may	
not	
be	
impaired	
and	
may	
be	
perceived	
as	
normal	
.	

Thus	
,	
the	
impor-	
tance	
of	
appreciating	
the	
neuroscience	CONCEPT
of	
alcoholic	SYMPTOM
blackouts	SYMPTOM
and	
its	
potential	
role	
in	
the	
explanation	
of	
unusual	
and	
bizarre	
nocturnal	
behaviors	
can	
not	
be	
understated	
because	
these	
can	
mimic	
parasomnias	CONDITION
.	

The	
former	
are	
exponentially	
more	
prevalent	
and	
thus	
should	
be	
given	
appropriate	
weight	
when	
attributing	
likely	
causation	
in	
cases	
with	
criminal	RISKFACTOR
allegations	RISKFACTOR

Unresolved

direct	
research	
into	
the

Essential	
Features	
SRED	CONCEPT

On	
the	
one	
hand	
,	
some	
patients	
can	
not	
be	
easily	
brought	
to	
full	
consciousness	
during	
an	
episode	
of	
eating	
,	
as	
is	
the	
case	
with	
sleepwalking	
,	
and	
may	
have	
no	
recall	
of	
having	
eaten	
during	
the	
night	
.	

On	
the	
other	
hand	
,	
some	
patients	
seemingly	
have	
considerable	
alertness	
during	
an	
episode	
and	
have	
substantial	
recall	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

There	
may	
be	
variability	
of	
awareness	
and	
subsequent	
recall	
within	
one	
night	
,	
and	
across	
the	
evolution	
of	
the	
disorder	
in	
individual	
patients	
.	

The	
recurrent	
episodes	
of	
involuntary	
eating	
and	
drinking	
during	
the	
main	
sleep	
period	
are	
typically	
associated	
with	
a	
feeling	
of	
lack	
of	
control	
over	
eating	
.	

Problematic	
features	
of	
the	
recurrent	
sleep

Nightly	
eating	
,	
including	
multiple	
episodes

is	
reported	
by	
a	
majority

occur	
during	
any	
time	
in	
the

,	
hunger	SYMPTOM
and	
thirst	SYMPTOM
are	
notably	
absent	
during	
episodes	
of	
compulsive	
eating	
with	
SRED	CONDITION

The	
episodes	
of	
eating	
are	
some-	
times	
experienced	
as	
food

enactment	
of	
a	
dream

Simple	
foods

Alcoholic	
beverages	
are	
almost	
never	
consumed

occurrence	
in

although	
detailed	
genetic	
studies	
have	
not

carried	
out

Onset	
,	
Course	
,	
and	
Complications	
The	
onset	
of	
SRED	CONDITION
can	
be	
insidious	
and	
sporadic	
,	
or	
it	
can	
be	
precipitous	
and	
fulmi-	
nant	
with	
rapid	
development	
of	
nightly	
episodes	
of	
eating	
,	
related	
or	
unrelated	
to	
the	
start	
of	
hypnotic	TREATMENT
medication	TREATMENT
therapy	
of	
insomnia	SYMPTOM

The	
course	
is	
usually	
unremitting	
.	

Fires	
can	
occur	
when	
the	
individual	
with	
SRED	CONDITION
begins	
to	
cook	
foods	
on	
the	
stove	
or	
in	
the	
oven	
,	
and	
then	
abandons	
them	
.	

A	
variety	
of	
other	
complications	
have	
been	
described	
previously	
.	

Developmental	
Issues	
SRED	CONDITION
can	
emerge	
in	
childhood	
,	
either	
associated	
or	
unassociated	
with	
a	
family	
history	
of	
SRED	CONDITION
.	

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
underlying	
pathophysiology	
of	
SRED	CONDITION
is	
unclear	
.	

Despite	
the	
broad	
range	
of	
pre-	
disposing	
and	
precipitating	
factors	
in	
SRED	CONDITION
,	
the	
relatively	
homogeneous	
set	
of	
clinical	
features	
suggests	
the	
presence	
of	
a	
“	
final	
common	
pathway	
”	
that	
can	
be	
accessed	
by	
a	
variety	
of	
factors	
.	

Although	
SRED	CONDITION
has	
prominent	
features	
of	
both	
a	
sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
and	
an	
eating	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
,	
its	
relatively	
homogeneous	
presentation	
supports	
its	
classification	
as	
a	
separate	
diagnostic	
entity	
.	

More	
than	
half	
of	
patients	
with	
SRED	CONDITION
have	
a	
history	
of	
another	
parasomnia	CONDITION
that	
preceded	
the	
onset	
of	
nocturnal	
eating	
,	
suggesting	
that	
the	
presence	
of	
another	
parasomnia	RISKFACTOR
is	
a	
major	
risk	
factor	
for	
SRED	CONDITION

However	
,	
the	
female	
predominance	
in	
SRED	CONDITION
is	
more	
consistent	
with	
eating	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
,	
which	
are	
female	
pre-	
dominant	
,	
than	
with	
sleepwalking	
or	
movement	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
(	
RLS	CONDITION
/	
PLMD	CONDITION
)	
which	
have	
slight	
to	
no	
female	
bias	
.	

Thus	
it	
appears	
that	
two	
basic	
drive	
states	
—	
sleeping	
and	
eating	
—	
are	
pathologically	
intertwined	
in	
SRED	
.

Objective	
Findings	
Although	
not	
routinely	
indicated	
in	
the	
assessment	
of	
SRED	
,	
vPSG	TEST
evaluations	
have	
often	
reported	
positive	
findings

The	
most	
common	
finding	
consists	
of	
multiple	
confu-	
sional	
arousals	
,	
with	
or	
without	
eating	
,	
arising	
from	
slow

However	
,	
abnor-	
mal	
arousals	
have	
been	
documented	
from	
all	
stages	
of	
NREM	
sleep	
and	
also	
occasion-	
ally	
from	
REM	
sleep

The	
level	
of	
consciousness	
has	
typically	
spanned	
the	
range	
from	
virtual	
unconsciousness	
to	
various	
levels	
of	
partial	
consciousness	
despite	
a	
concurrent	
EEG	TEST
pattern	
that	
is	
often	
predominantly	
awake	
,	
suggesting	
dissociation	CONCEPT
between	
the	
EEG	TEST
and	
the	
level	
of	
consciousness	
.	

This	
dissociation	CONCEPT

A	
predominant	
wake	
pattern	
is	
rare	
in	
childhood	
sleep-

PLMs	SYMPTOM
and

may	
be	
observed	
in

and	
29	
of	
35	
had	
recurring	
chewing

during

that	
were	
associated	
with	
nearly	
half	
of	
the	
total

include	
both

Walking	
,	
however	
,	
is	
quite	
uncommon	
with	
RBD	CONDITION
,	
and	
leaving	
the	
room	
is	
especially	
rare	
,	
because	
the	
eyes	
are	
usually	
closed	
,	
precluding	
attention	
to	
the	
environment

There	
can	
be	
rare	
occurrences

smoking	
a	
fictive

The	
eyes	
usually	
remain	
closed	
during	
an	
RBD	CONDITION
episode	
,	
with	
the	
person	
attending	
to	
the	
dream	
action

not

either	
the	
person

and	
rarely

Because	
RBD	CONDITION
occurs	
during	
REM	
sleep	
,	
it	
usually	
appears	
at	
least	
90	
minutes	
after

unless	
there	
is	
coexisting	
narcolepsy	CONDITION

There	
is	
an	
acute	
form	
of

and	
Complications	
Onset	
of	
chronic	
RBD	CONDITION
can	
be	
gradual	
or	
rapid	
,	
and	
the	
course	
is	
often	
progressive

Complications	
include	
sleep

injuries	
to	
self	
and/or	
bed	
partner	
that	
at	
times	
are	
life	
threatening	
,	
and	
disruption	
of	
the	
bed

that	
can	
be	
severe

Marital

Developmental	
Issues	
As	
stated	
previously	
,	
RBD	CONDITION
can	
emerge	
in

usually	
in

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Current	
evidence	
suggests	
a	
selective	
association	
between	
RBD	CONDITION
and	
neurodegenera-	CONDITION
tive	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
.	CONDITION

The	
synucleinopathies	CONDITION
comprise	
a	
set	
of	
neurodegenerative	CONDITION
disorders	CONDITION
that	
share	
a	
common	
pathologic	
lesion	
composed	
of	
aggregates	
of	
insoluble	
α	
-	
synu-	
clein	
protein	
in	
selectively	
vulnerable	
populations	
of	
neurons	
and	
glial	
cells	
.	

These	
pathologic	
aggregates	
appear	
to	
be	
closely	
linked	
to	
the	
onset	
and	
progression	
of	
clin-	SYMPTOM
ical	SYMPTOM
symptoms	SYMPTOM
and	
the	
degeneration	
of	
affected	
brain	
regions	
in	
neurodegenerative	
disorders	
.	

The	
major	
synucleinopathies	CONDITION
include	
PD	CONDITION
,	
DLB	CONDITION
,	
and	
MSA	CONDITION
.	CONDITION
RBD	CONDITION
can	
be	
strongly	
linked	
with	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
(	
almost	
always	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION

)	
,	
rep-	
resenting	
another	
form	
of	
REM	CONDITION
sleep	CONDITION
motor	CONDITION
-	CONDITION
behavioral	CONDITION
dyscontrol	CONDITION
.	

The	
RBD	CONDITION
may	
be	
precipitated	
or	
worsened	
by	
the	
pharmacologic	TREATMENT
treatment	TREATMENT
of	
cataplexy	CONDITION

RBD	
associ-	
ated	
with	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
is	
now	
considered	
to	
be	
a	
distinct	
phenotype	
of	
RBD	CONDITION
,	
character-	
ized	
by	
lack	
of	
sex	
predominance	
,	
less	
complex	
and	
more	
elementary	
movements	
in	
REM	
sleep	
,	
less	
violent	
behavior	
in	
REM

earlier	
age

and	
hypocretin	SYMPTOM
deficiency	SYMPTOM
(	
that	
is	
characteristic	
of	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
type	CONDITION
1	CONDITION
)	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
RBD	CONDITION
in	
pediat-	
ric	
patients	
may	
be	
an	
initial	
manifestation	
of	
narcolepsy	CONDITION

The	
pathophysiology	
of	
human	
RBD	CONDITION
is	
presumed	
to	
correspond	
to	
the	
findings	
from	
an	
animal	
model	
of	
RBD	CONDITION
with	
respect	
to	
interruption	
of	
the	
REM	
atonia	
pathway	
and/	
or	
disinhibition	
of

activity	
of	
the

Some	
patients	
have	
almost	
exclusively	
arm

hand	
behaviors	
during	
REM

indicating	
the	
need	
for	
both	
upper

extremity	
EMG	
monitoring	
in	
fully	
evaluating	
for	
RBD	CONDITION

Some	
patients	
preserve	
most	
of	
their	
REM	
atonia	
but	
have	
excessive	
EMG	
twitching	
during	
REM

The	
most	
current	
evidence	
-	
based	
data	
for	
detecting	
RWA	
in

Approximately	
75

The	
occurrence	
of	
occasional

not

However	
,	
frequent

occurring	
in	
1	
%

Nightmares	SYMPTOM
appear	
to	
be	
a	
trait

persists	
over

The	
best	
predictor	
of	
recurrent	
nightmares	SYMPTOM
at	
an

Approximately

Trauma

Predisposing

nightmares	SYMPTOM
are	
associated	
with	
enduring

they	
are

Associations

As

nightmares	SYMPTOM
are	
very	
common	
in	
children

the	
occurrence	
of	
occa-	
sional	
nightmares	SYMPTOM
does	
not	
constitute	
nightmare	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION
.	

Population	
studies	
have	
revealed	
that	
the	
prevalence	
and	
frequency	
of	
nightmares	SYMPTOM
increases	
through	
childhood	
into	
adolescence	
.	

For	
example	
,	
preschoolers	
seldom	
report	
“

Furthermore	
,	
in

,	
children	
appear	
to	
exhibit	
a	
sex

It

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

Basic	
pathophysiologic

are	
still	
needed

especially	
studies	
contrasting	
“	
idio-	
pathic	
”	
nightmare	
disorder	
and	
nightmares	SYMPTOM
associated	
with	
PTSD	CONDITION
.	

In	
particular	
,	
deter-	
mining	
whether	
posttraumatic	
nightmares	SYMPTOM
arise	
from	
sleep	
or	
primarily	
from	
wakeful-	
ness	
would	
be	
an	
important	
distinguishing	
feature	
particularly	
when	
determining	
effec-	
tive	
clinical	
interventions	
.	

The	
PSG	TREATMENT
correlates	
of	
nightmare	
disorder	
and	
posttraumatic	
nightmares	SYMPTOM
as	
well	
as	
the	
variables	
affecting	
dream	
mentation	
and	
recall	
require	
further	
definition	
and	
delineation	
.	

The	
distinction	
between	
nightmares	SYMPTOM
and	
sleep	SYMPTOM
terrors	SYMPTOM
is	
difficult	
when	
assessed	
only	
by	
questionnaires	TEST
.	

It	
still	
remains	
unclear	
to	
what	
degree	
and	
level	
of	
complexity	
sleep	
mentation	
is	
associated	
with	
sleep	SYMPTOM
terrors	SYMPTOM
.	

The	
topic	
of	
NREM	
sleep	
dream	
distur-	
bances	
(	
other	
than	
disturbed	
mentation	
that	
may	
occur	
with	
sleep	SYMPTOM
terrors	SYMPTOM
)	
also	
needs	
formal	
investigation	
,	
including	
whether	
or	
not	
the	
term	
NREM	
sleep	
nightmare	SYMPTOM

The	
optimal	
methods	
for	
assessing	
nightmare	SYMPTOM
frequency	
and	
nightmare	SYMPTOM
distress	RISKFACTOR
are	
still	
unclear	
.	

Standardized	
scales	
assessing	
nightmare	SYMPTOM

should	
be	
developed	
and	
utilized	
.	

Retrospective	
questionnaire	
-

evaluations	
of	
nightmares	SYMPTOM
are	
problematic	
inasmuch	
as	
they	
underestimate	
nightmare	SYMPTOM

Essential	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
are	
hallucinatory	
experiences	
that	
occur	
at	
sleep	
onset	
or	
on	
awakening	
from	
sleep	
.	

Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
are	
predominantly	
visual	
but	
may	
include	
auditory	
,	
tactile	
,	
or	
kinetic	
phenomena	
.	
Hallucinations	SYMPTOM
at

(	
hypnagogic	SYMPTOM

may	
be

ing	
.	
Hallucinations	SYMPTOM
on	
waking	
in	
the	
morning	
(	
hypnopompic	SYMPTOM
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
)	
may	
arise	
out	
of	
a	
period	
of	
REM	
sleep	
,	
and	
patients	
also	
may	
be	
uncertain	
whether	
they	
rep-	
resent	
waking	
or	
dream	
-	
related	
experiences	
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
may	
represent	
a	
distinct	
form	
of	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM

They	
typically	
occur	
fol-	
lowing	
a	
sudden	
awakening	
,	
without	
recall	
of	
a	
preceding	
dream	
.	

They	
usually	
take	
the	
form	
of	
complex	
,	
vivid	
,	
relatively	
immobile	
images	
of	
people	
or	
animals	
,	
sometimes	
distorted	
in	
shape	
or	
size	
.	

These	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
may	
remain	
present	
for	
many	
minutes	
but	
usually	
disappear	
if	
ambient	
illumination	
is	
increased	
.	

Patients	
are	
clearly	
awake	
but	
often	
initially	
perceive	
the	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
as	
real	
and	
frightening	
.	

Associated	
Features	
Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
may	
be	
associated	
with	
episodes	
of	
sleep	SYMPTOM
paralysis	SYMPTOM
,	
either	
at	
the	
same	
time	
or	
on	
different	
nights	
.	

Patients	
with	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hal-	
lucinations	
may	
jump	
out	
of	
the	
bed	
in	
terror	
,	
sometimes	
injuring	
themselves	
.	

Some	
patients	
may	
experience	
other	
parasomnias	CONDITION
,	
such	
as	
sleep	SYMPTOM
talking	SYMPTOM
or	
sleepwalking	
,	
sep-	
arate	
from	
the	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
;	
some	
patients	
may	
also	
experience	
similar	
complex	
hal-	
lucinations	
during	
the	
day	
,	
unassociated	
with	
sleep

hypnagogic

hallucinations	
appear	
to	
differ	
in	
clini-	
cal	
features	
and	
pathogenesis	
from	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM

Sleep	
related	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
are	
common	
in	
narcolepsy	
and	
also	
occur	
as	
occasional	
phenomena	
in	
a	
high	
per-	
centage	
of	
the	
general	
population	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucina-	
tions	
appear	
to	
be	
rare	
and	
occur	
in	
the	
setting	
of	
a	
range	
of	
neurologic	
and	
visual	
disorders	
(	
see	
Differential	TREATMENT
Diagnosis	TREATMENT
)	
as	
well	
as	
in	
an	
idiopathic	
form	
.	

However	
,	
further	
work	
is	
needed	
to	
establish	
whether	
or	
not	
these	
forms	
of	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
represent	
different	
entities	
.	

Demographics	
In	
large	
European	
population	
studies	
,	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
have	
been	
reported	
to	
occur	
with	
a	
prevalence	
of	
25	
%	
to	
37	
%	
for	
hypnagogic	SYMPTOM
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
,	
whereas	
the	
equivalent	
reported	
prevalence	
for	
hypnopompic	SYMPTOM
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
is	
7	
%	
to	
13	
%	
.	

Both	
hypnagogic	
and	
hypnopompic	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
are	
more	
common	
in	
younger	
persons	
and	
occur	
slightly	
more	
frequently	
in	
women	
than	
in	
men	
.	

Predisposing

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
It	
is	
presumed	
that	
most	
sleep	
related	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
are	
due	
to	
dream	
ideation	
of	
REM	
sleep	
intruding	
into	
wakefulness	
,	
but	
this	
has	
not	
been	
firmly	
established	
.	

Infrequent	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
of	
this	
type	
may	
be	
within	
the	
limits	
of	
normal	
sleep	
-	
wake	
transition	
.	

Complex	
nocturnal	
visual	
hallucinations	SYMPTOM
may	
in	
some	
cases	
be	
release	
phenomena	
in	
which	
loss	
of	
visual	
input	
or	
decreased	
reticular	
activating	
system	
activity	
results	
in	
the	
visual	
cortex	
generating	
aberrant

Predisposing	
and	
Precipitating	
Factors	
The	
etiology	
of	
SE	
is	
complex	
.	

The	
factors	
that	
precipitate	
SE	
on	
a	
particular	
night	
and	
at	
a	
particular	
time	
remain	
unknown	
.	

One	
popular	
model	
hypothesizes	
that	
SE	
consists	
of	
three	
interrelated	
factors	
:	
large	
nocturnal	
urine	
volume	
production	
,	
noc-	SYMPTOM
turnal	SYMPTOM
bladder	SYMPTOM
overactivity	SYMPTOM
,	
and	
difficulty	
arousing	
from	
sleep	
.	

Several	
studies	
suggest	
difficulty	
arousing	
from	
sleep	
is	
most	
important	
in	
primary	
enuresis	
,	
whereas	
bladder	SYMPTOM
instability	SYMPTOM
/	
overactivity	
is	
more	
important	
in	
secondary	
enuresis	
.	

Children	
with	
enuresis	
are	
often	
described	
by	
their	
families	
as	
“	
deep	
sleepers	
”	
and	
very	
difficult	
to	
arouse	
.	

A	
high	
arousal	
threshold	
has	
been	
objectively	
confirmed	
in	
these	
children	
.	

It	
has	
been	
reported	
that	
fragmentation	
of	
sleep	
by	
disorders	
such	
as	
sleep	CONDITION
apnea	CONDITION
is	
highly	
correlated	
with	
SE

Sleep

sleepwalking	SYMPTOM

Unresolved

Directions	
Recent

suggest	
that	
the

be	
overly	
simplistic

Further	
work	
is	
necessary	
to	
understand	
the	
genetic

clinical	
aspects	
of	
SE

Other	
sleep	CONDITION

are	
common	
in	
children	
with

Though	
it	
may	
be	
possible	
that

related	
arousals	
in

with	
SRBD	CONDITION

In	
such	
cases	
,	
the	
underlying

may	
be	
the	
stimulus

and

fragmentation	
to

performed

have	
been	
inconsistent	
.	

This	
is	
likely	
due	
to	
differing	
definitions

and	
varying	
research	
methodologies

Further	
sophisticated

the

Caffeine	
and	
chocolate	
abuse	
have	
been	
implicated	
in	
causing

,	
the

The

However

which	
are

For

many

instead

the

Similar	
considerations

to	
the

RLS	CONDITION
is	
a	
sensorimotor	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION

strong	
,	
nearly	
irresist-

urge	SYMPTOM
to	SYMPTOM
move	SYMPTOM
the	SYMPTOM
limbs	SYMPTOM

This	
urge	SYMPTOM
to	SYMPTOM
move	SYMPTOM
is	
often	
but	
not	
always	
accompanied	
by	
other	
uncomfortable	SYMPTOM
sensations	SYMPTOM
felt	
deep	
inside	
the	
limbs	
or	
by	
a	
feeling	
that	
is	
simply	
difficult

to	
describe

Although	
the	
legs	
are	
most	
prominently	
affected	
,	
“

21	
%

Developmental	
Issues	
The	
accurate	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	CONDITION
in	
children	
and	
adolescents	
requires	
understanding	
of	
developmental	CONCEPT
language	CONCEPT
and	
cognitive	CONCEPT
skills	CONCEPT
.	CONCEPT

Adequate	
verbal	CONCEPT
skills	CONCEPT
are	
needed	
for	
children	
to	
communicate	
the	
sensory	
component	
of	
RLS	CONDITION
and	
description	
must	
be	
in	
“	
the	
child	
’s	
own	
words	
,	
”	
rather	
than	
by	
a	
parent	
or	
caretaker	
.	

For	
criterion	
A	
,	
children	
rarely	
use	
or	
understand	
the	
word	
“	
urge	
.	
”	

Instead	
they	
describe	
that	
their	
legs	
“	
need	
to	
”	
“	
have	
to	
”	
or	
“	
got	
to	
”	
move

,

,

Similar	
to	
adults	
,	
children	
report	
arm

in	
almost	
half	
of	
cases

Sitting	
in	
class	
,	
lying	
in	
bed	
,	
reading	
a	
book	
,	
and	
riding	
in	
a	
car	
are	
situations	
where	
children	
report	
onset	
or	
worsening	
of	
their	
symp-	
toms	
.	

Relief	
is	
typically	
achieved	
by	
moving	
around	
,	
walking	
,	
rubbing	
,	
kicking	
,	
or	
distraction	
.	

Perhaps	
as	
a	
result	
of	
prolonged	
periods	
of	
sitting	
in	
class	
,	
two	
thirds	
of	
children	
and	
adolescents	
with	
RLS	CONDITION
report	
daytime	
leg	SYMPTOM
sensations	SYMPTOM
.	

Because	
of	
this	
,	
for	
diagnostic	
criterion	
A3	
(	
worse	
in	
the	
evening	
/	
night	
)	
,	
it	
is	
important	
to	
compare	
equal	
duration	
of	
sitting	
or	
lying	
down	
in	
the	
day	
to	
sitting	
or	
lying

However	
,	
even	
with	
such	
comparisons	
,	
a	
significant	
subset	
of	
children	
do	
not	
report	
worsening	
at

meet

In	
child-	
hood	
,	
RLS	CONDITION
is	
frequently	
misdiagnosed	
as	
“

Four	
specific	
domains	
that	
are

RLS	CONDITION
are	
sleep

daily

Difficulties

Negative	
influence

academic	
impact	
due	
to	
dis-

Severity	
assessment

has	
thus	
far	
been	
limited	
to	
simple	
measures	
of	
self	
-	
reported	
frequency	
and	
intensity	
.	

Because	
pediatric	
RLS	CONDITION
is	
highly	
familial	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
RLS	CONDITION
in	
a	
first	
-	
degree	
rela-	
tive	
helps	
to	
increase	
diagnostic	
certainty	
in	
childhood	
RLS	CONDITION

Similarly	
,	
the	
presence	
of	
PLMS	SYMPTOM
or	
a	
history	
of	
PLMD	
is	
quite	
helpful	
in	
supporting	
an	
RLS	CONDITION
diagnosis	
in	
chil-	
dren	
.	

As	
in	
adults	
,	
approximately	
70	
%	
of	
children	
with	
RLS	CONDITION
demonstrate	
PLMS	SYMPTOM
≥	
5/

a

nearly	
90

PLMS	SYMPTOM
≥	
5/

are	
uncommon	
in	
pediatric	
normative

As	
noted	
above	
,	
pediatric	
RLS	
is	
comorbid	
with

in	
about	
one

movement

leg

The	
urge	
to	
move	
,	
if	
present	
at	
all	
,	
usually	
stems	
from	
awareness	
that	
movement	
produces	
relief	
rather	
than	
the	
strong	
primary	
urgency	
of	
movement	
felt	
with	
RLS	CONDITION

The	
presence	
of	
pain	
,	
however	
,	
does	
not	
exclude	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	CONDITION
,	
because	
about	
50	
%	
of	
patients	
with	
RLS	CONDITION
report	
their	
RLS	CONDITION
symptoms	
as	
painful	
.	

Although	
it	
is	
important	
that	
RLS	CONDITION
symptoms	
not	
be	
attributable	
solely	
to	
another	
medical	
or	
behavioral	
condition	
,	
it	
should	
also	
be	
appreciated	
that	
any	
of	
these	
mimics	
can	
occur	
in	
an	
individual	
who	
also	
has

In	
adults

normative	
values	
greater	
than	
five	
per

have	
been	
found	
in	
studies	
that	
did	
not	
exclude	
respiratory

related	
arousals	
(	
using	
sensitive	TEST
respiratory	TEST
monitoring	TEST
)	
and	
other	
causes	
for	
PLMS

Data	
suggest	
a	
partial	
overlap	
of

values	
between	
symptomatic	
and	
asymptomatic	
individuals	
,	
emphasizing	
the	
importance	
of	
clinical	
context	
over	
an	
absolute	
cutoff	
value	
.	
.	

If	
PLMS	
are	
present	
without	
clinical	
sleep	SYMPTOM

or	
daytime	
impairment	
,	
the	
PLMS

but	
criteria	
are	
not	
met	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	CONDITION

.	

The	
presence	
of	
insomnia	CONDITION
or	
hypersomnia	CONDITION
with	
PLMS	
is	
not	
sufficient	
to	
establish	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	CONDITION
.	

Studies	
have	
shown	
that	
in	
most	
cases	
the	
cause	
of	
the	
accompanying	
insomnia	CONDITION
or	
hypersomnia	CONDITION
is	
something	
other	
than	
the	
PLMS	
.	

To	
establish	
the	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	CONDITION
,	
it	
is	
essential	
to	
establish	
a	
reasonable	
cause	
-	
and	
-	
effect	
relationship	
between	
the	
insomnia	CONDITION
or	
hypersomnia	CONDITION
and	
the	
PLMS

This	
requires	
that	
other	
causes

insomnia	CONDITION

as	
anxiety	
or	
other	
causes	
of	
hypersomnia	CONDITION
such	
as	
obstructive	CONDITION

or	
narcolepsy	CONDITION

PLMS	
are	
common	
,	
but	
PLMD	CONDITION
is	
thought	
to	
be	
rare	
in	
adults	
.	
.	
PLMD	CONDITION
can	
not	
be	
diagnosed	
in	
the	
context	
of	
RLS	CONDITION
,	
narcolepsy	CONDITION
,	
untreated	
obstructive	CONDITION
sleep	CONDITION

or	
REM	CONDITION

;	
PLMS	
occur	
commonly	
in	
these	
conditions	
but	
the	
sleep	SYMPTOM
complaint	SYMPTOM
is	
more	
readily	
ascribed	
to	
the	
accompanying	
disorder

The	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	CONDITION
takes	
precedence	
over	
that

In

cases

the	
diagnosis	
of	
RLS	CONDITION
is

the	
PLMS

noted	
.

When	
it	
is	
reasonably

that	
the	
PLMS	
have	
been	
induced	
by

and	
full

it

Essential	
Features	
PLMD	CONDITION
is	
characterized	
by	
periodic	
episodes	
of	
repetitive	
,	
highly	
stereotyped	
limb	
movements	
that	
occur	
during	
sleep	
(	
PLMS	
)	
,	
in	
conjunction	
with	
clinical	
sleep	SYMPTOM
dis-	SYMPTOM
turbance	SYMPTOM
or	
fatigue	SYMPTOM
that	
can	
not	
be	
accounted	
for	
by	
another	
primary	
sleep	CONDITION
disorder	CONDITION

Similar	
movements	
can	
occur	
in	
the	
upper	
limbs	
.	

Individual	
movements	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
an	
autonomic	
arousal	
,	
a	
cortical	
arousal	
,	
or	
an	
awakening	
.	

Typically	
,	
the	
patient	
is	
unaware	
of	
the	
limb	
movements	
or	
the	
frequent	
sleep	
disruption	
.	

An	
arousal	
may	
precede	
,	
coincide	
with	
,	
or	
follow	
the	
limb	
movement	
,	
suggesting	
that	
a	
central	
generator	
may	
give	
rise	
to	
both	
the	
periodic	
movements	
and	
the	
related	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM

ing

PLMS	CONDITION

needed	
for	
a	
diagnosis	
of	
PLMD	CONDITION
.	

These	
symp-	SYMPTOM
toms	SYMPTOM
have	
most	
consistently	
been	
associated	
with	
PLMS	CONDITION
,	
and	
the	
presence	
of	
these	
clinical	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
differentiates	
PLMD	CONDITION
from	
asymptomatic	
PLMS	CONDITION

Although	
exces-	
sive	
daytime

A

The

PLMD	SYMPTOM
has	
not	
been	
studied

Families	
with	
RLS	SYMPTOM
have	
been

to	
include

relatives	
without	
RLS	SYMPTOM
but	
with	
increased	
rates	
of	
PLMS	SYMPTOM
or	
PLMD	SYMPTOM

raising	
the	
possibility	
that	
PLMD	SYMPTOM
is	
an	
attenuated	
manifestation	
or	
a	
precursor	
to	
RLS	SYMPTOM

Sleep	
starts	
typically	
are	
limited	
to	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness

sleep	
,	
are	
not

Unresolved	
Issues	
and	
Further	
Directions	

There	
has	
been	
controversy	
over	
the	
clinical	
significance	
of	
PLMS	SYMPTOM
.	

To	
date	
,	
the	
inter-	
pretation	
of	
most	
studies	
has	
been	
confounded	
by	
multiple	
factors	
that	
include	
:	
impre-	
cise	
diagnostic	CONCEPT
criteria	CONCEPT
;	
confusion	
between	
PLMS	
and	
PLMD	
;	
inadequate	
monitoring

subtle	
SRBDs	CONDITION
;	
a	
lack	
of	
consideration	
of	
medications	TREATMENT
known	
to	
induce	
,	
worsen	
,	
or	
suppress	
PLMS	SYMPTOM
;	
and	
inadequate	
measurement	
of	
the	
known	
night	
-	
to	
-	
night	
vari-	
ability	
of	
PLMS	
.	

Newer	
respiratory	
monitoring	
techniques	
for	
polysomnography	TEST
and	
the	
use	
of	
actigraphy	
monitors	
over	
several	
nights	
should	
help	
address	
a	
number	
of	
these	
issues	
.	

The	
role	
of	
associated	
arousals	
in	
relation	
to	
clinical	
symptoms	SYMPTOM
is	
yet	
to	
be	
determined	
,	
but	
the	
appreciation	
of	
autonomic	
arousals	
as	
well	
as	
cortical	
arousals	
might	
be	
critical	
.	

It	
is	
possible	
that	
PLMS	SYMPTOM
are	
a

Course	
and	
Complications	
Sleep

leg	SYMPTOM
cramps	SYMPTOM
have	
not	
been	
reported	
in	
infancy	
,	
nor	
in	
children	
younger	
than	
eight	
years	
.	

The	
peak

is	
usually	
in	
adulthood

but	
the	
condition	
may	
be	
seen	
for	
the	
first	
time

age

The	
natural	
history	
of	
leg	SYMPTOM

is	
not	
well	
under-

Many	
patients	
describe	
a	
waxing

of	
many	
years	
’	
duration	
.	

Complications	
include	
muscle	SYMPTOM
tenderness	SYMPTOM

and	
occasional	
daytime	
fatigue

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
Many	
sleep	
related

appear	
to	
be	
idiopathic	
.	

Although

they	
are

contractions	CONDITION

Some	
nocturnal	
leg	SYMPTOM
cramps	SYMPTOM
,	
particularly	
those	
in	
the	
feet	
,	
may	
resemble	
dystonias	SYMPTOM
but	
,	
unlike	
classic	
dystonias	SYMPTOM
,	
sleep	
related	
leg	
and	
foot	SYMPTOM
cramps	SYMPTOM
are	
relieved	
by	
stretching	
the	
affected	
muscle	
or	
muscles	
.	

Electrophysiologic	
recordings	
show	
that	
the	
cramps	
typically	
start	
with	
spontaneous	
firing	
of	
anterior	
horn	
cells	
followed	
by	
motor	
unit	
discharges	
for	
contractions	
at	
rates	
up	
to	
300	
Hz	
(	
considerably	
more	
than	
with	
voluntary	
muscle	
contractions	
)	
.	

The	
pain	
may	
result	
from	
local	
metabolite	
accumulations	
or	
from	
local	
ischemia	
.	

Muscle	
and	
tendon	
shortening	
due	
to	
age

stretching	
exercise	
is	
thought	
to	
contribute	
to	
the	
development	
of	
sleep	
related	
leg	SYMPTOM
cramps	SYMPTOM
.	

Exercise	
involving	
stretch-	
ing	
the

is	
thought	
to	
help	
prevent	
or	
reduce	
the	
occurrence

The	
prevalence

is	
highest	
in	
childhood	
(	
approximately	
14	
%

17	
%

and	
then	
decreases	
over	
the	
life	
span

In	
teenagers	
to	
young	
adults	
,	
prevalence	
is	
in	
the	
12	
%	
range

In	
young

it	
is	
approximately

The

genetic	CONCEPT

Recently	
,	
a	
serotonin	
gene	
was	
described	
in	
bruxism	SYMPTOM
patients	
but	
the	
absence	
of	
distinction	
between	
the	
wake	
and	
sleep	
forms	
in	
this	
report	
preclude	
firm	
conclusions	
.	

Precipitating	
factors	
can	
include	
anxiety	
related	
to	
current	
life	
events	
,	
tasks	
requir-	
ing	
high	
levels	
of	
performance

The	
use	
of	
cigarettes	RISKFACTOR
or	
caffeine	RISKFACTOR
in	
the	
hours	
before	
sleep	
also	
can	
contribute	
to	
the	
occur-	
rence	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	SYMPTOM
(	
probably	
due	
to	
the	
increased	
arousals	
and	
sleep

)	
.	

The	
role	
of	
dental	
morphologic	
“	
defects	
”	
(	
occlusal	SYMPTOM
interferences	SYMPTOM
)	
remains	
controver-	
sial	
in	
the	
etiology	
of	
sleep

Tooth

do	
not	
usually	
set

in	
some	
individuals	
,	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
occurs	
predominantly	
in	
REM	
sleep	
.	

As	
described	
above	
,	
the	
majority	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
episodes	
are	
temporally	
associated	
with	
sleep	
arousal	
and	
are	
preceded	
by	
signs	
of	
autonomic	
/	
cardiac	
activa-	
tion	
(	
e.g.	
,	
increased	
heart	
rate	
and	
blood	SYMPTOM
pressure	SYMPTOM
)	
.	

Three	
subtypes	
of	
the	
EMG	TEST
pattern	
of	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
have	
been	
described	
:	
phasic	
activity	
at	
1	
Hz	
frequency	
with	
EMG	TEST
bursts	
lasting	
0.25	
to	
2	
seconds	
;	
sustained	
tonic	
activity	
lasting	
longer	
than	
2	
seconds	
;	
or	
a	
mixed	
pattern	
.	

An	
episode	
begins	
after	
at	
least	
a	
three	
-	
second	
interval	
with	
no	
muscle	
activity	
.	

Polysomnography	
is	
not	
usually	
performed	
in	
otherwise	
healthy	
individuals	
with	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
in	
routine	
clinical	
settings	
.	

However	
,	
PSG	TEST
may	
be

To	
record	
and	
score	
sleep	
related	
bruxism	
activity	
(	
i.e.	
,	
RMMA	
)	

,	
there	
must	
be	
a	
minimum	
of	
one	
masseter	
muscle	
monitor	
,	
ideally	
with	
audiovisual	
recording	
,	
to	
associate	
muscular	
activity	
with	
grinding	
sound	
production	
.	

Video	
monitoring	
helps	
distinguish	
bruxism	
from	
other	
orofacial	
and	
masticatory	
movements	
that	
normally	
occur	
during	
sleep	
(	
e.g.

Essential	
Features	
Propriospinal	SYMPTOM
myoclonus	SYMPTOM
at	
sleep	
onset	
(	
PSM	SYMPTOM
)	SYMPTOM
consists	
of	
sudden	
myoclonic	SYMPTOM
jerks	SYMPTOM
occurring	
in	
the	
transition	
from	
wakefulness	
to	
sleep	
and	
,	
rarely	
,	
during	
intrasleep	
wakefulness	
and	
upon	
awakening	
in	
the	
morning	
.	

The	
jerks	SYMPTOM
arise	
mainly	
in	
the	
axial	
muscles	
and	
spread	
rostrally	
and	
caudally	
according	
to	
propriospinal	
propagation	
.	

The	
jerks	SYMPTOM
may	
be	
of	
variable	
intensity	
;	
they	
are	
isolated	
,	
recurring	
in	
quasi	
-	
periodic	
fashion	
for	
variable	
durations	
,	
or	
may	
be	
repeated	
in	
brief	
clusters	
of	
a	
few	
movements	
,	
sepa-	
rated	
by	
longer	
intervals	
.	
Jerks	SYMPTOM

The	
pattern	
of	
move-	
ment	
is	
usually	
flexor	
but	
may	
be	
an	
extension	
of	
the	
trunk	
.	

Vocalization	
rarely	
occurs	
.	

The	
jerks	SYMPTOM
are	
most	
often	
spontaneous	
but	
,	
in	
some	
cases	
,	
can	
be	
evoked	
by	
external	
stimulations	
.	

The	
jerks	SYMPTOM
appear	
to	
be

to	
the	
recumbent	
position

Any	
mental	
acti-	
vation	
makes	
the	
jerks	SYMPTOM
disappear	
.	

The	
jerks	SYMPTOM
eventually	
disappear	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
remain	
absent	
throughout	
all	
stages	
of	
sleep	
,	
even	
though	
they	
sometimes	
reappear	
during

PSM

In

myoclonic	SYMPTOM
jerks	SYMPTOM
involve	
the	
thoracoab-	
dominal

paraspinal	
or	
cervical	
muscles	
and	
spread	
caudally	
or	
rostrally	
to	
the	
other	
myotomes	
.	

The	
jerks	
are	
provoked	
or	
worsened	
by	
the	
recumbent	
position	
and	
can	
not	
be	
voluntarily	
suppressed

They	
are	
often

The	
frequent	
presleep	
worsening	
of	
daytime	
PSM	CONDITION
(	
around	
50	
%	
of	
the	
cases	
)	
suggests	
that	
patients	
with	
PSM	CONDITION
may	
have	
a	
milder

form	
of	
a

Patients	
may	
develop

Pathology	
and	
Pathophysiology	
The	
pathophysiology	
of	
PSM	CONDITION
is	
unknown	
.	
PSM	CONDITION
is	
thought	
to	
originate	
from	
a	
focal	
spinal	
pattern	
generator	
,	
set	
into	
motion	
by	
supraspinal	
dysfacilitatory	
influences	
typical	
of	
the	
state	
of	
relaxed	
wakefulness	
and	
drowsiness	
.	
PSM	CONDITION

A	
focal	
spinal	
generator	
thus	
is	
able	
to	
recruit	
muscles	
from	
multiple	
segments	
.

in

the	
posterior	
to	
the	
anterior	
brain	
regions

Epileptic

are	
not

Jerks	SYMPTOM

or	
with

Jerks	SYMPTOM
remain	
absent	
throughout	
sleep	
but	
may	
occasionally	
reappear	
upon	
awakening	
and	
during	
intrasleep	
wakefulness	
.	
Polysomnography	TEST
with	
extended	
EMG	TEST
recording	
demonstrates	
that	
the	
jerks	SYMPTOM
arise	
first	
in	
spinal	
innervated	
muscles	
and	
then	
propagate	
to	
more	
caudal	
and	
rostral	
muscles	
according	
to	
a	
propriospinal	
pattern	
of	
propagation	
.	

Detailed	
analysis	
of	
the	
jerks	SYMPTOM
shows	
that	
the	
EMG	
activity	
originates	
in	
muscles	
innervated	
by	
thoracic	
or	
cervical	
spinal	
segments	
(	
sternocleidomastoid	
,	
paraspinalis	
,	
rectus	
abdominis	
)	
and	
then	
spreads	
to	
more	
rostrally	
and	
caudally	
innervated	
muscles	
at	
a	
slow	
velocity	
(	
2	
to	
16	
milliseconds

around	
5	
milliseconds

contribution	
of	
EFM	CONDITION
to	
the

any

unknown

The	
course	
is	
not	
well	
studied	
but	
appears	
to	
be	
benign	
and	
non

progressive

The	
dis-	
order	
may	
be	
the	
sole	
abnormality	
in	
some	
cases

excessive	CONDITION

but	
causality	
is	
questionable

No	
other	
serious

been	
described

In	
some	
cases

EFM	CONDITION

Its	
relatively	
benign	
course	
sug-	
gests	
that	
it	
is	
not	
associated	
with	
a	
neurodegenerative	
process	
.	

In	
most	
reported	
cases	
,	
there	
have	
been	
associated	
sleep	SYMPTOM
abnormalities	SYMPTOM
and	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disruption	SYMPTOM
,	
suggesting	
that	
EFM	CONDITION
may	
be	
due	
to	
disruptions	
of	
normal	
motor	
-	
control	
mechanisms	
during	
sleep	
.	

Whether	
there	
is	
a	
genetic	
or	
other	
basis	
predisposing	
individuals	
to	
develop	
the	
condi-	
tion	
is	
unknown	
.	

In	
any	
case	
,	
it	
would	
appear	
to	
result	
from	
intensification	
of	
an	
other-	
wise	
normal	
motor	
phenomenon	
.	

The	
predominant	
topographic	
distribution	
of	
EFM	CONDITION
in	
distal	
and	
facial	
muscles	
suggests	
that	
cortical	
motor	
centers	
participate	
in	
its	
generation	
.	
EFM	CONDITION
is	
detected	
as	
isolated	
,	
very	
brief	
(	
usually	
75	
to	
150	
milliseconds	
)	
,	
asymmetrical

asynchronous	
EMG	TEST
potentials	
in	
various	
muscles	
of	
the	
face	
,	
trunk	
,	
arms	
,	
and	
legs	
.	

The	
amplitude	
varies	
from	
approximately	
50	
to	
several	
hundred	
microvolts	
;	
the	
taller	
amplitudes	
are	
often	
associated	
with	
visible	
movement	
of	
the	
fingers	
,	
toes	
,	
or	
corners	
of	
the	
mouth	
,	
whereas	
the	
smaller	
ones	
may	
resemble	
fasciculation	
potentials	
and	
be	
without	
overt	
movement	
.	

Large	
movements	
across	
large	
joint	
spaces	
preclude	
a	
diag-	
nosis	
of	
EFM	CONDITION

Small	
twitch	
-	
like	
movements	
may	
be	
observed	
on	
video	
recording	
.	

Episodes	
of	
these	
myoclonic	
potentials	
typically	
last	
from	
10	
minutes	
to	
several	
hours	
.	

They	
often	
appear	
at	
sleep	
onset	
and	
continue	
through	
the	
NREM	
sleep	
stages	
,	
includ-	
ing	
slow	
wave	
sleep	
.	

The	
presence	
of	
EFM	CONDITION
in	
REM	
is	
difficult	
to	
determine	
because	
it	
is	
superimposed	
on	
the	
normal	
phasic	
clusters	
of	
physiological	
phasic	
REM	
twitches	
.	
EFM	CONDITION
is	
electromyographically	
similar	
to	
the	
latter	
.	

Occasionally	
,	
the	
EMG	
activity	
also	
persists	
during	
EEG	TEST
periods	
of	
wakefulness	
within	
the	
sleep	
period	
or	
is	
present	
in	
drowsiness	
prior	
to	
sleep	
onset	
.	

The	
EEG	TEST
usually	
shows	
no	
changes	
at	
the	
time	
of	
the	
movements	
,	
although	
high	
-	
amplitude	
EMG	
potentials	
may	
be	
associated	
with	
a	
K	CONDITION
complex	CONDITION
or	
even	
with	
transient	
EEG	TEST

It	
seems	
possible	
that	
,	
depending	
on	
the	
digitalization	
rates	
,	
digital	
systems	
may	
record	
less	
fragmentary	
myoclonus	SYMPTOM

No

have	
been	
reported	
to	
be	
helpful	
in	
assessing	
EFM

EFM	CONDITION
generally	
has	
a	
maximum	
burst	
duration	
of	
only	
150	
milliseconds	
and	
does	
not	
recur	
periodically	
.	

It	
can	
be	
distinguished	
from	
PLMS	
because	
PLMS	
are	
character-	
ized	
by	
a	
longer	
burst	
duration	
(	
typically	
0.5	
to	
10	
seconds	
)	
and	
a	
long	
period	
between	
bursts	
(	
5	
-	
90	
seconds	
)	
.	

EFM	
,	
which	
occurs	
in	
NREM	CONCEPT
,	
must	
also	
be	
differentiated	
from	
normal	
physiological	
phasic	
REM	
twitches	
,	
which	
have	
a	
similar	
burst	
duration	
but	
are	
limited	
to	
the	
REM	
state	
and	
tend	
to	
occur	
in	
clusters	
within	
an	
epoch	
,	
as	
opposed	
to	
EFM	CONDITION
in	
which	
bursts	
tend	
not	
to	
cluster	
within	
a	
particular	
epoch	
.	

Larger

This

complained

awakenings

well	
as

The	
ALMA	CONDITION

symptoms	SYMPTOM
responded	
to	
treat-	
ment	
with	
pramipexole	TREATMENT

The	
single	
series	
in	
which	
HFT	TEST
was	
studied	
found	
that	
it	
occurs	
in	
7.5	
%	
of	
patients	
in	
whom	
a	
polysomnogram	TEST
was	
performed	
for	
other	
reasons	
.	

Affected	
individuals	
range	
in	
age	
from	
14	
to	
72	
years	
,	
with	
a	
majority	
in	
the	
middle	
-	
age	
range	
(	
40	
to	
65	
years	
)	
.	

Men	
and	
women	
are	
equally	
affected	
.	

It	
is	
possible	
that	
the	
frequency	
of	
these	
move-	
ments	
may	
be	
increased	
in	
individuals	
with	
disorders	
such	
as	
RLS	CONDITION
or	
SRBD	CONDITION

The	
prevalence	
of	
the	
condition	
in	
the	
general	
population	
and	
its	
frequency	
in	
affected	
individuals	
remains	
uncertain	
.	

The	
initial	
series	
reporting	
ALMA	CONDITION
found	
that	
it	
occurs	
in	
1.1	
%	
of	
unselected	
studies	
from	
a	
sleep	
disorder	
center	
.	

Patients	
with	
ALMA	CONDITION
were	
mostly	
male	
(	
11:5	
)	
and	
ranged	
in	
age	
from	
12	
to	
70	
years	
,	
with	
most	
aged	
35	
to	
55	
years	
(	
mean	
age	
41	
years	
)	
.	

Therefore	
,	
the	
age	
ranges	
of	
both	
conditions	
are	
similar	
,	
with	
both	
males	
and	
females	
affected	
.	

These	
distributions	
may	
be	
due	
to	
the	
incidental	
discovery

both

Because

Sleep	SYMPTOM
starts	SYMPTOM
(

hypnic	SYMPTOM
jerks	SYMPTOM
)	
usually	
consist	
of	
a	
single	
contraction

asymmetrically	
.	

The	
jerks	
may	
be	
either	
spontaneous	
or	
induced	
by	
stimuli	
.	

The	
motor	
activity	
is	
often	
associated	
with	
a	
sensory	
component	
,	
which	
may	
be	
somesthetic

hypnagogic	SYMPTOM
dreams	SYMPTOM

The

included	
a	
specific	
diagnosis

within	
this

.	

This	
diagnosis	
is	
infre-	
quently	
employed	
in	
the	
clinical	
setting	
and	
significant	
controversy	
exists	
regarding	
whether	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	
disturbance	
represents	
a	
clinical	
disorder	
per	
se	
.	

The	
condition	
is	
typically	
characterized	
by	
complaints	
of	
sleep	
initiation	
and/or	
maintenance	
that	
are	
the	
direct	
result	
of	
an	
environmental	CONCEPT
factor	CONCEPT

Associated	
daytime	SYMPTOM
symptoms	SYMPTOM
such	
as	
sleepiness	SYMPTOM
,	
fatigue	SYMPTOM
,	
or	
cognitive	SYMPTOM
or	
emotional	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
may	
be	
present	
.	

The	
environmental	
disturbance	
may	
be	
a	
physical	
stimulus	
such	
as	
noise	
(	
e.g.	
,	
vehicular	
traffic	
,	
aircraft	
,	
bed	
partner	
snoring	
)	
,	
light	
,	
temperature	
,	
movement	
(	
e.g.	
,	
bed	
partner	
movement	
disorder	
or	
parasomnia	
)	
,	
an	
emotional	
stimulus	
such	
as	
environ-	
mental	
danger	
(	
e.g.	
,	
combat	
setting	
or	
disaster	
area	
)	
,	
or	
an	
environmental	
requirement	
(	
such	
as	
caring	
for	
an	
infant	
or	
elderly	
family	
member	
)	
.	
Hospitalization	TREATMENT
is	
often	
cited	
as	
a	
precipitant	
of	
environmental	
sleep	
disturbance	
although	
many	
additional	
factors	
(	
e.g.	
,	
anxiety	
or	
pain	SYMPTOM
)	
may	
also	
contribute	
to	
sleep	
disturbance	
in	
this	
setting	
.	

If	
the	
clinician	
determines	
that	
an	
environmental	CONCEPT
factor	CONCEPT
is	
the	
primary	
cause	
of	
a

Unlike

,	
the	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbance	SYMPTOM
is	
dependent

the	
environmental	CONCEPT
factor	CONCEPT

In	
the	
absence	
of	
the	
stimu-	
lus	
,	
sleep	
is	
normal	
.	

The	
prevalence	
of	
environmentally	
induced	
sleep	SYMPTOM
disturbances	SYMPTOM
is	
not	
known	
although	
,	
as	
noted	
,	
the

not

cific	
characteristics	
that	
might	
predispose	
to	
this	
condition

Although	
environmental

play	
a

in	
some	
cases

Migraine	
headaches	
do	
not	
have	
a	
fixed	
association	
with	
a	
particular	
sleep	
stage	
.	

The	
patient	
may	
awaken	
with	
a	
migraine	
out	
of	
REM	
sleep	
,	
or	
the	
headaches	
may	
occur	
in	
relationship	
to	
stage	
N3	
sleep	
.	

A	
“	
classic	
migraine	
”	
headache	
is	
preceded	
by	
an	
aura	
(	
if	
the	
patient	
is	
awake	
)	
,	
which	
usually	
lasts	
four	
to	
60	
minutes	
and	
typically	
consists	
of	
homonymous	SYMPTOM
visual	SYMPTOM
field	SYMPTOM
defects	SYMPTOM
and	
scintillating	SYMPTOM
scotomas	SYMPTOM
.	

In	
some	
patients	
,	
the	
aura	
may	
continue	
or	
even	
begin	
during	
the	
headache	
phase	
.	

In	
contrast	
,	
“	
common	
migraine	
”	
does	
not	
start	
with	
an	
aura	
.	

Other	
signs	
of	
neurological	CONDITION

may	
include	
unilateral	SYMPTOM
paresthesias	SYMPTOM

hemiplegia	CONDITION

The	
hemiplegia	CONDITION
is	
ipsilateral	
or	
contralateral	
to	
the	
side	
of	
the	
headache	SYMPTOM
.	
Cluster	SYMPTOM
headaches	SYMPTOM
are	
severe	
,	
unilateral	
,	
periorbital	
or	
temporal	
headaches	
that	
start	
quickly	
and	
peak	
within	
10	
to	
15	
minutes	
.	

They	
have	
a	
relatively	
shorter	
duration	
,	
usually	
lasting	
15	
minutes	
to	
three	
hours	
(	
mean	
,	
60	
minutes	
)	
.	

The	
headaches	
occur	
daily	
during	
cluster	
periods	
—	
usually	
one	
to	
three	
attacks	
per	
day	
over	
a	
period	
of	
one	
to	
two	
months	
.	

Most	
patients	
have	
one	
cluster	
period	
per	
year

though	
this	
can	
vary	
from	
patient	
to

Several	
anatomic	
areas	
are	
common

the	
physiology

both

these	
include	
the	
brainstem

the	
ventrolateral

the

From	
a	
neurochemical	
perspective	
,	
ade-	
nosine	
,	
melatonin

and	
orexin	
also	
are	
involved	
in	
both	
the

the

Dysfunction

are
